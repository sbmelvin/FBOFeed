<DESC>The DPA Title III objective of the Phase 1 effort is to maintain, modernize, and expand existing domestic, economically viable, merchant supplier production capabilities in the manufacture of complex, large, multi-core magnesium and aluminum sand casting products for rotorcraft platforms.
<p>Scope: The capacity expansion will be achieved through a mix of government and recipient investments to recapitalize aging foundries and strengthen a diminishing supply base in order to meet DoD rotorcraft part requirements.  Investments will focus on a series of measures designed to increase production efficiencies and/or improve part quality, thus reducing lead times, reworks and costs.</p>

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source WTC Health Program Survivor Clinic
<SOLNBR>2018-N-67766
<RESPDATE>123017
<CONTACT>Abbie Jemmott, Contracting Officer, Phone 4123866433, Email ygf3@cdc.gov
<DESC>This Notice of Intent to award a sole source cost reimbursable contract for a Survivor Clinical Center of Excellence is provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Office of Acquisition Services (OAS), Branch 4 on behalf of the National Institute for Occupational Safety &amp; Health (NIOSH), World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program.
<p>On January 2, 2011, the President signed the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010 (Zadroga Act) into law. This law amended the Public Health Service Act, establishing the WTC Health Program, to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The WTC Health Program provides medical monitoring and treatment for FDNY employees as well as General Responders. General Responders includes emergency responders, recovery, and cleanup workers, and volunteers who helped after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and the crash site near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The WTC Health Program also provides health evaluations and treatment for eligible people who were present in the dust or dust cloud on 9/11 or who worked, resided, or attended school, childcare, or adult daycare in the New York City disaster area for a period of time on 9/11 and/or during the following months. This population is known as Survivors.</p>
<p>On December 18, 2015, President Obama signed into law a bill reauthorizing the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. This includes reauthorization of the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program for 75 years, ending in 2090.</p>
<p>NIOSH is the Institute within HHS which administers the WTC Health Program. The Program is administered through contracts with 7 Clinical Centers of Excellence (CCE) within the NY Metropolitan Area. There is currently 1 CCE to serve FDNY responders, 5 CCEs to serve General Responders, and 1 CCE to serve Survivors. There is also a contract for a Nationwide Provider Network (NPN) to serve members outside the NY Metropolitan Area. The NPN serves both Responders and Survivors.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2017, there are 82,190 members enrolled in the WTCHP. These numbers include 51,897 general responders, 16,920 FDNY responders, and 13,373 survivors. It is estimated that the potential number of eligible responders is close to 90,000 and the potential eligible number of survivors is over 400,000 - meaning that the highest potential growth for the Program is within the survivor cohort.</p>
<p>Starting in June 2017 the survivor cohort numbers increased dramatically and to a point that the Program does not have capacity to see all the members through the current survivor CCE in the NY Metropolitan area.</p>
<p>The WTC Health Program requires a temporary surge clinic in the NY Metropolitan area to accommodate new survivor enrollees who are needing evaluation and treatment. The anticipated period of performance for this contract is a 1-year base period and 2 6-month option periods. <br /><br />The intended recipient of this purchase order is: Logistics Health Inc with a mailing address of 328 Front Street South, La Crosse, Wisconsin 54601-4023.</p>
<p>This order is for supplies and/or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 15. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability by responding to this notice.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all quotations/responses received within 15 days of the issuance of this notice will be considered by the government. A determination by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Responses should be emailed to Abbie Jemmott, Contracting Officer at ajemmott@cdc.gov no later than 11:00am EST December 30, 2017. No telephonic quotes will be processed.</p>

<DESC><p>Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is issuing solicitation SPE4A2-17-R-0032 to support the H-53E Performance Based Sustainment Support Initiative. The purpose of this action is to add approximately 2,190 National Stock Numbers (NSNs) with a total estimated value of $212.5M to the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation (Sikorsky) Long Term Contract (LTC) SPE4AX-15-D-9002 as a separate performance-based support subsumable contract with performance metrics and incentives/disincentives tied to achieving improved customer outcomes. This performance based project will include approximately 1,400 Sikorsky Sole Source NSNs. The solicitation will be unrestricted with a projected solicitation issuance date of 8 JAN 18 and a projected close date of 9 APR 18. The place of performance will be the Contiguous United States (CONUS). This population of items meets the definition of bundling at FAR 2.101, and it is likely unsuitable for award to a small business due to the diversity, size, or specialized nature of the elements of the performance specified.</p>
<p>DLA has determined that measurably substantial benefits are expected to be derived as a result of the bundling as defined at FAR 7.107-3. The expected benefits of this bundling action are and summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Cost savings</p>
<p>(2) Price reduction</p>
<p>(3) Quality improvements that will save time or improve or enhance performance or efficiency</p>
<p>(4) Reduction in acquisition cycle times</p>
<p>(5) Better terms and conditions</p>
<p>(6) Anticipated financial benefits equivalent to five (5) percent of the estimated contract (including options)</p>
<p>The Government intends to use a letter solicitation; therefore, any interested sources must notify the contracting officer prior to the synopsis closing date and submit a complete response on how the offeror would provide the population of NSNs to support the H-53E including a complete response to the Government Sources Sought. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and Small Business Administration Procurement Center Representative (SBA PCR), michael.massello@sba.gov. The Government may alter the acquisition strategy if sufficient information is received on how another offeror can fully support the NSN population and provide the desired customer outcomes.</p>

<p>Quantity: 7. Unit of Issue: EA. Destination Information: Tracy, CA. Delivery Schedule: 145 days.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer/quote which shall be considered. The solicitation will be available in FedBizOpps on its issue date of 6 JUL 2017. The Small Business size standard is 750 employees. Specifications, plans or drawings are not available.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for supplies for which the Government does not possess complete, unrestrictive technical data; therefore, the Government intends to solicit and contract with only approved sources under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Approved source is: Hunt Valve Company, Inc. (34889).</p>
<p>While price may be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final award decision will be based upon a combination of price, delivery, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>
<p>One or more of the items under this acquisition may be subject to an Agreement on Government Procurement approved and implemented in the United States by the Trade Agreement Act of 1979. All offers shall be in the English language and in U.S. dollars. All interested suppliers may submit an offer.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Various quantities solicited: 5 - 7, 8 - 10, and 11 - 12.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Scientific Operations (OSO) at the Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) intends to procure Business Analyst services on a sole-source basis from an economically disadvantaged women owned small business from Malbaie Solutions Inc, 23929 Burdette Forest Rd, Clarksburg, MD 20871. The Business Analyst services will focus on business processes and business intelligence associated with the systems used in operation of the FFRDC, and identification of areas for systems and process improvement.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 561499 and the business size standard is $15.0 Million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price time and materials contract. In addition, the award shall be made as a set aside to an economically disadvantaged women owned small business.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months base and one twelve (12) month option.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) is a Government-Owned Contractor-Operated (GOCO), Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), sponsored by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and established in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 35.017. The Government utilizes federal, DHHS, NIH, and NCI business systems for the conduct and reporting of business actions. The Operator of the FFRDC must maintain electronic business systems for GOCO operations and activities. The current Federal and Contractor business systems environment needs to reflect a comprehensive understanding and integration of these systems.</p>
<p>The Contractor the services provided by this support include resolution of issues with OSO IAAs to allow chargeback and collection; database that combines NBS obligations and disbursements on the FFRDC contracts and allows reporting as required by FFRDC Stakeholders; and Business Intelligence which shall identify Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and ensure that data brought into the systems can be generated into reports and deliverables that align with KPIs. Automated custom reporting and database queries shall be developed and access provided to FFRDC stakeholders, based on role (Contracting Officer, Contracting Officer's Representative, other stakeholders). <br />Malbaie Solutions Inc has unique knowledge of NCI Frederick specific system's architecture and has developed analytical tools based on that knowledge to rapidly assess anomalies in data sets transferred between NBS and NCI Frederick Deltek Costpoint. The accuracy of these verification steps and established process controls are essential to accomplish the desired outcome of the project and within the performance period defined. Malbaie Solutions has prior experience developing software releases to NIH Business System (NBS) and Procurement Information System for Management (PRISM) along with development of Merlin acquisitions software releases used at many NIH Consolidated Operations and Acquisition Centers (COACs). Malbaie Solutions staff have extensive working knowledge of NIH purchase request software like Purchasing On-line Tracking System (POTS) including the CIT web-service interface that bridges them to NBS Oracle. Malbaie Solutions staff have experience at the nVision Data Warehouse where they managed the implementation of many of the current solutions, provides them with the unique capability to create data marts for analytics and business intelligence capabilities by sourcing data from nVision, Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), and NCI Frederick custom applications. This unique experience developing SQL based extraction queries from nVision to source NBS and NIH Enterprise Data (NED) and integrate the data with the FNLCR systems has not been replicated by other Contractors. Their experience is unmatched in creating customized analytical tools and outputs sourced from nVision, other NIH enterprise and NCI systems, along with mapping those data sets back to NCI specific business processes and workflows. These individual system skills coupled with the ERP and custom development skills makes Malbaie Solutions uniquely positioned to extend that knowledge into this project within days of award.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small businesses, believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 11:00AM EST, on December 26, 2017.

<p>ATTENTION small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort:</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Nov 2011) ... (c) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ". Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>ATTENTION all potential respondents:</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy for this program has not been finalized. If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on the requirement and what areas are likely candidates for SB subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. Capability Survey Questions</p>
<p>1. Is your firm registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), formally known as Central Contractor Registration (CCR)? In accordance with federal regulations, all contractors doing business with the federal government must be registered in the SAM database.</p>
<p>2. Describe briefly the capabilities of the nature of the services you provide.</p>
<p>3. Describe your company's past experience on previous with similar services. Include contract numbers, a brief description of the work performed, period of performance, agency/organization supported, and individual point of contact (Contracting Officer or Program Manager).</p>
<p>4. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?</p>
<p>5. Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public? Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions? Briefly describe any differences.</p>
<p>If your company is interested, submit your responses to jessica.stamper.2@us.af.mil E-mail responses should be received no later than 2:00 PM EST on 18 Dec 2017.</p>
<p>All responses must be UNCLASSIFIED; no classified material will be accepted or considered with this Sources Sought Synopsis. The response to Part I. Business Information should be single spaced, 12pt font. The response to Part II. Capabilities should be limited to no more than 10 pages (8.5x11 inches), single spaced, 12pt font. In addition, identify a representative to support further Government inquiries and requests for clarification of the information provided, if needed. Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly. The Air Force will handle proprietary items in accordance with FAR 2.101 and 3.104.</p>
<p>Responses to questions from interested parties will be promptly answered and posted on this FedBizOps website, unless some release of proprietary information is involved or the answer addresses a question peculiar to a company or that company's response. Information feedback sessions may be offered to respondents after the sources sought assessments are completed. An Industry Day (date to be determined) with one-on-one information sessions with respondents may be offered to clarify the Government's understanding of their submittal, the capability ramifications, or to discuss their business approach.</p>

<DESC><p>Statement of Capabilities (SOC) instructions and the draft task order is included in Attachment 1 to this announcement.<br /><br />Purpose<br />This is a Sources Sought. The Space and Missile Systems Center, Remote Sensing Systems Directorate (SMC/RS) located at Los Angeles Air Force Base, California, is seeking information in the form of Statements of Capabilities (SOC) from interested parties in support of the SMC/RS Data Exploitation Division (SMC/RSX) requirement described below.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to identify potential sources that can meet SMC/RSX's requirement. The Government reserves the right, and intends, to set this acquisition, or portions thereof, aside for small business - to include socially and economically disadvantaged businesses, 8(a) firms, or woman-owned businesses.<br /><br />Currently, the Government anticipates that the contractor shall have to provide a workforce of approximately 16 personnel, but is requesting feedback from Industry if there are reasons to have a much larger or smaller workforce. Contract will start in USG Fiscal Year (FY) 2018. Current estimated award will be in 2nd or 3rd Quarter of FY18.<br /><br />The Government anticipates a base contract of 2 years, with three 1-year options.<br /><br />Background &amp; Description<br /><br />There are three components to this requirement: 1) Maintenance and operations of an open systems architecture, called the Sensor Open Framework Architecture (SOFA); 2) development and operations of a data exploitation laboratory, called the Tools, Applications, and Processing (TAP) Lab; and 3) development and operations of the OPIR Battlespace Awareness Center (OBAC). The TAP Lab, in Boulder, CO, and the OBAC, on Buckley Air Force Base, CO, are located approximately 50 miles apart. Satisfaction of this contract will require the vendor to provide management services, technical direction functions, logistics supports, hardware and software management, and management of final facilities fit-up.<br /><br />SMC/RS is charged with developing overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) and defense weather systems to meet the needs of Department of Defense (DoD) operational elements. The Commander, Air Force Space Command (AFSPC/CC), has given SMC/RS direction to pursue activities that will enable the maximization of OPIR data exploitation and dissemination. To accomplish this, a lab environment has been created in Boulder, CO that promotes, where appropriate, competition between algorithms, collaboration among developers, and allows plug and play of different mission data processing applications with ease. The Tools, Applications and Processing (TAP) Laboratory features an open systems architecture, called the Sensor Open Framework Architecture (SOFA). SOFA was developed by Lockheed Martin's APEX team and is used in the lab to develop "plug-and-play" mission data processing applications. The Government retains full rights to the framework code and documentation, which will be managed through this effort. SOFA is also used in the OPIR Battlespace Awareness Center (OBAC), offering the potential for smoother transition of new capabilities into the operations baseline. Although the OBAC is the path for transition to operations for the Battlespace Awareness mission, other products developed in the lab may transition to other operational users in the appropriate location for their use. The TAP lab is a stand-alone capability separate from the OBAC and will serve as a development space for multiple operational users.<br /><br />The intent of the attached Statement of Work is to describe the services required to maintain and operate SOFA; develop and operate the TAP Lab; and develop and operate the OBAC.<br /><br />The TAP Lab is located in leased space in Boulder, Colorado, in space the SBIRS ground segment development contractor vacated. The TAP Lab achieved interim capability in April 2016. Under current plans, the contractor selected for this effort will establish the permanent lab in the same facility sometime in 2018. The initial capability is in a DoD Secret environment. Additional environments for unclassified and SCI levels will be established during the period of performance of this contract.<br /><br />The OBAC is the operational facility for the Battlespace Awareness mission and is located within the SBIRS Mission Control Station (MCS) at Buckley AFB, Colorado. It entered a period of "early operations" in early 2016. It is temporarily housed in a room initially designed for use by technical intelligence; under current plans, the framework custodian contractor will modify the OBAC into its final configuration. This will include relocating workstations within the operations area, relocating servers within the computer room, modifying the existing room or moving to a different room in the MCS. Detailed designs will be complete and available for the contractor selected for this work to use to modify the facility. The framework custodian contractor selected for this work will also provide interim logistics support for the OBAC.<br /><br />At a minimum, respondants to this sources sought must have, or be able to establish, the capabilities described in the attached draft task statement.<br /><br />The Government mandates participation from its FFRDC, SE&amp;I and A&amp;AS contractors, during the analysis of SOCs received in response to this synopsis. Specifically, the Government will require participation from the following contractors: Aerospace Corp, MITRE, LinQuest, SAIC, Riverside Research, SDL.</p>
<p>All data received in response to this synopsis and marked or designated as "corporate" or "proprietary information" will be fully protected from release outside the Government except for the support contractors listed above.</p>

CBP will not pay for any cost associated with responding to this RFI.  All costs will be solely at the interested party's expense.

<p><br />BACKGROUND: <br />The CBP US Border Patrol (USBP) Tucson Sector requires trash services for various and extended locations throughout the Tucson Sector Area of Operations (AOR). Because of the vast geographic area to be covered for these services, typically the requirement has been split between locations. This request for information is a means to gain information from Industry partners on the available capabilities to service all locations with a single vendor. This RFI seeks to obtain information from industry that will provide USBP Tucson Sector with insight into market conditions and capabilities that will aid in the formation of an acquisition strategy.<br /><br />WORK SCOPE: <br />USBP is interested in obtaining information related to existing capabilities from Industry to provide a single Point of Contact Service Provider for all solid waste removal requirements as outlined, from vastly geographically separated locations encompassing the USBP Tucson Sector AOR. <br />CBP intends for the contractor to perform the scope of work outlined in the attached Statement of Work (SOW) for each location. Historical frequency of solid waste services is included as a benchmark for required services, but a formal schedule would be provided by any prospective contractor for approval by the Government in the event of an actual solicitation. Prospective Offerors for any potential solicitation should review the full requirements of the SOW in order to make a determination as to whether or not they can provide the services required in a single integrated solution for all locations.<br /><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:<br />Interested parties are requested to provide an information package, in WORD or PDF format, which includes the following:<br /><br />A.    Company Profile - not to exceed one page, 12-point Times New Roman font, including the Company name and address, point-of-contact, DUNS #, business size status and social economic status</p>
<p>B.    Brief Company Capability Statement - not to exceed four pages, 12-point Times New Roman font, describing relevant experience. If citing contracts, identify the customer, contact number, and total dollar value. Identify whether the company participated as the prime contractor or a subcontractor. Please also describe any experience with commercial services. Describe any unique capabilities over and above those required to meet requested capabilities that could be provided to enhance and aide the services as indicated.<br /> <br />C.    Description of Equipment and Capabilities Available - not to exceed nine pages, 12-point Times New Roman font, that support all of the services identified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW).  Included in this description should be the following, at a minimum:<br />&#61607;	Equipment available.<br />&#61607;	Trucks and/or transportation capabilities.<br />&#61607;	Staffing capabilities.<br />&#61607;	Management capabilities.</p>
<p>OTHER INFORMATION:<br />Please adhere to the requested page limits.  CBP may not review any pages beyond the limits stated for each section.  However, CBP may review information including appendices, marketing brochures, catalogs, etc. CBP will consider the responses to help further define the requirement, determine the acquisition strategy, and identify interest and the ability of the vendor community to provide services in the areas outlined in this RFI. Respondents shall mark proprietary information as such to be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.<br />The Government may conduct "One-on-One" discussions with responders with existing, fully-developed solutions that meet the Services Requirements, as well as, with other responders to gather additional information. CBP may also seek to gather additional information through other published and non-published means if necessary.  <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please submit the requested information by e-mail only to: Contract Specialist Benjamin Dorgan at benjamin.j.dorgan@cbp.dhs.gov by <strong>5:00 p.m. EST on 12 January 2018.</strong></span> All submissions (email including attachments) must be less than 10MB (zip files will not be accepted).

The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto.
<p><br />NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is investigating vendors who can provide space-qualified Solar Array Panels that will provide power for the NASA GSFC PACE Mission. The purpose of this RFI is to survey vendor capabilities to meet the mission requirements in the attached Draft Performance Specification (SPEC), Draft Statement of Work (SOW), and Draft Deliverable Items List and Schedule (DILS).</p>

Where there is non-compliance, please state if the Draft SPEC is considered unnecessarily stringent or if a Non Recurrent Effort (NRE) could be pursued to achieve compliance on that particular requirement (and associated cost).</p>
<p>Although the draft SPEC, SOW, and DILS all assume the substrate will be provided as government furnished equipment (GFE), as an option, the government would like the responder to provide a cost and schedule of providing the entire solar array (including the panels, all substrate, qual testing, and associated analysis, e.g., structural).

<DESC><p>The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) is looking to enhance its Post Irradiation Examination (PIE) functionality by developing an in-canal PIE station (ANDES). One of the functions desired for this station is the ability to do surface evaluations on cladding containing radiologically active materials. The technology identified for this purpose is laser metrology or laser scanning. The purpose of this request is to identify parties with developed technologies applicable to underwater laser metrology. Specific operating conditions and performance requirement are identified in the attached Statement of Work (SOW). Primary requirements include the following:</p>
<p>Being able to scan underwater and through a water barrier (scanner will not be able to contact the specimen);</p>
<p>Scan a 210 in2 area at 25 &micro;m spatial resolution within 4 hours;</p>
<p>Scan a 210 in2 area at 100 &micro;m spatial resolution within 2 hours;</p>
<p>System shall be resilient to radiation damage up to 500 rad/hr gamma dose rate.</p>
<p>It is assumed that existing laser metrology technologies may require some modifications to be able to adapt to the ANDES station and be able to provide the required functionality and resolution. It is further assumed that in order to guarantee performance, the provider may want to design their own handling system for the scanner. The attached SOW is developed in a manner that will allow the supplier to participate in the design process and design a custom handling system, data collection system and control system applicable to the location of use.</p>
<p>The bid will require identification and selection of existing laser metrology systems applicable for this use. Selection of the winning big will largely depend on the ability of the existing technology to meet the performance requirements. After selection of the winning bidder, phase 1 and 2 are effectuated and include the design of the handling system, control system and data collections system. These technologies may already exist and require little or no development, which will simplify the phase 1 and 2 efforts. Phase 3 includes procurement of the laser scanner equipment. Phase 4 includes fabrication and/or procurement of the handling system, control system and data collection system.</p>
<p>Phase 1 conceptual design will need to be completed by June 15, 2018. Phase 2 will need to be completed by June 15, 2019. The complete ANDES system milestone is completion by September 30, 2019. With completion of the ANDES system design, funding will be sought to procure and install the system. It is anticipated that this procurement of the scanner and associated systems would happen in calendar year 2020.</p>
<p>Interested parties are asked to express their interest to Mitch Hodges via email (mitch.hodges@inl.gov) by 5:00 p.m. on Jan. 10, 2018.</p>

<p>Background/Mission:</p>
<p>The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP&reg;) is a program of the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The MEP National Network<sup>TM</sup> comprises NIST MEP, 51 MEP Centers located in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and its 1,300 trusted advisors and experts at nearly 600 MEP service locations, providing any U.S. manufacturer with access to resources they need to succeed. MEP Centers are funded by a combination of Federal, State, local and private resources; and focus on helping small and medium-size manufacturers (SMMs)generate business results and thrive in today's technology-driven economy.</p>
<p>MEP's mission is to enhance the productivity and technology performance of U.S. manufacturing by acting as a trusted, strategic advisor to promote business growth and connecting manufacturers to public and private resources essential for increased competitiveness and profitability. Centers tailor services to meet critical needs, ranging from process improvement and workforce development to specialized business practices, including supply chain integration, innovation, and technology transfer. MEP's foundation is built upon its partnerships. Centers are the hub for manufacturers, connecting them with government agencies, trade associations, universities and research laboratories, state and federal initiatives, and a host of other resources to help them grow and innovate.</p>
<p>Scope of Requirement:</p>
<p>Currently, NIST's MEP has a need for ordering vehicle to assist MEP in successfully fulfilling their mission, as stated above. One of the principle goals of this requirement is to for the Contractor to understand the current and future development and delivery capabilities of the network. This will be accomplished by establishing mechanisms to discover the current and future needs of U.S.-based small manufacturers and translating that information into actionable strategies and plans to enhance the development, delivery and quality of products and services delivered by the Centers and foster coordination of those organizations that comprise this network. The contract will provide additional resources and subject matter expertise to expand and accelerate MEP's ability to serve as a trusted advisor for U.S. manufacturing.</p>
<p>Specifically, strategies and plans will be developed and executed to support expansion and deeper leverage of resources to integrate cost reduction strategies with profitable growth. The successful deployment of these strategies, services and products will further enable the MEP National Network to most effectively serve as the critical connecting point for manufacturers, state and local governments, private sector resources, research organizations, and the federal government. To respond to this expanded need, MEP will, with support from this contract, develop new networks and partnerships that companies require to realize an enduring competitive position in the global market. These efforts will further promote the transition from reactive strategies to the proactive pursuit of increased profits and overall growth by helping manufacturers to understand the value of their marketable assets in light of these drivers.</p>

<SUBJECT>69--Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) Integrated Training Systems and Support
<SOLNBR>N6134018R0043
<CONTACT>joseph willdigg - contract specialist - joseph.willdigg@navy.mil
<DESC>Introduction

The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD), Orlando, FL seeks potential sources with the ability to provide Live, Virtual, Constructive (LVC) Integrated Training Systems and continued life-cycle support of established LVC systems under NAWCTSDs cognizance. LVC systems provide virtual maintenance and operational training of U.S. Navy systems to U.S. Navy watch standers. The development of new training systems and upgrades to existing training systems will include training for individual, team, and/or multi-team training requirements.

Responses received for this notice will serve as a consideration for the governments decision to fulfill this requirement under a set-aside, full and open competition, or sole source acquisition.
  Additionally, the requested information will be taken into account for acquisition planning purposes.

It is anticipated that any contract action associated with this notice will result in a single award, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract on a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) and/or Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) basis, with either a five (5) year base ordering period or a five (5) year base ordering period and two (2) one (1) year option periods. The estimated contract ceiling is approximately $49.9M.  

Background

LVC systems were previously known as Live, Virtual, and Constructive Modeling and Simulation (LVCMS) systems.  The LVC training systems and devices provide a wide range of training capabilities to various Department of Defense (DoD) communities.
 LVC training devices are located in various school houses and fleet concentration centers throughout the world. Some of the LVC training systems are used as training gap fillers until suitable devices can be delivered in the future. Other LVC training systems are designed to support integrated and coordinated Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Virtual At-Sea Training (VAST) tactical training, Anti-Access Area-Denial (A2AD) and Cyber Warfare using Joint Semi-Automated Forces (JSAF) Navy Training Baseline (NTB) simulation. Some current training system configurations are comprised of personal computers (PC) with each PC system representing a mission training station in a particular aircraft (i.e. SH-60B, SH-60F, P-3C ), shipboard system or combat systems, when in a networked environment, allow for integrated mission training.
 These LVC systems primarily use Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware and various commercial software products and operating systems to emulate, simulate, and/or stimulate various training systems for training purposes. Commercial item PC technology changes rapidly and it is not unusual for systems to become unsupportable over a period of time.  When this happens, the government will have to replace the existing LVC training systems comprised of PC hardware with the latest PC technology and latest software in order to be compliant with the Department of Defense (DoD) Information Technology (DoDI 8510.01) Risk Management Framework.  Additionally, NAWCTSD has a requirement to provide continued life cycle support of established LVC training systems under NAWCTSDs cognizance.
 

Requirements

The contractor shall provide design, development, integration, test, delivery, and sustainment support for the LVC training systems and ASW VAST family of training systems, to include installation support at various locations.  The contractor shall design the training systems for compatibility with anticipated changes in products such as operating systems and JSAF NTB.  The contractor shall also design and develop operable training systems within the Navy Continuous Training Environment (NCTE) using JSAF NTB.  The contractor shall research, design, test, evaluate, integrate, implement and support transition of training solutions.  In addition, the contractor shall provide upgrades to include software patches to the existing trainers plus develop and field new training solutions emulating other military systems.
 The government laboratory for testing and integration of software and hardware is located in Orlando, Florida.  The contractor shall provide the sustainment and Fleet Synthetic Training (FST) support of LVC training systems at multiple sites including multiple OCONUS DoD sites.

These efforts shall require support to and coordination with various working groups and participation in the System Engineering Technical Review (SETR) process.  The contractor shall support the submission of its technologies to the SETR process and its build-test-build approach to technology maturation.  In addition, the contractor shall conduct design, development, testing, analysis and documentation under the guidance of the various working groups.
  The contractor shall support integration, test, and delivery.  The contractor shall update its product to address the findings of the working groups. 

The government shall retain government purpose rights to all source code and data pertaining to the design, component specifications, hardware, software, processes and procedures developed under this contract.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information (RFI) on Procuring Material and Component Level Test Specimens from Cargo Tank Motor Vehicles Made with Fiber-Reinforced Plastic Materials
<SOLNBR>6913G618RFI0001
<RESPDATE>013118
<CONTACT> Hailing Yu, Civil Engineer, Phone 6174942554, Email hailing.yu@dot.gov - Peter Wallace, Phone 6174943644, Email peter.wallace@dot.gov
<DESC><p>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ONLY. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND: The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe) is currently conducting a study to establish experimental testing procedures and develop a finite element analysis (FE) framework that can be used to evaluate the performance and determine the specifications of cargo tank motor vehicles (CTMV) made with fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials. Because the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) do not address the specific performance requirements for FRP CTMVs, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has been issuing special permits with renewable terms for commercial companies to manufacture, sell and use FRP cargo tanks for the highway HM transportation. With increasing omnipresence and acceptance of the FRP CTMVs as an industrial standard for transporting corrosive HM, there have been calls to include FRP CTMV performance requirements in the HMR, so as to not only maximize the FRP CTMVs' safety potential but also relieve both the PHMSA and the industrial stakeholders of the burden of the special permit application, authorization and renewal processes. The ultimate goal of the Volpe study is to provide performance data and technical parameters for PHMSA's consideration in possible rulemaking of the FRP CTMVs. The first phase of this study will include obtaining FRP specimens from commercial FRP cargo tank packaging manufacturers, conducting material and component level testing on the FRP specimens, and developing FE model parameters using the material and component level test data. A second phase of the study will include developing full scale FE models of FRP CTMVs and conducting numerical simulations to evaluate their performance.</p>
<p><br />SCOPE: Volpe is seeking information from FRP CTMV manufacturers, domestic and international, on their willingness, ability and requirements to provide Volpe with the physical specimens as well as material and CTMV information needed to conduct the above described study. Volpe will use this information to re-engage industry at a future date regarding a more specific request. At this point, we are seeking industry informational input only regarding the feasibility and willingness to provide Volpe with physical specimens (sizes to be determined) at no cost (preferred), or at some price, material/design specifications, and cargo tank design drawings.</p>
<p><br />All interested FRP CTMV manufacturers are invited to respond to this RFI. The response should address the following items that Volpe finds critical to conduct the FRP CTMV study:</p>
<p><br />1. Willingness to provide your manufacturing process, capacity to provide samples, and ability to provide FRP specimens conforming to the technical requirements set forth in HMR and/or special permits or extracted from FRP CTMVs currently/previously in production and/or use;<br />2. Your willingness to donate or sell FRP specimens to Volpe for third-party testing based on industrial standards such as ASTM test standards (to be specified at a later date);<br />3. Your ability to prepare/cut the FRP specimens in predefined geometries and sizes (to be determined), any limitations in the quantities of FRP specimens that you can provide<br />4. Required lead time to prepare and deliver the specimens;<br />5. Descriptions of estimated prices of specimens if you will be unable to donate the FRP specimens (because the exact sizes and quantities of the FRP specimens have not been defined, the estimates may be given for individual unit prices, bulk quantities, volume discounts, etc);<br />6. Your ability and willingness to share manufacturer's materials specifications of the FRP specimens, which will be protected by the Volpe Center as proprietary information;<br />7. Your ability to share FRP CTMV drawings, which will be protected by the Volpe Center as proprietary information, with sufficient structural details for Volpe to develop full scale FE models useful for evaluating the performance of the FRP CTMVs;<br />8. Discussion of proprietary information safeguards such as confidentiality/nondisclosure agreements that you will require to enter into agreement with Volpe for any of the materials/information provided in Items 1-7;<br />9. Recommendations on material and component level test requirements, types of material and component level tests to be conducted, number of repeated tests to establish repeatability, specimen geometry, specimen size, etc. (see related sources sought 6913G618RFI0002 regarding laboratory capabilities).</p>
<p><br />Any other comments that can help Volpe better define the research scope and direction and ultimately yield technical data beneficial to both the government and the industry are welcome.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this sources Sought shall be submitted electronically to hailing.yu@dot.gov and peter.wallace@dot.gov or by mail to the address provide below.</p>
<p><br />The information will be used by the Government to develop requirements for a potential upcoming research and test project.</p>
<p>There is no requirement to respond to this Sources Sought in order to be eligible to submit a proposal in response to any formal Request for Proposal (RFP) that may result from this potential project. However, the Government places tremendous value on the information received and may utilize it to finalize its acquisition strategy. Interested small business companies are strongly encouraged fully use this opportunity to describe their capabilities.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER<br />This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation.

<DESC>BACKGROUND: The Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe) is currently conducting a study to establish experimental testing procedures and develop a finite element analysis (FE) framework that can be used to evaluate the performance and determine the specifications of cargo tank motor vehicles (CTMV) made with fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials. Because the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) do not address the specific performance requirements for FRP CTMVs, the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has been issuing special permits with renewable terms for commercial companies to manufacture, sell and use FRP cargo tanks for the highway HM transportation. With increasing omnipresence and acceptance of the FRP CTMVs as an industrial standard for transporting corrosive HM, there have been calls to include FRP CTMV performance requirements in the HMR, so as to not only maximize the FRP CTMVs' safety potential but also relieve both the PHMSA and the industrial stakeholders of the burden of the special permit application, authorization and renewal processes. The ultimate goal of the Volpe study is to provide performance data and technical parameters for PHMSA's consideration in possible rulemaking of the FRP CTMVs. The first phase of this study will include obtaining FRP specimens from commercial FRP cargo tank packaging manufacturers, conducting material and component level testing on the FRP specimens, and developing FE model parameters using the material and component level test data. A second phase of the study will include developing full scale FE models of FRP CTMVs and conducting numerical simulations to evaluate their performance.
<p>SCOPE: Volpe is defining the requirements for the material and component level tests to be conducted on FRP materials used in the manufacture of FRP CTMVs. While the test matrix is not fully defined, it is expected to yield material parameters describing static/dynamic anisotropic elasticity, static/dynamic anisotropic strengths, impact strength and toughness, corrosion resistance, durability, fire resistance and/or thermomechanical properties, and performance under fatigue loading. Volpe is reviewing the ASTM FRP test standards, ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and HMR Part 178, Subpart J, among other documents, as a basis for defining the test matrix.</p>
<p>Volpe is seeking responses to this RFI from federal laboratories, academic and research institutions and any consulting firms with the capability and experiences to conduct experimental testing on FRP specimens at the material and component level in any or all of the above defined test categories. Responses to this RFI may address the following items of interest to Volpe: <br /><br /><br />1. Descriptions of your facility, equipment, experience, test capacity and staff preparedness for testing FRP materials and components;<br />2. Descriptions of your familiarity with government and industrial standards on FRP material and component level testing (you are encouraged to submit publications of relevant past work);<br />3. Laboratory hourly rates, technical personnel rates, general facility and equipment usage charges, overhead and other expenses, etc.<br />4. Descriptions of staff/facility/equipment availability ;<br />5. Information on your typical post-test laboratory analyses and report formats, and your ability to tailor report/data formats to customer requirements; <br />6. Recommendations on material and component level test requirements, types of material and component level tests to be conducted, number of repeated tests to establish repeatability, specimen geometry, specimen size, etc.<br />7. Disclosure of your current and past involvement in the design, development, test, evaluation, analysis and/or simulation activities with FRP CTMV manufacturers and/or their representatives is requested for possible conflict of interest considerations.</p>
<p>Volpe will use the information obtained in response to this RFI to guide our development of an FRP material and component test matrix and the subsequent market research and contract development. See related Sources Sought 6913G618RFI0001 regarding FRP specimens from FRP CTMV manufacturers.</p>
<p>Responses to this sources Sought shall be submitted electronically to hailing.yu@dot.gov and peter.wallace@dot.gov or by mail to the address provide below.&nbsp; The information will be used by the Government to develop requirements for a potential upcoming research and test project.</p>
<p>There is no requirement to respond to this Sources Sought in order to be eligible to submit a proposal in response to any formal Request for Proposal (RFP) that may result from this potential project. However, the Government places tremendous value on the information received and may utilize it to finalize its acquisition strategy. Interested small business companies are strongly encouraged fully use this opportunity to describe their capabilities.</p>

<p>Summary of Scope of Work:</p>
<p>McNary Dam has a juvenile salmon bypass system that releases fish through a 36" OD pipe below the dam, approximately 1,200 feet offshore (south shore).  Predatory birds gather at the outfall to capture and eat the exiting fish.  To deter birds from eating fish, a pump and sprinkler system was installed.  The current hazing system for the McNary Juvenile outfall pipe has had a number of problems.  The system has 2 separate configurations and 2 different sprinkler/water cannon configurations all of which have failed completely or have continued maintenance/operational problems.  The goal of this project is to provide a reliable system that prevents the juvenile fish mortality cause by bird predations.</p>
<p>The existing system will be completely removed.  The new system will focus on providing a near continuous curtain of water around and behind the outfall pipe exit.  To accomplish this, a submersible 1000 gpm pump will be installed on the downstream side of pier 24 inside a protective cage and screen.  The 1000 gpm of water from the pump will then be sent to 3 water truck duckbill style nozzles to create a solid curtain of water.  About 60 gpm will be sprayed straight down to keep birds from swimming underneath the outfall pipe to reach18R the fish from behind.</p>
<p>Work will consist of removing the existing system, fabricating a pump cage/screen, fabricating a base for a 1000 lb jib crane, procuring a new pump, , jib crane, piping and nozzles and installing them at the end of the outfall pipe and final pier.  Work will require working off a barge or work platform in deep water in varying amounts of current.  Diving will be required to approximately 10 feet deep.<br /> <br />The contractor will be required to furnish post-award submittals for Government review and acceptance. These submittals may include your mix designs, mechanical packer assembly, project schedule, equipment list, activity hazard analysis, accident prevention plan, AT-OPSEC procedures and employee pre-screening.</p>
<p>All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).</p>
<p>The project will involve the development and management of Contractor furnished submittals for items such as product data, test reports, and contract close-out documentation as required by the technical specifications of the contract.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to use the Government-furnished Resident Management system Contractor Mode (RMS CM) to record, maintain, and submit information throughout the contract period. RMS CM is a Windows-based program that can be run on a stand-alone personal computer or on a network. The Government will make the RMS CM software available to the Contractor after contract award.</p>
<p>The Contractor will be executing this work in close coordination with McNary project staff during concurrent Government operations and maintenance work within and around dam inspection galleries.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">Sources Sought Notice<br /><br />M67854-18-I-1321<br />for<br />Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA<br />Next Generation Handheld Targeting System (NGHTS)<br />formerly known as Future Target System (FTS)<br /><br />NOTE: <br />This Sources Sought Notice engages industry in order to refine the requirement and ensure a competitive acquisition strategy is developed. This is continued market research under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 10, building upon the previously released Request for Information (RFI) M67854-16-I-14164, released in July 2016. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or Request for Quotation (RFQ). <br /><br />Respondents who have previously submitted capability documentation <strong>ARE NOT</strong>required to submit duplicative capability statements, unless new or additional information would like to be conveyed to the Government. All responses to this notice become Government property and will not be returned.<br /><br />The information herein only initiates communication with industry in order to receive feedback and comments from industry on the Program Objectives and DRAFT Performance Specification (PSpec) provided as an attachment to this notice. This notice also communicates potential foci for industry research and development. A goal is to inform industry of the Marine Corps direction regarding this program for its planning purposes. <br /><br />No solicitation document exists at this time. This notice constitutes no Government obligation to procure these items or issue a solicitation. In addition, the Government has no obligation to pay for information or product samples provided in response to this notice and will not accept any responses as offers. Respondents should mark any proprietary information clearly and appropriately. <br /><br />BACKGROUND:<br />Currently the United States Marine Corps (USMC) uses three separate systems to perform rapid target acquisition, laser designation, and laser spot imaging: the Portable Lightweight Designator Rangefinder (PLDR), the Joint Terminal Attack Controller Laser Target Designator (JTAC LTD), and the Thermal Laser Spot Imager (TLSI). These systems are heavy, unwieldy to carry and transport in the field, and contain multiple components. Consequently, there remains a need for a single, lightweight, compact system capable of performing the functionality of these three separate devices while maintaining a form factor that allows the dismounted warfighter to better carry and operate the system during Joint fire support operations. <br /><br />FUTURE CONTRACT AND SCHEDULE:<br />The Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) phase is tentatively scheduled for a 4th Quarter, Fiscal Year 18 release. Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the Next Generation Targeting System (NGHTS) is anticipated for the 4th Quarter of Fiscal Year 22. <br /><br />At this time, the contracting strategy is not finalized, MARCOSYSCOM is considering a two phased approach toward Full Operational Capacity (FOC) - an EMD phase and a Production phase. The EMD phase will potentially result in multiple Cost plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) contracts, and a down select of the EMD contracts will result in Production/Fielding phase Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract. The Government will entertain any potential cost sharing opportunities that can be realized for this effort in the EMD Phase.<br /><br />MARCORSYSCOM anticipates hosting an industry day on March 13 - 14 2018, at University of Mary Washington, Dahlgren Campus, 4224 University Drive, King George, VA 22485. The topic of conversation for the Industry Day will include industry feedback on the anticipated contracting strategy and draft RFP prior to releasing the solicitation. <br />Regarding attendance to the Industry Day only; interested parties may submit their Company name, Cage Code, attendee(s) name, and email address(es) via direct email to tammy.wright@usmc.mil for placement on a direct email list containing additional details. All Industry Day details will be posted on FBO, as well, again in February 2018.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION: <br />MARCORSYSCOM, Ground Combat Element Systems (GCES), Program Manager, Fire Suppression Systems (PM Fires) is requesting industry feedback and comments on the Program Objectives and DRAFT Performance Specification (PSpec) provided as attachments to this notice.<br /><br />PROGRAM OBJECTIVES:<br />The overarching objectives for the NGHTS Program are as follows and will be formally codified in documentation at a later date:<br /><br />- For the Engineering Manufacturing Design Phase, the Contractor shall design, develop, and test a NGHTS prototype in accordance with the DODI 5000.2 and applicable regulations.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only. The 23d Contracting Squadron at Moody AFB (MAFB) is issuing this notice of intent (NOI) to inform industry contractors of the Governments intent to award a Sole Source Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to Retirement Home TV Corporation (RHTV) to provide DirecTV services to Moody AFB Dormitories and Fire Department as a DirecTV 3rd Party Biller. The basis is due to the necessity of ensuring continued support of these services as MAFB is required to observe an existing Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which dictates no breaks in service or MAFB would be in violation of agreement with Local F-118 International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF). The current provider can no longer provide DirecTV services. DirecTV authorized RHTV to be an interim provider in observance to the agreement to prevent a break in service. The Sole Source arrangement is to act as a bridge until requirement is properly competed resulting in an awarded contract. The period of performance will be one (1) year, 1 Jan 2018 - 31 Dec 2018. All inquiries on this action can be submitted in writing (phone calls will not be accepted) by email to victor.houston.1@us.af.mil NO LATER THAN 20 Dec 2017 @ 9:00 AM E.S.T. The point of contact for this requirement is Mr. Victor Houston. This is not a request for quotes and does NOT constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this Special Notice will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions.

<DESC>Traditional inspection methods for materials and outer mold line (OML) coatings on bomber aircraft require a significant man-hour burden and are prone to reporting errors due to insufficient, labor-intensive nature of the baseline inspection processes.  As the B-2 ages, sustainment and health assessment of its' material systems becomes increasingly difficult.  An automated capability for inspecting the health of the OML coatings in a fast and accurate manner is needed to be demonstrated at a technology readiness level (TRL) 6/7 on aircraft within 3-5 years to ensure the B-2 fleet is reliably maintained and mission-ready.  Additionally, reliable and accurate capabilities are needed to ensure material systems meet required sub-system and/or component specifications. The sustainment activities, equipment, and processes for these aircraft and materials are the responsibility of the aircraft original equipment manufacturer (OEM).  As such, any modernization or improvements must be integrated and adopted by the OEM.  Detailed knowledge of the aircraft system performance and material specifications are required in order to successfully develop and transition optimized inspection capabilities for the B-2 program.  The inspection capability must be able to complete a 100% assessment of the surface material state and seamlessly report inspection results into existing assessment databases.  Automated inspections must be able to detect any surface material defects and damage (to include, but not limited to, cracked or missing material).  In addition, capturing the location and orientation of the defect or insufficiency is also critically important to fully characterize the damage.  The program goal for total aircraft inspection time, processing and database population is 30 minutes.
<p>Developing and transitioning technical solutions from non-OEMs with limited program data rights and access to aircraft and knowledge databases will compound high performance, cost, and schedule risk to the current OEM's contractual responsibility to sustain B-2 aircraft.</p>

<DESC>1.0	Purpose &amp; Background
<p>Call number W911W6-17-R-0009, Future Embedded Rotorcraft Sustainment Technologies (FERST) Program, solicits proposals for 6.3 Advanced Technology Development.  The Future Embedded Rotorcraft Sustainment Technologies (FERST) program will demonstrate the ability of the aircraft to autonomously respond to the overall health of the aircraft.  The Army's aviation sustainment goals are to improve aircraft operational availability (Ao), reduce operations and support (O&amp;S) costs, and minimize the logistics footprint. The Army's Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program has Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) as a performance goal, to include simultaneous monitoring, acquisition, storage, and processing of aircraft data (structural, engine, drive train, and electronic) and aircrew voice interchanges, with condition and health indicators, and tolerance monitoring in flight.  FVL goals also include the ability to autonomously provide data to maintenance personnel and to download/track status during flight.  The shift from time-based maintenance toward CBM with a Zero-Maintenance emphasis is focused on analysis of aircraft health and usage data to assess the present and projected condition of the aircraft to determine when maintenance is absolutely required.  An Army S&amp;T goal is to develop technologies that provide aviation platforms the ability to accurately assess health and project failure of critical aircraft components, based on actual usage in operational environments.  This effort is not intended to develop a new Adaptive Vehicle Management system but to take advantage of the extensive work that has already been done in this area.</p>
<p>Past applied research and advanced technology development efforts have focused on developing, maturing, and demonstrating individual autonomous diagnostic, prognostic, and system health assessment technologies such as:  <br />&bull;	Aircraft Level Reasoner (COST-A)<br />&bull;	Auto Track and Balance (ASTRO)<br />&bull;	Virtual Bus and Power Line Communication (OSST-II, ASTRO)<br />&bull;	Smart LRU's (OSST-II, COST-A, ASTRO)<br />&bull;	Solid State Power Distribution (ASTRO)<br />&bull;	Automated Power Assurance and Engine Health (OSTT-II, COST-A, ASTRO)<br />&bull;	Adaptive Vehicle Management System (AVMS)<br />&bull;	Fly-by-Wire / Full Authority (JMR-TD, AVMS)</p>
<p>These efforts have provided a capability to know the current health state of aircraft components and the general configuration of the aircraft. They have also in some cases provided the sub-systems or components with the ability to adapt based on their health. The FERST program seeks to build upon past efforts by integrating, at the aircraft system level, autonomous sustainment technologies that allow informed, intelligently determined, real-time comprehensive system control, mission planning and an overall maintenance philosophy based on actual aircraft health and usage.  This will ensure aircraft reliability and availability while taking advantage of ultra-durable, adaptable, and damage tolerant systems.</p>
<p>The Army's Aviation Development Directorate is soliciting FERST proposals for the development, maturation, and demonstration of integrated health management technologies (encompassing Engines, Drives, Structures, VMS, Electrical, and Rotors Systems)  thus enabling the aircraft to autonomously respond to the overall health of the aircraft.  Vehicle self-assessment technologies, including usage and component tracking, that provide real-time health information to an integrated aircraft adaptive control system (ACS) that adjusts the aircraft control logic based on overall current and projected vehicle health are key elements of this effort.  FERST offers the potential to reduce usage based damage and mitigate environmental and combat induced damage, by cueing the pilot before entering a damaging regime.  The part history and aircraft configuration management capabilities provided by FERST should further reduce the current sustainment burden associated with tasks such as historical record keeping and part ordering.  This program will increase time on wing and maintenance free operational periods, resulting in increased Ao, decreased O&amp;S Costs, and a reduced logistics footprint for Army aircraft; while also enabling an increased based capability that will lead to fully integrated adaptive controls as envisioned for a Zero Maintenance Aircraft. <br /> Additional instruction and information can be found under the Master Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) W911W6-16-R-0003 which is posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov.</p>
<p>2.0	Scope of Research Effort</p>
<p>2.1	Background<br />The Aviation Development Directorate is soliciting technical and cost proposals to accomplish the FERST program.  Starting Technology Readiness Level (TRL)  of individual technologies may be as low as TRL 4. Technologies and the integrated solution are expected to be matured to a TRL 6 under this advanced technology development effort.  <br />Offerors may submit multiple proposals.  Each proposal shall describe an effort to address all of the requirements defined within the performance objectives and technical constraints.  Offerors shall describe in their proposal a clear path to transition the proposed solution to future aircraft and where applicable to current Army aircraft.  Offerors shall also describe and substantiate the anticipated operations and support benefits of their proposed integrated solution. Offerors are strongly encouraged to take advantage of currently available technologies (sensors, algorithms, etc.) and existing aircraft data sources wherever possible.  Demonstration testing shall be full-scale and representative of the expected aircraft operating environment and be of sufficient scope to demonstrate the capability, accuracy and robustness of the technologies.  An integrated, aircraft flight test demonstration is required. Although FERST is not a fielding effort, Offerors should consider qualification requirements in the design and when proposing a technical approach (e.g., ADS-79E, MIL-STD-810G for system durability, MIL-STD-461F as modified by ADS-37A-PRF for EMI, MIL-STD-704F for aircraft power compatibility, ADS-89-SP for structural integrity latest revision, DO-178C for software,  and DO-254 for hardware).  FERST is intended to utilize an Open Systems Architecture (OSA) approach that integrates business and technical practices to create systems with interoperable and reusable components based on using modular design, standards-based interfaces, and widely-supported open standards.  Offerors shall address OSA in the transition plan and considerations should be made for alignment with the Army's Joint Common Architecture (JCA) Functional Reference Architecture and conformance to the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACETM) Technical Standard.  Program efforts shall identify the requirements to qualify and transition the technology to the field.<br />2.2	Performance Objectives and Technical Constraints</p>
<p>The goal of the FERST program is to increase Ao by optimizing aircraft performance, component remaining useful life, and maintenance based on aircraft health and usage.  The objective of this program is to demonstrate an intelligent aircraft system that provides the ability for the aircraft to safely and autonomously respond to the overall health through a comprehensive (Engines, Drives, Structures, VMS, Electrical, Avionics, and Rotors Systems) integrated solution.  The FERST program shall develop, mature and integrate sustainment technologies that support and feed adaptive controls, mission execution, and mission planning based on aircraft health and usage.  FERST will demonstrate, real-time in-flight, automated methods to sense aircraft and system-level health, make adjustments, and predict remaining useful life. Key focus areas include, but are not limited to, all functions and operations of an overall adaptive vehicle management system, system self-assessment (remaining useful life (RUL), prognostics and diagnostics, usage tracking, and embedded aircraft/component history), onboard and off-board configuration management and parts management, and the ability to interface/export data to other supporting off-board systems (Maintenance, Logistics, Fleet Management, etc...).  The FERST program shall provide onboard embedded configuration and parts management to facilitate Ao and O&amp;S decision making tasks.  Since FVL is identified as the primary transition target, Offerors are encouraged to take advantage of the clean sheet design and maintenance opportunity and not be constrained by conventional practices.   <br />FERST shall:</p>
<p>&bull;	Develop, mature, and integrate the health assessment and  adaptive systems required to enable an integrated aircraft adaptive control system to safely and autonomously respond to overall aircraft health <br />&bull;	Provide onboard aircraft embedded configuration and parts management<br />&bull;	Utilize an open system architecture and common data standards<br />&bull;	Demonstrate the integrated solution to TRL 6 upon completion of the effort<br />o	Provide Real-time automated health assessment (RUL/usage tracking/diagnostic and prognostic data etc.)<br />o	Provide cognitive decision aiding to the pilot about possible damaging regimes based on health<br />o	Final demonstration desired on aircraft<br />&bull;	Develop a Transition Plan</p>
<p>FERST shall utilize integrated adaptive technologies capable of providing information and adjustments to the aircraft during in-flight operations and mission execution, to maximize aircraft performance based upon overall aircraft health.  At a minimum, Offerors shall consider the following aircraft, sub-system, and component critical areas: <br /> <br />&bull;	State Awareness <br />&bull;	Baseline Control Logic<br />&bull;	Historical Information<br />&bull;	RUL Based on Usage<br />&bull;	Health State Change<br />&bull;	Autonomous System/Component Adjustments Available</p>
<p>Required development, maturation, and integration must be addressed for solutions leveraging existing technologies such as:</p>
<p><br />&bull;	Aircraft Level Reasoner<br />&bull;	Auto Track and Balance<br />&bull;	Virtual Bus and Power Line Communication<br />&bull;	Smart LRU's<br />&bull;	Solid State Power Distribution<br />&bull;	Automated Power Assurance and Engine Health<br />&bull;	Adaptive Vehicle Management System<br />&bull;	Fly-by-Wire / Full Authority Solutions<br />&bull;	Virtual Sensors/Monitoring</p>
<p>Offerors shall indicate the entering TRL of each of the proposed technologies and describe the technical approach to achieve a TRL 6 for the integrated system by the completion of the effort.  Offerors shall start with the air vehicle as the starting level Work Breakdown Structures  (WBS) and go down to the component level or three levels down, whichever is more detailed, in describing and detailing the work required to show how the work progresses from the component level up to the aircraft level. The system shall utilize all available information/data across all subsystems and react to real-time changes in: vehicle health (system/subsystem/component), flight conditions, platform /mission equipment package (MEP), subsystem, damage, etc. Due to the impact the system will have on the flight worthiness of the aircraft, the system shall function in real-time as a cohesive and collaborative system.  The system shall also have an override that reverts the aircraft back to a normal predefined flight control logic.  FERST shall enable integrated adaptive aircraft systems capable of providing information and adjustments to the aircraft in-flight operation and mission execution that adapt to aircraft health.  Pilot cueing will allow the pilot to effectively manage changes to mission and maneuvers; damage, failure, or degradation of components; vehicle state or configuration; and environment.</p>
<p>FERST shall provide embedded configuration and parts management by serial number down to the component/LRU level where applicable.  The monitored components shall automatically record and store the pertinent data (i.e., part number, serial number, time on wing, flight hours, usage, maintenance actions, RUL, and additional DA Form 2410, Component Removal and<br />Repair/Overhaul Record, data) and transmit the required information for onboard processing and use, and provide the interfaces required to pass or export the information to ground-based maintenance, logistics, and fleet management systems (Enterprise solutions ex. Global Combat Support System-Army (GCSS-A), Logistics Modernization Program (LMP) , etc.)  FERST data exported off the aircraft shall be limited by performing preprocessing on sensors, in an onboard processing unit, and/or on smart components (ex: parametric, health, historical, maintenance), or other methods to enable real-time response.  Raw data shall be available on the aircraft for a specified number of flight hours (ex: 50 FH) for event and schedule driven data collection (i.e., aircraft incident, product improvement). RUL shall be in a quantitative format based on usage (ex: damage fraction, predicted remaining flight hours based on usage and health, etc...).</p>
<p>The FERST demonstration testing shall be a full scale on aircraft flight demonstration and representative of the expected aircraft operating environment and be of sufficient scope to demonstrate the capability, accuracy and robustness of the integrated system.  Offerors shall justify how the proposed testing meets TRL 6.</p>
<p>FERST offerors shall use an open system architecture and common data standards.  Offerors are also advised to keep JCA and FACE conformance in mind when developing their proposals, as these are prospective methodologies for FVL. FERST is intended to utilize an Open Systems Architecture (OSA) approach that integrates business and technical practices to create systems with interoperable and reusable components based on using modular design, standards-based interfaces, and widely-supported open standards.  Offerors shall address OSA in the transition plan and considerations should be made for alignment with the Army's Joint Common Architecture (JCA) Functional Reference Architecture and conformance to the Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACETM) Technical.  Offers shall identify and substantiate proposed common data standards in their proposal.</p>
<p>FERST offerors shall provide a Transition Plan as a deliverable under this effort.  Offerors shall address the transition of the technology to FVL platforms and insertion of high payoff capabilities into the current fleet.  Program efforts shall identify the requirements to qualify and transition the technology to the field.   Offer shall consider potential changes to safety and qualification practices that these technologies may facilitate or require for fielding.  The Transition Plan shall also include data verification for certification efforts and cybersecurity for methodologies utilized in the effort and proposed in the plan. The FERST Transition Plan shall include critical enabling technologies development strategies as well as provide justification for estimated cost and overall operational benefits (Ao, O&amp;S cost, and logistics footprint).  <br />Offeror shall use the following metrics:</p>
<p>&bull;	Ao = MTBM/ (MTBM + MMT + MLDT) = 90% (Threshold) / 95% (Objective)</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p>MTBM is Mean Time Between Maintenance</p>
<p>MMT   is Mean Maintenance Time</p>
<p>MLDT is Mean Logistics Delay Time</p>
<p>Ao for this effort is for a Battalion level fleet.  Offerors shall detail how they achieved the desired Ao in terms of the formula provided above, providing sufficient detail so the benefits can be traced back to a specific technology, system, or process improvement.</p>
<p>&bull;	O&amp;S Costs = (Most Current FY available for Medium Lift Aircraft)*75% with an allowable 2% inflation rate for 20 year.</p>
<p>&bull;	Logistics Footprint &lt;= (Most Current FY available for Medium Lift Aircraft) Personnel and Equipment, Aircraft Ground Support Equipment (AGSE) (Aircraft Specific and Common), and Parts and Spares</p>
<p>Offerors are strongly encouraged to take advantage of previously developed and demonstrated technologies wherever possible.</p>
<p>This effort shall define system level design concepts which support the capabilities desired for a FVL aircraft.  Offerors shall perform tradeoffs, quantify/substantiate improvements, conduct proof-concept demonstrations (where applicable), and describe a clear path for technology development, maturation, and integration for each concept and/or component to a TRL 6 by 2022, including a development, maturation, and integration strategy for critical enabling technologies.  Key considerations include performance, operational suitability, volumetric power density SWaP (size, weight, and power), reliability, safety, scalability, affordability, risks, and maintenance requirements.</p>

<p>Background:</p>
<p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) &nbsp;is responsible for research on living marine resources in the coastal oceans off Alaska. The mission of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center is to plan, develop, and manage scientific research programs which generate the best scientific data available for understanding, managing, and conserving the region's living marine resources.</p>
<p>AFSC scientists compile and analyze broad databases on fishery, oceanography, marine mammal, and environmental research. These data are used to develop policies and strategies for fisheries management within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, monitor and assess the health of the region's marine mammal populations, and develop the scientific understanding and predictive methodologies needed to implement NOAA Fisheries' ecosystem approach to management. Research programs at the AFSC are managed and conducted through the Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE), Resource Ecology and Fisheries Management Division (REFM), National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Fisheries Monitoring and Analysis Division (FMA), and Auke Bay Laboratory.</p>
<p>AFSC scientists work aboard NOAA vessels and commercial fishing vessels that are chartered to conduct the survey operations. During any given year, RACE deploys science crew aboard a combination of as many as six NOAA and charter vessels simultaneously during the survey season. All fishing operations conform to established AFSC standard operating protocols to ensure (1) scientific consistency and (2) statistical continuity of the time series used to reliably monitor the status and forecast the trends of fish and crab populations.</p>
<p>In 2013 NMFS restructured the North Pacific Observer Program (Observer Program) thereby expanding the vessels subject to observer coverage to include groundfish vessels less than 60 ft in length overall (LOA) and halibut vessels that had not been previously required to carry an observer. Expanding observer coverage to the approximately 950 previously unobserved vessels improved NMFS' ability to estimate total catch in all Federal fisheries in the North Pacific.</p>
<p>Many vessel owners and operators are opposed to carrying an observer. Vessel owners and operators have voiced their concerns to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council and NMFS stating that with the expanded observer program, there is limited space on board for an additional person or limited space in the vessel's life raft. Some vessel owners, operators, and industry representatives, particularly those active in fixed gear fisheries (i.e., hook-and-line and pot fisheries) have advocated for the use of electronic monitoring (EM) of fishing activity instead of having an observer on board their vessels.</p>
<p>To address these concerns, the Council and NMFS have been actively engaged in developing EM as a tool to collect imagery and sensor information that would be processed to extract data necessary to estimate total catch in the fixed gear fisheries. Over the past several years, NMFS and industry participants have undertaken cooperative research to test the applicability and reliability of readily available "off-the-shelf" EM systems. An EM system uses cameras, video storage devices, and associated sensors to record and monitor fishing activities. Through a final rule published in September 2017 (final rule citation when available), NMFS intends to integrate EM into the Observer Program beginning January 1, 2018 and to begin collecting data for catch accounting using EM.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>NOAA/NMFS is seeking public comment on the two draft Performance Work Statements (PWS) that are attached to this notice. A comment sheet has been provided to submit comments. These comments will be considered as NOAA/NMFS further refines its requirements.</p>
<p>NOAA/NMFS has not decided whether or not these two requirements will be made into one requirement or kept as two separate requirements. Feedback on this particular issue is also being sought at this time.&nbsp;<br /><br />Submittal Requirements:</p>
<p>Please submit your response via email with the excel document to the attention of Noah Nielsen, Contracting Officer, (noah.nielsen@noaa.gov) no later than September 15, 2017 at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.</p>

Some bolt holes may be smaller than the bolt specified on the drawings. Reaming of the bolts holes may be required to obtain a body bound condition.</p>
<p>2.2.2 ELECTRICAL WIRING: Installation of all electrical wiring, conduit, and components shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of NFPA 70. As a minimum the following shall be followed:</p>
<p>&bull; All electrical connections shall be installed in accordance with NFPA 70 sections 110.14 or 430.9, as applicable, or as recommended by the device manufacturer.</p>
<p>&bull; Crimped terminal lugs, if used, shall be properly sized for the wire and installed using the device(s) - e.g., crimping tool and indenter - recommended by the terminal lug manufacturer.</p>
<p>&bull; All spare conductors shall be identified as spare conductors, and shall have their ends insulated to preclude accidental contact with energized equipment.</p>
<p>&bull; Adhesive-backed wiring tie wraps and cable-clamping devices shall not be used when mounting to control panel backplanes unless they are secured with fasteners, in addition to the adhesive. In other locations, use of adhesive-back wiring tie wraps and cable-clamping devices should be minimized as much as practical.</p>
<p>&bull; Wiring around sharp edges, such as panel doors, shall be wrapped in protective sleeves (e.g., "spiral wrap") to prevent wiring insulation damage from chaffing, cutting, or abrasion.</p>
<p>&bull; Control panels shall not be used as raceways for conductors not terminating within the panel.</p>
<p>&bull; Bushings or chafing protection gear shall be used on all panel conduit entries.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) intends to award a fixed-price purchase order on a single source basis to Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC, 7400 South Alton Court, Englewood, CO, 80112-2395, for enterprise-wide license to obtain, use and store CUSIP data, including CUSIP numbers and descriptions, in electronic format. The CUSIP system is a standard numbering and descriptive methodology utilized throughout the financial community for identifying securities. The Contracting Officer has determined that Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC is the only source that can reasonably meet the SEC's requirement in accordance with FAR Part 13.106-1(b) because Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC is the only known source that allows the user to license access directly with them in order to store CUSIP data within their own systems. In addition, the SEC requires access to the data via a specific platform, for which a license direct with Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC is required.
<p>The SEC intends to award a purchase order to Standard &amp; Poor's Financial Services, LLC on or about December 26, 2017. The period of performance of the purchase order is anticipated to be 12 months. The total award value will be below the Simplified Acquisition Threshold.</p>
<p>This notice is not a competitive request for proposals. A competitive solicitation will not be issued.

Project Description

VA has a requirement to develop approximately 27,000 gravesites as the next phase of the National Cemetery.  The Design-Build/Contractor (D/B) shall provide all labor, material, supervision, equipment, travel and performance of work in accordance with this Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the awarded contract.  All Architect/Engineer (A/E) Services required in this RFP shall be performed by licensed Architects and Engineers registered in the State/Territory/Other of this project.  

In accordance with the master plan that was prepared for the entire cemetery, this Gravesite Expansion & Cemetery Improvements project will develop approximately 35 acres of the undeveloped 443 acres remaining at the Calverton National Cemetery.  This project will utilize national cemetery design criteria specified within documents including the VA program Guide (PG-18-15, Volume D), A/E Submission Instructions for National Cemetery Projects, as well as the National Cemetery Administration (NCA) Facilities Design Guide and other bridging documents. 

This project is the next in a series of successive 10-year construction phased projects into undeveloped acreage remaining within the confines of Calverton National Cemetery.  Additional undeveloped land will be developed in future 10-year phased projects.  Since this is an existing cemetery, only those facilities and infrastructure necessary to support the added maintenance, operation, and providing projected burials for approximately ten years will comprise this phase of construction.  Also included in this project will be repairs, renovations to the Administration-PIC Building, Maintenance Complex, Committal Shelter area, road system, landscaping, and general cemetery appearance.  The Honor Guard temporary trailer will be replaced by a nominal Honor Guard Building attached to the Committal Hub Building.  Deteriorated structures and asphalt pavement will be removed at the 25A area and this area graded and restored to future burial area.  Approximately 35 acres of land will be consumed and approximately 27,000 gravesites, both full-casket and cremain sites will be developed with this investment as well as an evaluation of the existing structures and accomplish and retrofit/incorporate Guiding Principles for High Performance and Sustainable Buildings MOU and Renewable Energy Initiatives as required.  This project will also involve a major evaluation and modernization of the existing cemetery irrigation system as well as expansion into the new burial sections developed by this project.  Additionally, FCA condition D or F corrections will be incorporated onto this project, including road repairs and upgrades, as necessary.

The approximate project duration will be 1,274 calendar days from the Notice to Proceed.  The estimated magnitude for this project is between $20,000,000 and $50,000,000.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) with the size standard of $36.5 Million.

CFM intends to conduct this acquisition in accordance with Subpart 36.3, Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures.

<p><strong>PROPOSAL DUE DATE AND TIME:</strong> This BAA will remain open for a period of FOUR (4)&nbsp;years from the date of publication. NO PROPOSALS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AGAINST THIS OVERARCHING BAA. Proposal due dates and times will be specified in CALLs published separately from the overarching announcement. Proposals received after the due date and time specified in the CALL shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). It should be noted that this installation observes strict security procedures to enter the facility. These security procedures are NOT considered an interruption of normal Government processes, and proposals received after the above stated date and time as a result of security delays will be considered "late".</p>
<p>Note: If offerors use commercial carriers for delivery of proposals, carriers may not honor time-of-day delivery guarantees on military installations. Early proposal submission is encouraged. <br />__________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><strong>BRIEF PROGRAM SUMMARY:</strong> The Vanguard Center (formerly known as Maui High Performance Computing Center MHPCC) is one of five Defense Supercomputing Resource Centers (DSRCs) for the Department of Defense (DoD) High Performance Computing Modernization Program (HPCMP). It provides advanced, high-performance computing tools based on the latest technologies to Government researchers. The mission of the Vanguard Center is to evaluate and optimize early-production HPC technology and provide breakthrough software solutions to significantly increase the breadth and impact of the HPCMP.</p>
<p>The strategic focus areas of the Vanguard Center are: <br />- Exploring and evaluating emerging HPC architectures and technologies<br />- Developing breakthrough, HPC-backed solutions for high priority DoD use cases<br />- Lowering barriers to high productivity computing by creating a modern HPC ecosystem</p>
<p>In addition to the HPCMP-focused mission, the Vanguard Center contributes to the AFRL modeling, simulation, and data analytics (MS&amp;A) enterprise which may include supporting real time, physics-based campaign level as well as space situational analyses. The Vanguard Center also plans to demonstrate high impact HPC integration and federation to address DoD needs in the Pacific Theater.</p>
<p><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION:</strong> This BAA is issued pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 6.102(d)(2) - Use of Competitive Procedures, which provides for the competitive selection of research proposals. Proposals submitted in response to this BAA and selected for award are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of PL 98-369, the Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984. Offerors MUST monitor http://www.fbo.gov in the event this announcement is amended and for the posting of CALLs.</p>
<p><strong>CALLS:</strong> A CALL is a required posting, issued through FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov), soliciting a specific/targeted response and/or proposal for specific research efforts. A CALL will contain a specific description of the research effort to be addressed, the anticipated period of performance, and any other information particular to the specific requested effort. CALLs are published independently at various times during the open period of the BAA and may use either a One-Step or Two-Step process. A CALL issued against the BAA will specify either a direct request for a technical and cost/business proposal, or a white paper submission as a means to determine if a proposal will be required.</p>
<p><strong>TYPE OF CONTRACTS/INSTRUMENTS:</strong> The Air Force reserves the right to award the instrument best suited to the nature of the research proposed. The Government anticipates a mix of contract types and other instruments will be used throughout the life of this BAA. Generally, awards under this BAA may be cost plus fixed fee (completion and term), cost contract, firm fixed price, other transaction authority, technology investment agreements, grants, or cooperative agreements. Calls will be posted on www.grants.gov.</p>
<p>Cost type contracts will require successful offerors to have an accounting system deemed adequate by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for tracking costs under a cost reimbursable contract (DFARS 242.75). If an offeror does NOT have a DCAA-approved accounting system, a Cost plus Fixed Fee and Cost Contract cannot be awarded.</p>
<p><strong>ANTICIPATED NUMBER OF AWARDS:</strong> The Air Force anticipates awarding a minimum of one contract per specific CALL. However, the Air Force does reserve the right to make multiple awards or no awards pursuant to a CALL.</p>

<DESC>**Notification was posted on FBO utilizing solicitation number W31P4Q-17-R-0041 on 15 Aug 17 requesting all potential bidders to notify the US Government of their intent to participate in the Sentinel A4 procurement NLT COB 25 Aug 17. Further information will be sent only to those potential bidders who responded with such notice. As of 26 Aug 17, no further solicitation documentation will be placed on FBO, per the national security exception to posting in FAR 5.202(a)(1).**
<p>This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. No contract will be awarded as a result of this Synopsis. The purpose of this synopsis is to inform industry that the US Army has a requirement for the modification of the Sentinel A3 radar (AN/MPQQ-64A3).</p>
<p>The Government has a requirement to modify the Sentinel A3 radar (AN/MPQ-64A3). The current Sentinel radar fills a unique position in the air and missile defense architecture not met by any other existing sensor. The Sentinel A3 is approaching obsolescence end-of-life on several components, and the current configuration cannot meet all performance requirements against projected future threats. To address these concerns, the Government will modify the Sentinel A3 with new radar antenna technologies.</p>
<p>The resulting modification, the Sentinel A4 (AN/MPQ-64A4), is a three-dimensional X-band phased array radar system equipped to support beyond visual range air defense engagements. The Sentinel A4 will provide new antenna components to add detection, classification, identification, and reporting capability against Rocket, Artillery, and Mortar (RAM) threats to support the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2-Intercept Block 2 mission while addressing current Sentinel A3 obsolescence issues and improving existing Sentinel capability against Cruise Missile (CM), Unmanned Aerial System (UAS), rotary wing, and fixed wing threats.</p>
<p>As a new acquisition, the Government will use a competitive procurement for this effort. The Sentinel A4 development includes Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD), Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP), and fielding to the First Unit Equipped (FUE). EMD will begin at contract award. The LRIP and FUE will be contract options. The Sentinel A4 development effort includes all engineering, program management, test and evaluation, training, and technical data needed to support a Full Rate Production (FRP) decision. The estimated period of performance (POP) for this contract requirement is 1 Jun 2019 through 30 September 2025.</p>

registered in that NAICS prior to receipt of quote in order to receive an
award. Offeror are reminded that failure to comply shall render their quote
as non-responsive.<BR><BR>Fedbid is a mechanism used by this office to solicit for common use
commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil. Packages sent Federal Express or UPS should be addressed to: HQ Army Material Command
Office of Command Counsel 9301 Chapek Rd, Rm 2-1SE3401 Ft Belvoir, VA
22060-5527. The AMC-Level Protest procedures are found at:
http://www.amc.army.mil/pa/COMMANDCOUNSEL.asp. If internet access is not

<p><strong>Security Clearance<br /></strong>Performance of this contract will require routine access by employees of the Contractor or its subcontractors to facilities or systems controlled by the IHS (Indian Health Service). Before starting work requiring routine access to IHS facilities or systems each person must complete an FBI National Criminal History Check (Fingerprint Check) adjudicated by an IHS employee using the Office of Personnel Management Personnel Investigations Processing System. Contractors shall allow five business days for IHS processing of fingerprints taken electronically at an IHS site and thirty business days for non-electronic processing of fingerprints using FBI Form FD-258. A list of IHS sites with electronic fingerprint capability is available from the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The IHS utilizes the eQIP (Electronic Questionnaire Investigations Processing) system to process background investigations. Contractors are required to work with the Service Unit Background Coordinator or other designee to properly complete their eQIP entry without error. Proper submission of the eQIP entry to the OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is required prior to the individual being allowed to begin their performance under this contract.

<p><strong>OIG Exclusion List<br /></strong>No contract award shall be made to a vendor or provider listed on the OIG Exclusion List (http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov) throughout the duration of the contract.

<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the LEIE (HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov.

During the performance, the Contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer the names of any additional or substitute employees for screening before they begin work.</p>
<p>The Contractor is responsible for conducting security preclearance investigations in sufficient depth to ensure that each Contractor or subcontractor employee referred to IHS is not on the LEIE and can obtain a favorable fingerprint clearance. Each security preclearance shall be conducted sufficiently in advance of the start of performance to avoid delays caused by denial of access. If this is a Time and Materials, Labor-Hour, or Cost-Reimbursement contract, the contractor shall not charge for or be reimbursed for labor hours or other costs incurred for employees who are unable to perform due to denial or access or the excess time required to resolve and clear unfavorable security clearance findings. If this is a Fixed-Price contract, denial of access due to security clearance findings shall not be a basis for excusable delay or an increase to the contract amount.</p>
<p>The Government will pay for the cost to process the contractor's suitability clearances. However, multiple investigations for the same position may, at the Contracting Officer's discretion, lead to a reduction(s) in the contract price of no more than the cost of the investigation(s).</p>

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Postgraduate School Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering has an immediate requirement for an over of an existing Allison T63 turboshaft engine. A sole source justification for Aeromaritime America is provided.  

The engine is essential to the Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering with regard to instruction and research, especially in supporting thesis work, core requirements in order for NPS to fulfill its mission.  It offers a critical tool for student understanding of chemical to mechanical energy conversion principles.  To that end, having the unit overhauled will provide a safe and reliable platform for years to come.  The cost of having a turboshaft engine overhauled is very expensive so minimizing cost was a priority.
  Aeromaritime America has been very flexible in helping to work with us in developing a plan that would significantly reduce costs to make the overhaul affordable.  Over a period of three weeks, a lot of effort was expended in developing a plan that deviates significantly from the typical overhaul process.  Some of theses unique requirements include the fact that the engine does not require flight certification.  In addition, if some of the required parts on the engine are deemed unserviceable, Aeromaritime America has indicated that they will find parts that are serviceable but not necessarily flight certified, which is extraordinary as all aircraft engine service centers deal only with flight certified hardware; hardware deemed not being able to be certified for flight is destroyed.
  In addition, the test run procedures that determine output performance will be modified so that not all procedural requirements and inspections will be done which is normally the case for flight certification.  Aeromaritime America is expending a lot of effort providing these compromises to its normal procedures to accommodate us which will result in significant cost savings to the government.  In return, the government, specifically the Dept.of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, will receive an engine that will support its requirements for years to come.

(1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples.
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK

1. Description of Services:  The Contractor shall provide all management, licenses, laboratory testing, tools, supplies, equipment, transportation and labor to develop and implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) plan at the James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center in North Chicago, IL in a manner that will ensure the health and general well-being of patients, staff, and visitors.  Services at the Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) are only to remedy those insects brought in by patients and include, but are not limited to: Bedbugs, Scabies, Lice, Roaches, Fleas, etc., on an individual on-call basis.  IPM for the CBOC buildings is the responsibility of the Building Manager and is not included in this contract.  IPM is a process for achieving long term, environmentally sound pest suppression through the use of a wide variety of technological and management practices.  Control strategies in an IPM Program extend beyond the application of pesticides to include structural and procedural modifications that reduce the food, water, harborage, and access used by pests.  The following types of pests are common on this campus, and their abatement should be specifically addressed in the IPM and used to determine workload:

ANTS, ARACHNIDS, ROACHES, BEDBUGS, WATERBUGS, SILVERFISH, BEETLES, FLEAS, MOSQUITOES, CHIGGERS, FLIES, MOTHS, SCABIES, LICE OR OTHER INSECTS: MICE, GOPHERS, RACCOON, FOX, RATS, SKUNKS AND OTHER RODENTS, ALL BIRDS AND WATERFOWL.

Contractor shall also be responsible for the control of pigeons.  This control may entail the use of traps/cages and live bait.  Cages must be equipped with adequate food and water to sustain entrapped pigeons until removal by the Contractor.  Removal shall occur at frequent intervals and the number of pigeons removed shall be reported to the Contracting Officer s Representative (COR).  Contractor will insure that they obtain appropriate Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) permit for the destruction of Canada goose nests and eggs.  

It shall be the Contractor s responsibility to remove and properly dispose of bee and wasp nests, and all birds and animals trapped/caught within the property of North Chicago FHCC.

1.1     Basic Services:  The contractor shall develop an IPM plan for approval.  The IPM plan will require approval by the Contractor s Technical Representative, COR prior to implementation and is subject to the COR and Contracting Officer s (CO) approval.  The Contractor s IPM plan shall establish the strategy and methods for conducting a safe, effective, and environmentally sound pest management program.  Prospective contractors may review the installation s historical records of pest activity and abatement actions, and survey facilities and grounds in order to develop a pest management plan.  In developing the IPM plan, the contractor should address continuous monitoring, pest response and removal procedures, record keeping, warranties, pest education and communication to hospital personnel to prevent pests and disease vectors, and to initiate bird control around the campus.  The IPM approach should use targeted methods including habitat/facility modification, biological/genetic/cultural control, mechanical/physical control, and where necessary, the judicious use of least hazardous pesticides.  The IPM plan shall comply with all applicable Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and state/local regulatory guidance on pesticide storage, disposal and applications. Contractor shall submit their IPM plan for approval with the signed offer.   IPM services plan required of the contractor shall include, but not be limited to the following tasks:

<a href="mailto:Patricia.Newberry@va.gov">Contrat Specialist</a>
<DESC>The US Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 1, Northampton VA Medical Center located at 421 North Main Street, Leeds, MA 01053 is seeking a contractor to provide an estimated 12,000 gallons of No. 2 Heating Oil for Residential Quarters and 8350 gallons of ULSD fuel for generators and boiler plant operation at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Central Western Massachusetts (VACWM), in Leeds, MA, for the period one year from date of contract.
  This solicitation is set aside for Service Disable, Veteran Owned Small business.
STATEMENT OF WORK: 

Provide an estimated 12,000 gallons of No. 2 Heating Oil for Residential Quarters and 8350 gallons of ULSD
fuel for generators and boiler plant operation at the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Central Western
Massachusetts (VACWM), in Leeds, MA, for the period one year from date of contract. The supplier shall
calculate heating degree days to schedule fuel deliveries but will also be available on a will-call/as-needed
basis for emergencies or extremely cold periods when higher fuel consumption could affect calculated heating
degree days. The agency has an internal policy to provide its tenants a 3-day notification for planned
deliveries. We generally make these notifications on Fridays for delivery the following week. Planned
deliveries shall be on Tuesday mornings starting at 8:30 AM EST. All fuel deliveries (except emergencies) have to end by 3 PM EST to prevent overtime expenses by the agency.

Deliveries are to the following locations: 
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 17 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 18 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 19 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 21 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 22 - two (2) 275 Gallon tanks (both tanks are next to each other in the garage and the fill pipes are within arm s reach of each other   no truck repositioning is required) 
VAMC, 421 N Main St, Leeds, MA   Quarters 23 A & B   one (1) 275 Gallon tank per side = 2 tanks

Most residential quarters above have 1 tank on each side of the building except Qtrs 22.  This will require re-positioning labor of the hose or truck at each building in order to make the deliveries.  Local points of contact for deliveries are Tony Methot at (413)584-4040 ext 2222 or Ron Shepard at (413)584-4040 ext 2211. 

Special Requirements: 
A certification from the fuel supplier is required for each shipment to include: 
1. Name of fuel supplier 
2. Date of delivery 
3. Volume of fuel delivered in shipment per location.
4. Either separate invoice for each tank or a breakdown by tank on one invoice 
5. Sulfur content of the delivered and the method used to determine the content (note) less than or equal to .3 weight percent sulfur in the fuel as regulated by the State of Massachusetts 

The fuel supplier must submit a comprehensive Spill Prevention & Response Plan for approval before an award will be made.  The supplier must prove that they can effectively prevent and contain any fuel spills and prevent contamination to the surrounding ground, storm drains or downhill contamination to local waterways.  The contractor must certify that their drivers have been trained on spill prevention.  They must also prove that they have an effective means of communication during a spill containing 10 or more gallons.  This plan shall include emergency contact numbers for:  their own company, remediation companies and State & Federal authorities in the event of a major fuel spill containing 10 or more gallons.  The agency has its own spill plan and does deploy storm drain covers during each delivery.  The agency also has a Safety department that will make required State & Federal notifications in the event of a spill.  This does not relieve the contractor from knowing what to do or who to call during the unlikely event of major oil spill.

All interested parties MUST be registered in the System for Award Management (SAMS) Database and the Vetbiz database.   Contractors may submit all proposals and quotes to the Contract Specialist  Patricia Newberry no later than December 20, 2017  at 12PM.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<BR><BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.
(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms contract, contractor, and Contracting Officer shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.
(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.5071, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.
(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<BR><BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106270, insert the following provision:

<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U. S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent Federal agency which manages the U.S. Government's foreign assistance program, providing assistance for developing countries around the world in the areas of economic growth and trade, agriculture and the environment, education and training, democracy and governance, reconstruction and stabilization, global health, global partnerships and humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Within USAID, the Office of Acquisition and Assistance (OAA) oversees the solicitation, selection, award and administration of contracts, grants and cooperative agreements in support of the agency's development assistance objectives.  Procurement actions may involve the private or the public sectors, international organizations, non-government and private voluntary organizations, educational institutions, and host country organizations (both private and public sector). Because of the unique aspect of implementing procurement actions in an overseas context, USAID has implemented a supplement to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR), the AID Acquisition Regulations (AIDAR).  In the course of a year, total procurement actions (both acquisition and assistance) may exceed $11 billion.</p>
<p>The Washington headquarters Office of Acquisition and Assistance deals with both domestic and non-domestic (foreign and international) procurement actions, requiring the ability to recognize and understand a broad spectrum of very different cultures, and to accommodate contractual requirements to very different implementing environments, reconciling Federal procurement policies and procedures with host country policies and procedures, usually in highly visible and complex countries, and often involving coordination among numerous donor countries and organizations.</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.

<p>AAPD 06-10 - PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 28, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm.  Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>The purpose of this amendment is to provide information on RFI notice W31P4Q-18-R-0037.</p>
<p>a. Question: Is the Government considering Electronic Trainers (ET) or Table Top Trainers?</p>
<p>Answer: Interactive simulation and live training will be required, however a determination on whether Electronic Trainers (ET) or Table Top Trainers will be used has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>b. Question: Similar to the "Non-Kinetic Effector" description, does the term "Gun Effector" imply the Gun will need to engage and counter UAS? How about other targets/threats; ATGM Team, IFV, Rotary Wing, etc.</p>
<p>Answer: IM-SHORAD enhances cross-domain fires through a layered and tiered employment of short-range air defense capabilities. This layered methodology provides overlapping and mutually supporting sensors and shooters and when combined with a tiered employment methodology, provides the commander a variety of kill mechanisms to match appropriate shooters to targets. A layered and tiered approach increases the effectiveness of individual systems, improves survivability versus all threats, and reduces the number of systems required to accomplish a given mission.</p>
<p>c. Question: Will the Gun Effector performance specification be provided in the Request for Proposal (RFP) as a Test Requirement for down-select between a .50 cal and 30mm?</p>
<p>Answer: The determination of whether or not to use a .50 cal or 30mm gun effector has not yet been decided. Should the Government decide to direct the gun effector, a decision will be made at that time on consideration of providing the performance specification.</p>
<p>d. Question: Regarding the Non-Kinetic Effector and Priority two that identifies detection of low-altitude air targets and ground targets, do these targets include autonomous air and ground threats not being remotely controlled?</p>
<p>Answer: Some of the targets are controlled by datalinks to a ground controller, while some have greater autonomy negating the need for a ground controller or GPS navigation. Some fly preplanned routes and return to the ground controller and do not require active data links for flight.</p>
<p>e. Question: What does "Army Fielded" mean?</p>
<p>Answer: Qualified and in the U.S. Army inventory</p>
<p>f. Question: Does an EW effector system that has been tested, purchased and is currently being used in the field by the Army qualify as a fielded system? Some were rapidly acquired and are in the field but they didn't go through the formal JCIDS process to include Milestone A, B and C.<br /><br />Answer: A system that has an Urgent Material Release and is currently fielded or deployed to U.S. Army Soldiers will be accepted. The following required documents allow the Government to field equipment to meet an urgent requirement, per AR 700-142, Table 4-7.</p>
<p>1a. User requested Operational Needs Statement (ONS) and Deputy Chief of Staff (DCS), G-3/5/7 validation memo OR <br />1b. Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) directed requirement memo and G-3/5/7 approved capabilities document [Requirements Oversight Council (ROC)/Operational Requirement Document (ORD)/Initial Capabilities Document (ICD)/Capability Development Document (CDD)/Capability Production Document (CPD)]</p>
<p>2. Safety Health Data Sheet (SHDS) [state all known safety &amp; health hazards; coordinate w/ Public Health Command (PHC) for health hazards &amp; obtain Army Test and Evaluation Command (ATEC) safety confirmation]</p>
<p>3. Air worthiness statement-- IF APPLICABLE (frequently not)</p>
<p>4. An Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) supportability statement-- IF APPLICABLE (frequently not)</p>
<p>5. Program Manager (PM) request for Gaining Command (GC) acceptance (identify limitations and risks identified by AMCOM Safety in SHDS)</p>
<p>6. GC acceptance statement (signed by General Officer/Senior Executive Service Member)</p>

<DESC><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">The U. S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plans to seek proposals from small business firms for participation in Phase I of the Fiscal Year 2018 (FY18) NOAA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. NOAA's FY18 Phase I is authorized under Federal SBIR/STTR programs, which have been extended through&nbsp;</span><span class="aBn" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #cccccc; position: relative; top: -2px; z-index: 0; color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"><span class="aQJ" style="position: relative; top: 2px; z-index: -1;">September 30, 2022</span></span><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">, as part of the 55th National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).</span><br style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;" />
<p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">The SBIR program is a highly competitive program that encourages domestic small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&amp;D) with the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR enables small businesses to explore their technological potential and provides the incentive to profit from its commercialization. By including qualified small businesses in the nation's R&amp;D arena, high-tech innovation is stimulated and the United States gains entrepreneurial spirit as it meets its specific research and development needs.</p>
<p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">During Phase I of the NOAA SBIR Program, small businesses are invited to submit innovative research proposals in response to the priorities outlined in the latest NOAA Strategic Research Guidance Memorandum (SRGM). NOAA's research priorities include (i) Integrated Earth System Processes &amp; Predictions, (ii) Observing System Optimization, (iii) Decision Science, Risk Assessment &amp; Risk Communication, (iv) Data Science, (v) Water Prediction and (vi) Arctic Research. A description of each of these priorities can be found on the memorandum, located at&nbsp;<a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://nrc.noaa.gov/CouncilProducts/StrategicResearchGuidanceMemorandum.aspx" target="_blank">http://nrc.noaa.gov/CouncilProducts/StrategicResearchGuidanceMemorandum.aspx</a>.&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Specific subtopics will be available&nbsp;with the solicitation release.</span></strong>&nbsp; It is during this phase that small businesses establish technical merit, feasibility and proof of concept for the proposed innovative solution. Any organization or individuals receiving awards under Phase I are eligible to compete for a follow-up Phase II award. It is important for potential small business firms to note that intellectual rights to their innovative research ideas belong to them, and are protected under the federal SBIR legislation.</p>
<p style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">The FY18 SBIR Phase I solicitation will be issued on or about&nbsp;<span class="aBn" style="border-bottom: 1px dashed #cccccc; position: relative; top: -2px; z-index: 0;"><span class="aQJ" style="position: relative; top: 2px; z-index: -1;">October 17, 2017</span></span></span></strong>. The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541715. The SBIR solicitation will be available at the Federal Business Opportunities website&nbsp;<a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://www.fbo.gov/" target="_blank">www.fbo.gov</a>&nbsp;under Solicitation Number NOAA2018-1.&nbsp;<strong><em>Please do not submit questions regarding this specific solicitation at this time.</em></strong>&nbsp;After release of the solicitation, it will be the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for any amendments to the solicitation. The Government anticipates making multiple Phase I awards, each with a period of performance of six (6) months and a ceiling price not to exceed $120,000.00.</p>

A possible source of information for small businesses to use in helping to navigate these systems and learn more about contracting with the government is the Association of Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC).

Some bolt holes may be smaller than the bolt specified on the drawings. Reaming of the bolts holes may be required to obtain a body bound condition.</p>
<p>2.2.2 ELECTRICAL WIRING: Installation of all electrical wiring, conduit, and components shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of NFPA 70. As a minimum the following shall be followed:</p>
<p>&bull; All electrical connections shall be installed in accordance with NFPA 70 sections 110.14 or 430.9, as applicable, or as recommended by the device manufacturer.</p>
<p>&bull; Crimped terminal lugs, if used, shall be properly sized for the wire and installed using the device(s) - e.g., crimping tool and indenter - recommended by the terminal lug manufacturer.</p>
<p>&bull; All spare conductors shall be identified as spare conductors, and shall have their ends insulated to preclude accidental contact with energized equipment.</p>
<p>&bull; Adhesive-backed wiring tie wraps and cable-clamping devices shall not be used when mounting to control panel backplanes unless they are secured with fasteners, in addition to the adhesive. In other locations, use of adhesive-back wiring tie wraps and cable-clamping devices should be minimized as much as practical.</p>
<p>&bull; Wiring around sharp edges, such as panel doors, shall be wrapped in protective sleeves (e.g., "spiral wrap") to prevent wiring insulation damage from chaffing, cutting, or abrasion.</p>
<p>&bull; Control panels shall not be used as raceways for conductors not terminating within the panel.</p>
<p>&bull; Bushings or chafing protection gear shall be used on all panel conduit entries.</p>

<p>&bull; McAfee VirusScan Enterprise (VSE)<br />&bull; McAfee Drive Encryption (DE)<br />&bull; McAfee File and Removable Media Protection (FRP)<br />&bull; McAfee Data Loss Prevention Endpoint (DLPe)<br />&bull; McAfee Network Data Loss Prevention (DLP)<br />&bull; McAfee Web Gateway (MWG)</p>
<p>To enhance SSA's current McAfee anti-malware solution, SSA has a requirement to decrease the amount of time it takes to identify and remediate advanced malware that might not be detected when only using a signature-based malware detection method. SSA requires advanced and intelligent threat detection tools that must be equal to or comparable to McAfee Threat Intelligence Exchange (TIE) and Advance Threat Defense (ATD). To continue to protect SSA's network from zero-day threats this advanced anti-malware tool must meet the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>&bull; Must integrate with SSA's existing security infrastructure, McAfee ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO).<br />&bull; Must integrate with SSA's existing endpoint anti-malware products, McAfee VirusScan Enterprise (VSE) and McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS).<br />&bull; Must integrate with SSA's existing web proxy software McAfee WebGateway (MWG). <br />&bull; Integration with McAfee products must not require a third party product.<br />&bull; Infrastructure must provide redundancy through load balancing or clustering. <br />&bull; Must support up to 170,000 endpoints with a unified infrastructure.<br />&bull; Must be compliant with FIPS processing standards.<br />&bull; Must provide ability to integrate with McAfee Global Threat Intelligence (GTI). <br />&bull; Must provide ability to integrate with third party cloud based file reputation repositories such as VirusTotal.<br />&bull; Must provide ability for the administrator to add new threat reputations as well as override existing threat reputations provided by McAfee GTI.<br />&bull; Must allow threat reputation data to be shared in real time with MWG proxies as well as endpoints running VSE or ENS via Data Exchange Layer (DXL). Must allow VSE, ENS, and MWG the ability to block or delete malicious files based on the supplied threat reputation data.<br />&bull; Must include self-protection mechanisms to prevent users from disabling the software.<br />&bull; Must provide ability to whitelist files and executables based on file hash to prevent additional scanning and analysis.<br />&bull; Must provide an on premise hosted appliance based solution that can automatically analyze files for malicious behavior using both static and dynamic analysis. The appliance(s) must also:<br />o Must accept both automatic and manual upload of potentially malicious files for analysis. <br />o Must provide ability to detonate/analyze malicious payloads in a virtual sandbox. Must provide detailed reports on payload detonation for review by an administrator or analyst.<br />o Must provide support for analyzing Microsoft Windows and Android based malware.<br />o Must be able to be configured to automatically share threat intelligence data on analyzed files with VSE, ENS or MWG in order to facilitate automatic blocking or deletion of files that are determined to be malicious.<br />o Must have ability to audit actions taken within the appliance solution.<br />o Must provide the ability to back up and restore the appliance configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Interested vendors shall submit capability statements that demonstrate their expertise in the above-described areas in sufficient detail, including any other specific and relevant information, so the Government can determine the firm's experience and capability to provide the requirements. Failure to demonstrate the capability of providing the requirement in response to this market survey may affect the Government's review of the industry's ability to perform or provide these requirements. Capability statements must be submitted via email at Katherine.Medeiros@ssa.gov by 1:00 EST on 12/22/2017. SSA will not honor or acknowledge requests for copies of a solicitation. Oral communications are not acceptable. The Government will not accept or return phone calls related to this Market Survey.</p>

<DESC>**This notice has been superseded by pre-solicitation notice N00039-18-R-0009**
Please direct all inquiries on the CANES Training Virtual Environment to the N00039-18-R- 0009 pre-solicitation notice.

*****UPDATED ON 9/21/2017*****
The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR), in support of the Program Executive Office for Command Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence (PEO C4I) Program Manager, Warfare (PMW) 160, Tactical Networks, intends to issue a Full and Open competitive Request for Proposal (RFP) N00039-17-R-0007 for the procurement of a Virtual Environment (VE) Training solution in support of the Consolidated Afloat Networks and Enterprise Services (CANES) program in Q1FY18 timeframe.
CANES is the Navy's Program of Record (POR) that consolidates and replaces existing afloat networks providing the necessary infrastructure for applications, systems and services required to dominate the cyber warfare tactical domain. CANES represents a key aspect of the Navy's modernization planning by upgrading cybersecurity, command and control, communications and intelligence systems afloat, and by replacing unaffordable and obsolete networks.
The Government anticipates issuing a single-award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. The contract will include a five (5) year ordering period. The Government anticipates utilizing a Cost Plus Fixed- Fee (CPFF) / Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) CLIN structure for development of the Virtual Environment of the current CANES Operational Baseline, Trainers, and Hosting Environment. Notionally, it's the Government's intent to issue the initial Task Order (TO) for the CANES Operational training baseline on a CPIF completion basis. Changes to the CANES Operational Baseline that will occur due to obsolescence and software changes, as well as the hosted and connected applications curriculum, will be issued on a CPFF Level of Effort (LOE) basis.
This notice is provided for information only; it is not a Request for Proposal and is not be to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a contract.  The Government will not pay for any effort expended in response to this notice. All questions/comments are to be submitted in writing to the Contract Specialist, Susana Wiker, email address at susana.l.wiker@navy.mil and Contracting Officer, Kim Reidy, email address at kimberly.reidy@navy.mil.
Future information, if released, will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) at https://www.fbo.gov/ and SPAWAR E-Commerce Central website at https://e-commerce.sscno.nmci.navy.mil/.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring these sites for additional information pertaining to this notice.

<AWARDEE>Ballard Industrial, 4749 Ballard Ave NW, Seattle, WA 98107-4810 US
<DESC>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Walla Walla District, has entered into a firm fixed-price contract with Ballard Industrial for the purchase of one (1) Man Rider Infinity Air Winch Model #: Fa2iMRA/D17. The NAICS code for this procurement is 333923.
<p>The contract action is for commercial supplies for which the Government awarded, single source, to Ballard Industrial under the authority of FAR 6.302-2(2)- Unusual and Compelling Urgency: "When the agency's need for the supplies or services is of such an unusual and compelling urgency that the Government would be seriously injured unless the agency is permitted to limit the number of source from which it solicits bids or proposals, full and open competition need not be provided for."</p>
<p>The urgent need of the item is based on the fact we have a current contract in operation for the repairs on Unit 5 starting in January that rely on a safe operational winch system. This contract will incur costly delays without the winching system fully operational as well as delay in returning the unit 5 to service on time which results in loss of revenue from power generation.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES OR FOR PROPOSALS. All responses to this notice of award may be emailed to Chandra D. Crow, at Chandra.d.crow@usace.army.mil. Reference W912EF18P0016 in the subject line.</p>

Agency and Contracting Activity: Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Joint Field Office (JFO), 6021 Rio Grande Road, Orlando, FL 32809 proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition. <br /><br />2. Nature and/or Description of the Action being approved: FEMA has a requirement for one each stretch-octagon shelter to replace the damage one on-hand for Thomasville MERS in response to hurricane Irma in Florida. Compatibility with the other tent on-hand is critical to the mission success of MERS. The shelter must be able to successfully attach to other tents on-hand when applicable. <br /><br />3. Description of Supplies/Services: The Government requires a stretched-octagon shelter &ndash; rigid frame that is 19 feet x 35 feet x 6 feet, 570 square feet usable floor space. It includes shelter frame, roof, etc. The shelter comes with a self-contained and portable HVAC. It provides 42,000 Btu/hr. of cooling and 40,000 Btu/hr. of heating. <br /><br />4. Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: The statutory authority permitting only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 entitled, &ldquo;Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.&rdquo; <br /><br />5. Demonstration That the Nature of the Acquisition Required Use of the Authority Cited: MER located in Thomasville provides support throughout FEMA. They are in possession of several sectional style tents with the capability to connect them together. The manufacturer and retailer Western Shelter retails and sells direct to consumer. Market research indicated that the retailer&rsquo;s prices would far exceed the price if purchased directly from the manufacturer. Pricing will be given under GSA Federal Supply Contract No GS-03F-084CA. FEMA possesses other shelters and compatibility is necessary in order to satisfy the agency requirement to support disasters. There is not a reasonable expectation of receiving more than one quoted from another source. The shelter needed by FEMA is available from only one responsible source and no other type of property will satisfy the needs of the organization. This is within scope and guidance pf 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1). <br /><br />6. Description of Efforts Made To Ensure That Offers Are Solicited From As Many Potential Sources As Is Practicable: The J&amp;A document will be advertised through FedBizOpps to allow industry to know what the agency is requesting and potentially provide fair marketplace alternatives. <br /><br />7. Determination by Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost To the Government Will Be Fair And Reasonable: Prices are located in GSA. GSA already have negotiated pricing and are available to all government agencies. According to GS-03F-0084CA, the prices reflect a 9.5% discount off commercial prices. Price is determined to be fair and reasonable based on GSA pre-negotiated pricing rates. <br /><br />8. Description of Market Research: No Market research has been performed due to the shelters being manufactured and retailed by one source. <br /><br />9. Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition: None <br /><br />10. A Listing of Sources, if Any, That Express, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: N/A <br /><br />11. Planned Actions to Remove Barriers to Competition for Similar, Subsequent Requirement: Due to the shelters being manufactured and retailed by one company, it would require other manufactures to build to specification that are currently proprietary. <br /><br />12. Contracting Officer&rsquo;s Certification: I certify that the data supporting the recommended use of other than full and open competition is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br /><br />MICHAEL C. BONDS&nbsp; <br />Contracting Officer Technical/Requirement Personnel Certification:<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>The Imaging X-Ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) project was competitively selected through NASA's Announcement of Opportunity (AO) process: AO-NNH14ZDA0130, 2014 Small Explorer (SMEX). IXPE submitted a Step-1 proposal in December 2014 and was notified of final selection as a NASA project on January 4, 2017. A key component of the IXPE science instrument are three Mirror Module Assemblies (MMAs) to focus x-rays onto detectors. The MMAs each contain 24 x-ray mirror shells that are fabricated using precisely shaped (a few micron tolerance) mandrels. These electroless nickel coated mandrels require precision diamond turning machining to achieve the final figure required to fabricate the MMAs. MSFC intends to award&nbsp;the diamond turning machining&nbsp;effort to the Small Business WaveFront Technology Inc. (hereinafter WaveFront). WaveFront utilizes a Nanotech HDL 200 Ultra-precision CNC Horizontal Drum Lathe that meets the&nbsp;specialized&nbsp;requirements&nbsp;for precision turning and metrology of the IXPE larger size mandrels. WaveFront has extensive experience in the commercial industry performing this precision diamond turning machining within schedule requirements. The mandrels must be completed, inspected, and accepted in the last quarter of 2018.<br /><br />The Government intends to acquire this service in accordance with FAR Part 12.<br /><br />All responsible SBA Small Business&nbsp;organizations may submit a written response to be considered by the agency describing their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort, via email, to the identified point of contract not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time on December 30, 2017.&nbsp;Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive bases. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition bases, based upon responses to this notice, is solely with the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. <br /><br />NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <a href="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_libray/Omb.Html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_libray/Omb.Html</a>.
