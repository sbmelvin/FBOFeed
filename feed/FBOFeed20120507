All items to be provided should preferably be Commercial Off -the-Shelf (COTS). A brief technical description and proposed layout are attached.</p>
<p>The procurement will follow the NATO procedures for International Competitive Bidding (ICB). Bidding will be in accordance with the One-Step procedure.</p>
<p>The reference for the IFB is NDLO/2012/007.</p>
<p>BIDDING PROCEDURE</p>
<p>Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB, which requires that the NATO member governments nominate to the bidders list those firms that are located within their borders. Before the U.S. Government can nominate a U.S. firm to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, the firm must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website:</p>
<p>http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm</p>
<p>The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA. The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:</p>
<p>- the title and/or solicitation number of the project<br />- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents</p>
<p>After approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the U.S. Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project. NATO-member governments use a DOE to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT DATES:</p>
<p>Request from the Department of Commerce that a&nbsp;DOE be issued (and, for firms new to NATO ICB, submit completed one-time NATO ICB application):&nbsp;no later than 25 May 2012</p>
<p>IFB planned to be issued: June 2012</p>
<p>Bid Closing: 42 days after issuance of the IFB</p>
<p>Implementation of the project is expected to take place within 12 months of contract signature.</p>

<p>Period of Performance: <br />Contract period is anticipated to be on or around August 1, 2012 through July 30, 2013 with four (4) one-year option year periods.

The contracts will be for a one (1) year base with four (4) one-year option year periods, for a total of five (5) years. Individual task orders will identify the specific time frames required for completion of work. Time frames will be established based on the magnitude and complexity of the task order project.

<p>Each awarded contractor will be guaranteed a minimum of $5,000.00 during the term of the contract including the option year periods. The minimum ordering limitation per task order will be $3,000.00. The maximum ordering limitation per task order will be $1,000,000.00 per year. Task orders will generally range between $20,000.00 and $100,000.00. Competition for issuance of task orders will be limited to awardees under this contract.

He led the development of standards for program and personnel evaluation and designed WMU's interdisciplinary doctoral program in evaluation. He led or assisted development of evaluation offices and systems for the U.S. Office of Education, National Center for Vocational and Technical Education, Southwest Regional Educational Laboratory, and the school districts in Columbus and Xenia, Ohio; Saginaw, Michigan; Dallas, Texas; and Montana State Education Department. He has conducted evaluations in education, community development, economic development, housing, military personnel evaluation, state and national assessment, and other areas; lectured and consulted in more than 20 countries; and advised and assisted many organizations in the United States and abroad. He helped found the American Evaluation Association (AEA). His publications include 24 books and monographs and about 100 journal articles and book chapters. His latest books include-edited with Thomas Kellaghan of Ireland-the International Handbook of Educational Evaluation (Springer, 2003) and-with Anthony Shinkfield of Australia-Evaluation Theory, Models, &amp; Applications (Jossey-Bass, 2007). Currently, he is completing, with Dr. Chris Coryn, the second edition of Evaluation Theory, Models, &amp; Applications and authoring a chapter on Institutionalizing/Mainstreaming Evaluation. He has developed numerous evaluation checklists and currently is completing an automated version of his Program Evaluations Metaevaluation Checklist (which is keyed to the 2011 edition of the Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation Program Evaluation Standards.) His AEA New Directions for Evaluation (NDE) monograph, titled Evaluation Models is NDE's all-time best seller.

A new IDIQ procurement that includes program evaluation support services is currently in review with the intention of multiple awards. Using one of our existing contractors, or one of the new contractors who may be bidding on the upcoming IDIQ contract, could create unfair competition and could cause that contractor to be disqualified from bidding on the procurement. Delaying the award of this contract until after the IDIQ contract has been awarded to avoid this inherent conflict of interest would not be in the best interest of the government due to the time delay. </span></p>

The outcome from this sole source procurement is intended to serve as a strategic guide not only to FRA R&amp;D program managers, but also to the other contractors in their performance of evaluative functions for the FRA in the long term. Any contractor with a material and substantial vested interest in long-term contract work with FRA, who is also responsible for the development of strategic guidance both internal and external to the agency, would be naturally biased toward developing recommendations to suit their own interests. Moreover, having participated in the development of strategic guidance on program evaluation activities would give them a competitive edge over the other IDIQ contractors. Consequently, the hiring of a sole proprietor without any prior relationship to FRA, and who does not intend on bidding on substantial evaluative work with FRA, will eliminate any potential barriers to competition and any questions regarding unfair competition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<DESC>1. The United States Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA) at Kings Point, NY is seeking proposals for student health insurance from qualified insurance companies (Carriers). This Request for Proposal (RFP) is for a Student Health Insurance Policy (SHIP) that will provide health care insurance coverage to the general population of USMMA students, who are from this point forward referred to as Midshipmen, while on or off campus 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, worldwide.<br /><br />2. For the purposes of this proposal request, USMMA is interested in utilizing a PPO (Preferred Provider Organization) design.<br /><br />3. Under a hard waiver program, USMMA requires all full time undergraduate Midshipmen to carry health insurance that meets specific requirements.<br /><br />4. Insurance coverage is to begin See SOW.<br /><br />5. Price Adjustments: USMMA seeks realistic initial year premium quotations with normal rate fluctuations in subsequent years. Rates may be revised annually at the beginning of each new contract year. Any revision in annual rates must be justified and made available for USMMA's review and approval of a minimum of four (4) months prior to March 1st. While USMMA recognizes the right of the carrier to quote renewal premiums after the first year, it is expected that such premiums will be based on precise claim experience. The carrier is also expected to discuss with USMMA the assumptions and methodology used in the rate development. Written documentation which justifies the negotiated renewal rates, methodology and economic price adjustment is required.<br /><br />6. Plans must meet current and future State and Federal Requirements including provisions of the Affordable Care Act.<br /><br />7. It is USMMA's goal to provide a plan to Midshipmen that provides good coverage at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />8. The RFP will be posted on or about May 8th, 2012. <br />

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Illumina Inc., 9885 Towne Centre Drive, San Diego, California 92121-1975 to procure the following:</p>
<p>1. MiSeq System, Catalog Number: SY-410-1001, Quantity: One (1) Each. (Trade-In for GAIIX Sequencer, Model: 1206, Serial Number: 3001601.<br />2. MiSeq Expansion Pack, Catalog Number: SY-410-1002-PRE, Quantity: One (1) Each.<br />3. Shipping and Insurance.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) is a centralized research facility for performing high-throughput, large-scale DNA sequencing and sequence analysis. NISC currently has eight (8) Illumina's Genome Analyzer (GA) IIx and three (3) HiSeq 2000 Systems which are proven platform for genetic analysis and functional genomics. The instrument's parallel sequencing technology leverages clonal cluster formation and proprietary reversible terminator chemistry to give it the speed and reduce the cost of large-scale sequencing to generate billions of bases of high-quality DNA sequence per run. Illumina Sequencing technology also provides an easy-to-use protocol that does not require emulsion PCR which allows for a self-contained system that minimizes handling errors and contamination concerns, eliminating the need for robotics or clean rooms.</p>
<p>The MiSeq System will provide a fast and cheaper approach in the quality control (QC) of the prepared library samples before it is loaded onto the more expensive HiSeq2000 System. Currently, one of the major problems is that the HiSeq instrument requires a tight titer of cells. By achieving the correct titer concentration from the MiSeq data will reduce the number of repeats, failures and expense on the HiSeq instrument and provide better quality data. Only the MiSeq can achieve this accuracy because it has the same platform as the HiSeq and GA IIx. The MiSeq System was developed based on the Illumina software for data analysis. The MiSeq system is compatible with the existing Illumina Software and Equipment and if another source was used the Government would lose research data, labor time and would have to replace the existing hardware to redevelop the process and integrate a new instrument which would be disruptive to NHGRI's research studies. Illumina is the sole manufacturer of the MiSeq System that is being procured and the manufacturer of the existing systems that NHGRI/NISC is currently using. No other source can be substituted.<br /><br />Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing and the Small Business Size Standard is 500 Employees. The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001) and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-58 (April 18, 2012). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis, May 11, 2012, 7:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct future competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Inquires to this announcement, referencing synopsis number NHLBI-CSB-(HG)-2012-143-DLM, may be submitted to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisition, COAC Services Branch, 6701 Rockledge Drive, Suite 6149, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7902, Attention: Dorothy Maxwell. Response may be submitted electronically to maxwelld@mail.nih.gov. Faxes will not be accepted. Responses will only be accepted if dated and signed by an authorized company representative.</p>
<p>Note: In order to receive an award from NHLBI, contractors must have a valid registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov, and ORCA https://orca.bpn.gov/login.aspx.</p>

<CONTACT>Anthony M Langer, Phone 3017372577, Email anthony.langer@navy.mil - Dora L Hill, Phone (301) 737-2495, Email dora.hill@navy.mil
<DESC>THE INTENT OF THIS BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) IS TO ESTABLISH GOVERNMENT-UNIVERSITY AQUISITION VEHICLES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TRADITIONAL FAR/DFARS TYPE CONTRACTS AND/OR NON-PROCUREMENT AGREEMENTS (eg. COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS) IN SUPPORT OF BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR THE NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND. <br /><br />1. INTRODUCTION
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division is soliciting proposals from Universities to develop a long term partnership with NAWCAD to enhance Science Technology and Engineering and Math (STEM) education and collaborate on advanced research in support of Naval Aviation.</p>
<p>2. BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The purpose of this broad agency announcement is to establish a collaborative relationship between NAWCAD and an academic institution to improve the scope of advanced research and educational program development which relate to Naval Aviation. Under this effort the participants will work on a broad range of research and educational projects pursued at NAWCAD, the participating academic institution or both depending on the availability of qualified personnel and facilities at each location. NAWCAD and the participating institution will provide appropriate access to their facilities in support of these educational and research projects. These efforts will be conducted primarily at the agreement holder's site, but NAVAIR facilities may also be available and/or used depending on project needs By combining the personnel and facilities of NAWCAD and the academic institution, both parties will improve the overall ability to conduct research needed to solve current and future technological challenges pertinent to naval aviation weapons systems.</p>
<p>New educational opportunities shall be developed between NAWCAD and the academic institution which will focus on meeting the future technology needs for Naval Aviation. Types of collaborative efforts will include the development of undergraduate and graduate educational opportunities. These opportunities could involve the development of curriculum, assisting in participating as course instructors and the establishment of a cooperative educational program.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of this type of collaboration, it is anticipated that the work will require personnel from the academic institution and NAWCAD to be able to meet frequently and on relatively short notice in each other's place of business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST</p>
<p>The Navy is interested in, but not limited to, researching the following areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Human Systems</p>
<p>- Development of thermoelectric devices for manufacture</p>
<p>- CFD development of vector curves for parachute opening (kinematics modeling)</p>
<p>&bull; Propulsion &amp; Power</p>
<p>- 3-D CFD flow analysis</p>
<p>- Rotor spin pit analysis, modeling of thermal gradients</p>
<p>- Aircraft generator systems diagnostics &amp; health management</p>

<p>- Propulsion of Rotorcraft Systems</p>
<p>- Propulsion prognosis and life management</p>
<p>- Probabilistic risk assessment of engines</p>
<p>&bull; Air Vehicles and Unmanned Systems</p>
<p>- Air Vehicle prognosis</p>
<p>- Airframe reliability and risk assessment methodology</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE</p>
<p>NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions). Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 (Congressional direction requires that at least 50 percent (50%) of the cost of a project under this initiative be provided by industry) and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects. Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research. Final decision(s) on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.</p>
<p><br />NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project. Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal). In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.</p>

<p>(2) VOLUME II - COST/FUNDING PROPOSAL. Cost/funding proposals are not restricted in length, have no specific page layout requirements, and should address funding periods of performance. Formal work breakdown structures (WBS) and certified cost or pricing data are neither required nor desired, however, NAVAIR reserves the right to request this information for proposals using FAR/DFARS type contracts. Organize Cost/Funding proposals to include four (4) sections in the following order:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Section 1 - Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work (SOW) and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing.</p>
<p>2) Section 2 - Cost Sharing and In-Kind Contributions: This section will include: (i) the sources of cash and amounts to be used for matching requirements; (ii) the specific in-kind contributions proposed, their value in monetary terms, and the methods by which their values were derived; and (iii) evidence of the existence of adequate cash or commitments to provide sufficient cash in the future. Affirmative, signed statements are required from outside sources of cash. Provide sufficient information regarding the sources of the offerors' cost share so that a determination may be made by the Government regarding the availability, timeliness, and control of these resources. For example: How will the funds and resources be applied to advance the progress of the proposed effort? What is the role of any proposed in-kind contributions?</p>
<p>3) Section 3 - Cost to the Government: This section will specify the total costs proposed to be borne by the Government and any technical or other assistance including equipment, facilities, and personnel of Federal laboratories, if any, required to support these activities. The cost to the Government should be that portion of the proposed effort which is not covered by the contractor's portion of the cost share. The costs incurred and work performed by any DoD or national laboratory "partnering" with the offeror under the proposal shall normally be considered costs of the Government and not costs of the offeror for purposes of the cost-sharing requirement. Present sufficient information regarding the resources to be provided by the Government so that an evaluation of their availability, timeliness, and control may be made. <br />4) Section 4 - Off-Budget Supporting Resources: This section will show cash or in-kind resources which will support the proposed activity but which are not intended to be included in the total project cost. Items in this category do not count as cost share or as Federal funds, which must be matched. Examples of items to place in this category include: Commitments of cash or in-kind resources from other Federal sources, such as national laboratories, and projections of fee-based income where there is substantial uncertainty about the level which will actually be collected and where the income is not needed to meet cost-share requirements.</p>
<p>NOTE: Proposals will not be accepted after the due date stated on Page One (1).</p>
<p>6. EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.</p>
<p>6.1 EVALUATION CRITERIA</p>
<p>The primary evaluation criteria are:</p>
<p>(A) Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered.</p>
<p>(B) The offeror's capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives.</p>
<p>(C) The realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing.</p>
<p>(D) The proximity of the institution to NAWCAD necessary to allow use and access to the facilities at both the NAWC and the institution while minimizing cost in time and travel.</p>
<p>7. AWARDS</p>
<p>NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated in Section 2 and 3. All awards will be based on merit competition. The Government reserves the right to select all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations. There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $550,000, any large business is required to include a Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.</p>

<DESC>Market Survey for an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Optimization Kit<br><br>GENERAL INFORMATION:  The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey.  The U.S. Government acknowledges its obligations under 18 U.S.C.  1905 to protect information qualifying as "CONFIDENTIAL" under this statute.  Pursuant to this statute, the U.S. Government is willing to accept any trade secret or confidential restrictions placed on qualifying data forwarded in response to the survey questions and to protect it from unauthorized disclosure subject to the following:<br><br>1.  Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data as trade secret or confidential with the restrictive legend (all caps) "CONFIDENTIAL" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.<br><br>2.  In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly trade secret or confidential (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "CONFIDENTIAL" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below).  Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.<br><br>3.  The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data.  Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain.  Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.<br><br>4.  Confidential data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain any restrictive legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself.  Where appropriate for portions only of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends "CONFIDENTIAL DATA BEGINS:" and "CONFIDENTIAL PORTION ENDS."<br><br>5.  In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.<br><br>6.  The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain confidential information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "Confidential" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort.<br><br>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT:<br><br>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUESTING INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Also, it is not a request seeking contractors interested in being placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this questionnaire is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation document exists at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered.<br><br>PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENT:<br><br>The purpose of this questionnaire is to obtain information on commercial industry capability to satisfy U.S. Army requirements for an EOD Optimization Kit. <br><br>		The EOD Toolkit is specifically organized to provide the military EOD technicians with a combination of common tools and special tools and equipment that can be quickly transported to a threatened site and utilized to locate, identify, disarm, and remove unexploded ordnance of various types. The EOD Optimization Kit is an update to the EOD Response Kit.  <br><br>		1.  All components supplied with this set shall be industrial quality. For the purposes of this survey, the term "industrial quality tools" versus household-use tools or general purpose tools are defined as tools commercially marketed and manufactured for constant, rigorous, industrial or professional environment use. The items offered shall have either achieved industrial market acceptance or have been satisfactory supplied to the Government under current or recent contract for the same or similar requirements.  Industrial quality tools are used primarily by skilled professionals and technicians in such areas as machine shops, automotive maintenance and repair facilities, industrial automotive assembly plants, fleet maintenance facilities, and airline service facilities. The tools will be used for specialized application in an environment of virtual constant use, with application requiring high torque, low slippage, and strict tolerances. <br><br>		2.   All components must demonstrate Market Acceptance. Market acceptance is demonstrated by the component having a higher percentage of sales to industrial/professional customers than to retail or Government customers. Advertising or marketing literature that indicates "professional grade" or "industrial quality", or merely stating that an item is "professional grade" or "industrial quality" is insufficient to establish industrial quality tools since these are terms for which there is no generally accepted definition. A claim that an item is manufactured to an industry consensus standard is also insufficient to establish industrial quality tools. Evidence of acceptance by industrial/professional customers includes sales to fleet operators, distributors, Contractors, industrial and professional users, and sales to distributors who retail exclusively to the professional or industrial market.<br><br>		3.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Natick Contracting Division, has a requirement in support of  the US Army Medical Materiel Development Activity to procure a sole source Hyperbaric chambers and Certified Hyperbaric with Oxyheal Health Group  under the  authority of  FAR Subpart 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(A) and (B).  Oxyheal currently supports the Research Program at Camp Lejeune, Camp Pendleton, Fort Carson, and Joint Base Lewis-McChord.  Due to imposed changes by the FDA and DoD IRB committees, program direction required additional pilot research to be inserted into the timeline. Failure to maintain currently installed chambers and trained chamber technicians will invalidate approved research protocols, halt the collection of data, increase costs and negatively impact the study's ability to complete as required by the Vice Chiefs of Staff and Congress. This continued effort will be for a single 6 month period of performance with five optional 6 month periods.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement to the U.S. Army RDECOM Contracting Center, Natick Contracting Division via e-mail to: Nathan.c.jordan.civ@us.mail.mil no later than 9:00 a.m. on May 22, 2012.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. NO PROPOSALS ARE SOUGHT.<br /><br />Introduction and Background<br /><br />The Institute of Education Sciences (IES) at the United States Department of Education (ED) is conducting a study to: 1) identify promising strategies for providing parents with high-quality information that will help them to make effective school choices; and 2) examine the feasibility of an impact evaluation focused on this topic. Working in collaboration with the Office of Innovation and Improvement (OII), IES expects these tasks to contribute to department initiatives focused on improving both parent engagement and enhanced school choice.<br /><br />ED intends to procure research and development services designed to answer the following research questions (by topic area):<br /><br />A. Strategies for Evaluation<br />1. What are the key factors that school choice information strategies should include? <br />2. What are the available - exemplary and not - information strategies currently being developed or in use by districts with a diverse portfolio of choice options?<br /><br />B. Design and Feasibility of an Impact Study<br />1. Which promising school choice information strategies - either identified among those already in use or newly proposed - are feasible for both a rigorous evaluation and larger scale implementation (i.e., policy relevant)? <br />2. What is the counterfactual?<br />3. At what level might random assignment be conducted? <br />4. What outcomes would be of most interest and importance to examine when conducting an evaluation of school choice?<br />5. What other design options need to be considered?<br /><br />Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to conduct market research for the requirement entitled "Feasibility and Design of An Impact Evaluation of Strategies for Providing School Choice Information". ED needs to determine if there are small businesses that have the capacity and capability to perform the services required under this action. <br /><br />Responses are sought from small businesses with the following areas of knowledge, capabilities, and successful experiences:<br /><br />1. Conducting expert studies related to k-12 education and school choice;<br />2. Making valid conclusions that meet the purpose of proposed studies to inform policy-making decisions;<br />3. Expertise in or access to a reliable network of researchers with all or a combination of the following disciplines: data collection, data sampling, data analysis, study design, feasibility studies, impact evaluation studies, research evaluation, counterfactual theory, random assignment, k-12 education research, school choice, and school choice;<br />4. Ability to recruit subject-matter experts, coordinate, and convene panel meetings;<br />5. Ability to conduct research interviews; and<br />6. Ability to write and present research findings to enable policy-making decisions.<br /><br />Small businesses are encouraged to team with other large or small businesses for this requirement. ED is seeking information on whether small businesses are certified as HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Women-owned (WO), or 8(a). The Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) is included with this notice. <br /><br />Small Businesses should be aware of the changes made to the NAICS Code Structure per the Federal Register Notice issued March 12, 2012.

<DESC>This Notice of Intent is NOT a Request for Quotation (RFQ) for competitive quotes; however, in accordance with FAR Part 13 and Part 6.302-1, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends to award a sole source purchase order based on the authority of FAR 6.302-1 "only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements". FEMA intends to award this purchase order to MISTOP (Division of Acme Manufacturing Corp.) for the purchase of a SnoStop&reg; snow/mist filter system, which is considered a commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 2. This action is being performed in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) which states, "For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available". A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been approved by the Contracting Officer and is provided as an attachment to this notice.
<p>A comprehensive snow/mist filter system, which will filter as well as melt snow, is needed by FEMA, MWEOC for the continued reliable and safe operation of emergency generators during heavy fog and snow conditions. The snow/mist filter system must be custom designed to meet the requirements specified in the Statement of Work. MISTOP is believed to be the sole source provider of the SnoStop&reg; Snow Eliminator; there are no resellers. FEMA is unaware of other companies capable of providing a snow/mist filter system which both filters and melts snow. However, any company capable of providing an equivalent product may submit descriptive literature, specification sheets, etc., in order to allow the Government to perform an evaluation of your proposed product. This information should be emailed to Phyllis.Woodward@dhs.gov , or by fax to 540-542-2631, no later than May 29, 2012. Capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companies interestedin obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the followingtechnology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and mayinclude specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed a unique concept for providing electrical powerto high-altitude airships (HAA). These airships are intended to remain aloft at highaltitudes for extended periods of time for various potential scientific, commercial, anddefense uses. Powering HAA presents a challenge due to the extended periods betweenpossible refueling and the weight restrictions of these lighter-than-air airships.

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed active glasses to be worn by a pilot duringinstrument flight training and certification. Using a novel series of sensors todetermine head position, the glasses restrict the view out of the aircraft windscreen butallow the pilot to clearly see the entire instrument panel. Previous methods forrestricting a pilots view during instrument flight training and certification have useda hood draped across the aircraft windscreen or a face mask or blackened glasses worn bythe pilot. All current methods create potentially hazardous disorientation and anunnatural environment for the trainee. In particular, the face mask and blackened glassesrestrict the pilots peripheral vision and require uncomfortable and unnatural headpositions in order to see the entire instrument panel. The NASA innovation eliminates thehazards of the current methods and provides a safer and more comfortable means forrestricting viewing to improve the flight training experience.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<CONTACT>Cory L. Worley, Phone (757) 441-6886, Fax (757) 664-3823, Email cory.worley@noaa.gov
<DESC>The Department of Commerce National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Marine Fisheries Service Woods Hole, MA is issuing a notice of intent to negotiate sole source procurement with Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc. for providing a SEACAT plus Version 2 Profiler Pumped Conductivity, Temperature, Depth Recorder (CTD). The requirement is to include: (1) SBE 5M submersible pump, 64 MB of memory, (6) differential A/D channels (0-5 volt input range), (1) RS-232 data input channel, data I/O and pump Y-cable (PN 17709), 2.5 meter data I/O cable (PN 801225), SEASOFT software, and complete documentation. Also to be included is: (1) 600 meter plastic housing for CTD and SBE 5M plastic pump, (1) 600 meter strain gauge pressure sensor, (1) SBE 5P plastic pump, 600 meter, instead of SBE 5M plastic pump (required if using SBE 43 DO sensor), and (1) Wet-pluggable connectors (MCBH) instead of standard (XSG) connectors on SEACAT bulkhead connectors, data I/O and pump Y cable, and data I/O cable. The requirement is to include the option to procure two additional instruments, as specified above, if the funding becomes available. This instrument is designed and manufactured by Sea-Bird Electronics Inc. The statutory authority is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. The government intends to award a firm-fixed price purchase order for this requirement. The current requirement is to procure replacement CTD's. This replacement must be a SeaBird CTD because the operation of the program is based on SeaBird CTDs. If another vendor's CTD were purchased the agency would need to establish two training procedures and would need to deploy two sets of supporting hardware and software on each cruise. Spare instruments could not be swapped in the case of damage, malfunction, or loss and custom quality control/quality assurance software would need to be rewritten to handle a different data format. Because of the complications that arise, there would certainly be errors in hardware and software and thus the data collection of the program would be compromised. Standardization in instrumentation, software, hardware, and data format allows the CTD program to be operated on all NEFSC surveys including surveys on which CTD program staff do not participate. To bring a different type of CTD into the program would cause enormous disruption, result in errors in correctly assigning CTD type, and cost approximately 1 years' worth of a programmer's time to establish duplicate software routines to operate on the new instrument.
<p>NOAA's Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) runs a Conductivity, Temperature, Depth Sampling program that is responsible for measuring ocean temperature and salinity on all NEFSC surveys. The data is used by numerous NMFS, NOAA, academic and other scientific customers. The program collects oceanographic quality data that can be used in a range of applications including stock assessments, oceanographic monitoring, and climate studies.</p>
<p>At the heart of the program are approximately 10 SeaBird Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth instruments. These instruments are provided to each NEFSC survey by the CTD program. Scientists are trained in their use. Supporting software and hardware are deployed on the vessels. Spare instruments are provided in case of damage, malfunction or loss. Data is returned to the CTD program from the scientists on the vessels. A series of custom quality control and quality assurance routines are run and then the data is archived in NEFSC databases and at National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC).<br />No other entity can provide the necessary instrument and specifications required. If any other type of CTD instrument was purchased without these specifications it would put the Government at a costly and severe disadvantage. The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(c). The applicable NAICS code is 334519. Interested parties may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Responses shall be submitted by 12:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, May 22, 2012. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to cory.worley@noaa.gov .</p>

<RESPDATE>052212
<CONTACT>Maria L Mendoza, Phone (206)526-6671, Email Maria.L.Mendoza@noaa.gov
<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to procure services for the Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Services located in Seattle, WA on a sole source basis with Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. The government intends to acquire services using FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures. Proposed contract is for genetic analysis of tissue samples from Chinook Salmon caught in the 2012 commercial troll fishery. This project is collaboration with commercial fishermen of the Washington Trollers Association and other West Coast salmon genetics laboratories. Commercial fishers are paid to collect fin clips for genetic analysis from Chinook salmon, along with date, location, fishing depth, mark status, and fork length. By using standardized genetic markers and interagency shared reference data, mathematical models then describe not only stock compositions in time and space, but also stock-specific associations with oceanographic conditions (SST and SST anomaly, DO, chlorophyll, etc.) and hydrographic features (e.g., capes and canyons). The goal is to minimize broad time and area closures through improved understanding of the distribution of sensitive stocks. Two principal services are required. First, tissue samples must be obtained from commercial fishing boats and the fishers compensated through a subcontract between WDFW to the Washington Troller's Association. Second, WDFW must carry out the genetic analysis on a subset of those tissue samples. The additional samples would be delivered to NWFSC. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife is uniquely qualified to complete this project because of their relationship with the Washington Trollers Association and their network of port samplers as well as GAPS certification for the Genetic Laboratory. The Government intends to negotiate a firm fixed price contract with period of performance commencing approximately from date of award through March 31, 2013. The North American Industry Classification System code for this acquisition is 541690 with a corresponding size standard of $14.0M. It is the Government's belief that only Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife can complete this project. This notice represents the only official notice. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all submittals received by the due set forth in this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Responses must be faxed to Maria Mendoza at (206)527-7513 or provided by e-mail to maria.l.mendoza@noaa.gov. This is a simplified acquisition. ****The Western Acquisition Division, requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) as of October 1, 2003. After this date, NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR. For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov. In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all offerors must have a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number. A Dun &amp; Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun &amp; Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/eupdate or by phone at (800) 333-0505. All contractors are required to complete online Representations and Certifications at http://www.orca.bpn.gov to be eligible to receive an award.

Listed below are questions and answers that were asked concerning this solicitation.
Q1:  What is the density of the Hemlocks in the treatment area?
A1:  As stated in the PWS, (The Contractor is responsible for field checking site conditions prior to submitting a bid.)   In this site condition evaluation; contractor will arrive at estimate of stem density to create a bid. Though some sites on contract have been systemically treated before; acreage of some sites has been expanded and / or  health of trees has changed in sites.  These factors would undermine any reasonable estimate based on prior treatments.   Roads / trail treatment sites have high density and low density areas; again, these areas should be evaluated before creating a bid. 
This being said: A  rough estimate of stems per acre has been provided to CO and is available upon request.
Q2:  Have all trees been treated before?
A2:  No. Some trees have had a previous treatment and others have not.  Work on all sites as a "blank slate".  Stay within the outlined acreage and treat trees by contract protocol, regardless of the paint scheme observed.
Other Notes:
Chimney Tops trail , Site# 2, will be in a construction phase this Summer and Fall and closed to public.  HWA service Contract will be allowed in this area.  
Cosby Knob , Site #13, is a Cortect Treatment with imidacloprid tablets.  Treatments are with 2 tabs per inch Dbh for <20" and 3 tabs per inch Dbh for =>20".
Also note that the mix volume for Safari is greater than has been used on past treatments in the Park:  The below statement is found in PWS.
All hemlock trees in selected sites for dinotefuran treatments will receive (Safari 20SG) through soil drench, or soil injection with a Kioritz soil injector.  All treatments will be made with a solution of 3 pounds Safari 20SG and enough water to equal 552oz in final volume, using an application rate of: (1.2gai /grams active ingredient) to 1 inch of tree diameter at dbh (4.5 feet from the ground) for trees =>20"dbh:::and::::(.6gai /grams active ingredient) to 1 inch of tree diameter at dbh for trees <20.

<DESC>This Special Notice AMENDS the Special Notice N65236_SNOTE_00048D9E originallyposted on 2 May 2012, amending the technical requirement in #3 of submittalsbelow.Submissions are due nlt noon on the 4th of June 2012.DESCRIPTIONCommander Naval Sea Systems Command (COMNAVSEASYSCOM) requires a new FrequencyDivision Multiple Access (FDMA), land mobile radio (LMR) system to provideforce protection, damage control, and flight deck wireless communicationsonboard US Navy ships.Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic (SPAWARSYSCEN LANT), acting asthe AN/SRC-55 Project Manager/Engineering Office was tasked by NAVSEA toprocure this system. The current AN/SRC-55 HYDRA System is a modified,commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) trunked FDMA LMR system manufactured by HarrisCorporation in Lynchburg, VA. This system operates on a proprietary HarrisEnhanced Digital Access Communication System (EDACS) air interface scheduled tobe discontinued and replaced with the APCO-25 common air interface (CAI)starting in 2014.This specification was developed to articulate and document the requirementsfor shipboard implementation of an APCO-25 LMR system to provide forceprotection, damage control and flight deck communications. It is being sent toindustry in order to solicit feedback concerning the content and scope ofrequirements contained therein and to thence modify the specification asnecessary based on that feedback.Shipboard requirements include MIL-S-901D, Grade A & B, Class II shockandMIL-STD-167 vibration characteristics, MIL-STD-461 electromagneticinterference (EMI) and MIL-STD-464 EMI requirements, MIL-STD-810 environmentalrequirements. All fixed equipment is designed to meet MIL-S-901 Grade B shock,be FM Intrinsically Safe Certified, and are compliant with ship's electricalpower.System specific unique requirements include low power handheld radios(20mW/100mW), 380-399.9 MHz, and system ERP not greater than 200 mW. There arethree system RF outputs - one mast/external antenna feed and two radiatingtransmission line (RTL) antenna feeds for internal ship communications. Thesystem uses common transmit and receive antennas. Also required is flight deckruthless preemption (includes 5MC override and 4 levels of talk grouppreemption), interface with the 5MC announcing system and ship's telephonenetwork, a VHF/UHF cross-band repeating device referred to as a "linker" tosupport well deck and small watercraft operations. Special purpose subscriberequipment also includes integrated flight deck cranial/headsets that weredesigned to operate in noise fields produced by combat aircraft. Additionally,fixed mobile radios are located through-out the ship to provide location-basedwireless communications capabilities. 24 position battery chargers are requiredto support flight deck communications.The AN/SRC-55 must meet DOD IA requirements and hence must be certified andaccredited using the DOD Information Assurance Certification and AccreditationProcess (DIACAP) as specified by DOD INST 8510.01 of November 28, 2007. Inaddition, DOD requires the use of FIPS 197 Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)encryption certified in accordance with FIPS 140-2 in all new DOD LMR systems.The information below provides a list of certification requirements.SHIPBOARD REQUIREMENTS(1) MIL-S-901D, Grade A & B, Class II shock   (2) MIL-STD-167 vibrationcharacteristics   (3) MIL-STD-461 electromagnetic interference (EMI)   (4)MIL-STD-464 EMI requirements(5) MIL-STD-810 environmental requirement   (6) Allfixed equipment is designed to meet MIL-S-901 Grade B shock   (7) FMIntrinsically Safe Certified   (8) Compliant with ship's electrical power   (9)The AN/SRC-55 must meet DOD IA requirements and hence must be certified andaccredited using the DOD Information Assurance Certification and AccreditationProcess (DIACAP) as specified by DOD INST 8510.01 of November 28, 2007   (10)DOD requires the use of FIPS 197 Advanced Encryption Standard(AES)encryptioncertified in accordance with FIPS 140-2 in all new DOD M-SystemsSUBMITTALS   The information received shall be reviewed to conduct objective,comparative assessments and validation of commercial equipment and systems.This RFI is for INFORMATION GATHERING and PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY, and SHOULDNOT be construed as a Request for Proposal (RFP) or solicitation of an offer.The Government DOES NOT INTEND to award a contract on the basis of this RFI orotherwise pay for the information solicited.All information received will be treated as public knowledge; therefore,vendors should not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI.Specific information sought includes:  1. Company information, including name,address, and URL  2. A point of contact for follow-up information, and thepoint of contacts phone number and e-mail address   3.

WBR 1452.211-80    Notice of Intent to Acquire Metric Products and Services Bureau of Reclamation            MARCH 1993          (a) Metric Transition Plan.  The Department of the Interior on December 6, 1991, issued a Metric Transition Program (Part 758 Department Manual Chapter 1) to establish and describe the program's policies and responsibilities.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), has developed a Metric Transition Plan to implement metrication in Reclamation.  This plan describes Reclamation's overall strategy for using the metric system, defines general requirements and procedures for carrying out the transition, and details the tasks with milestones for Reclamation offices to complete.
(b) The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Trade Act).  
(1) Section 5164 of Public Law 100-418, the Trade Act, amended the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 and designated the metric system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.  
(2) The Trade Act establishes September 30, 1992, as the implementation date (to the extent economically feasible) for Federal agencies to use the metric system of measurement in its procurements, grants, and other business-related activities.  
(3) The Trade Act permits exceptions to the use of the metric system to the extent that such use is impractical or is likely to cause significant inefficiencies or loss of markets to United States firms, such as when foreign competitors are producing competing products in non-metric units.
(4) As a result of the Trade Act, the President issued Executive Order 12770 dated July 25, 1991, to implement the congressional designation of the metric system as the preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce.
(c) Bureau of Reclamation Implementation.  As a result of the Trade Act, Reclamation will, to the maximum extent practicable, use hard conversion and soft conversion metric systems in designing its construction projects, eventually phasing out use of the soft conversion metric system.  Exceptions to this policy will only be made when such use is impractical, produces inefficiencies or market losses, or is not economically feasible.
(d) Expected Results.  Reclamation expects its support of the metric system to result in increased use of the metric system by U.S. contractors, thereby increasing their ability to compete in the international marketplace.  Increasing use of the metric system by U.S. contractors will eliminate possible restrictions on their bidding in the international marketplace and will eliminate any impact of economic blocks by metric countries restricting the acceptance of non-metric products.

Any resultant contract will be a firm fixed price.<br />.<br /><strong>(iii)</strong> This document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-58 dated April 18, 2012. The clauses and provisions referenced in this solicitation may be reviewed/obtained in full text form at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm.<br /><br /><strong>(iv)</strong> This acquisition has not been set-aside for small businesses. The NAICS code is 334516.
<p><strong>(v)/(vi) STATEMENT OF WORK for Automatic Distillation Analyzer <br />Equipment Functional<br /></strong>&nbsp;Requirement #1: Stand-alone system capable of accomplishing in automated fashion all of the tasks specified in ASTM International test procedure D 86, paragraphs 6.5, 6.6, 10.8.2-10.11 as well as paragraphs 10.14, 10.14.2, 10.15, 10.17 and 11.3. The system must be capable of accomplishing all of these tasks for a range of petroleum products, including jet fuel, diesel fuel, gasoline and gasoline-ethanol blends. In particular, the instrument is capable of robotically:<br />1. Maintaining prescribed temperatures in two separate zones, namely the condenser, and the area enclosing the receiving cylinder.<br />2. Measuring petroleum sample temperature in 2 separate phases, namely temperature of the distilling vapor phase, and temperature of the liquid sample phase.<br />3. Regulating heating applied to the distillation flask during the early part of the test so that ASTM D 86, Table 5 test conditions are achieved for:<br />a. Time from first application of heat to sample until initial boiling point is achieved, and<br />b. Time from initial boiling point to 5% recovered for light products (Group 1 &amp; Group 2 products). <br />4. Automatically adjusting the heating so that throughout the middle of the test, uniform average rate of condensation meets requirements specified in ASTM D 86, Table 5.<br />5. Measuring the temperature of the distilled vapor using a temperature sensor, not a mercury-in-glass thermometer. The temperature sensor must satisfy the detailed requirements of ASTM D 86, paragraph, 6.3.2.<br />6. Electronically recording the temperatures achieved at prescribed points in the distillation process and automatically correcting these temperatures to standard atmospheric pressure per ASTM D 86, paragraph 11.3. <br />7. Storing all results from previous 10 distillation analyses in instrument memory.<br />8. Cooling the distillation flask heating area to prepare the instrument for next use.<br />9. Achieving repeatability prescribed in the test method. In other words, when the same sample is analyzed twice using the robotic instrument, the distillation test results obtained on the first and second test run will differ by no more than the limits specified in ASTM method D 86, paragraph 13.1.1 and in mandatory Annex A1 to the test method.</p>

The NAICS code is 334516.</p>
<p>(v)/(vi) STATEMENT OF WORK for Thermal Stability Analyzer</p>
<p>Equipment Functional Requirement: Stand-alone system not only capable of achieving the Critical Operating Characteristics identified in ASTM International test procedure D 3241, Table 2, but more specifically, capable of automatically accomplishing a group of critical tasks. Two of these critical tasks which the instrument must accomplish in automated fashion are specified in ASTM International test procedure D 3241, paragraphs 11.4.3 (checking fuel flow rate) and 11.5.1 (recording filter pressure drop). A third critical task is automatic shutdown of the instrument when the test concludes under standard conditions. This task is referred to in D 3241, paragraph 11.7.2. Final critical task is safety related. The instrument must automatically cut off the flow of fuel in the event of a loss of system integrity. To state the requirement in alternate terms, if, for example an operator inadvertently strikes the tubing downstream of the test filter and dislodges it, the instrument must not continue to pump fuel onto the workbench and ultimately onto the floor. In combination, automation of these 4 critical tasks allows a single operator to start a thermal stability analysis using the instrument and then move on to conduct of other laboratory operations.</p>
<p>Equipment Utilities Requirement: Each instrument shall be powered by 230V, 50 Hertz electrical power. No other utilities shall be required.</p>
<p>Equipment Dimensions: Depth of the instrument shall not exceed 23" to allow bench-top placement of the unit. Footprint of the instrument shall not exceed 530 square inches in order to conserve bench space.</p>
<p>*http://www.astm.org/DATABASE.CART/D.htm<br />ASTM, as publisher of these consensus test procedures, is the source<br />that potential test equipment vendors should contact to obtain copies of<br />each procedure.</p>

<DESC>Contractor must deliver licenses by June 18th, 2012. This solicitation is a sole source acquisition notice for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has a requirement for annual FLOW-3D licenses.  This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Request for Quotation to Flow Science, Inc., Santa Fe, NM for the following:Item 1: Leased license for three solver tokens, including maintenance service, for FLOW-3D computational fluid dynamics software. Period of Performance: July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013. Item 2: Leased license for one standard solver token and fifteen rank tokens for the distributed memory version of FLOW-3D known as FLOW-3D/MP. Period of Performance: July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013. Flow Science is the only source of the FLOW-3D software. FLOW-3D software is currently used for thermal flow modeling in support of the Launch Services Program. NASA has designed and developed models and processes using the FLOW-3D software. It is in the best interest of the Government to procure the FLOW-3D licenses from Flow Science, Inc. The acquisition of any other software would entail unacceptable risk to the program by introducing incompatibilities with existing data, simulations, models and processes that would require years of redevelopment and would impact launch schedules. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their quotation and detailed capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact no later than 10:00am EST time on May 17, 2012. Such detailed capabilities and qualifications must demonstrate in writing the ability to meet this requirement and will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Questions must be received in writing (email) by 10:00 a.m. EST on May 9, 2012, to the identified point of contact. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 57. In accordance with FAR 19.502-1(2), this acquisition is set aside for small business. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 511210, 500 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status forthis procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Offers for the items(s) described above are due by 10:00am EST on May 17, 2012 via email to maile.t.krienke@nasa.gov. Offers must include solicitation number, FOB destination to KSC, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD-12-042 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-58. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541511 with a size standard of $25M. However, this solicitation is set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to procure on a sole source basis with TJP Software Services - 1574 Autumn View Lane - Howell, MI 48843-7688 to provide computer support services/consultation to meet the research, clinical and administrative goals of the Perinatology Research Branch (PRB). The computer support services are needed on a part-time basis for a total of 600 hours with the period of performance of one full calendar year. The support services are required on-site at the PRB location. The services needed are "hands on" and cannot be done over the phone or wait for personnel to arrive on-site. Office space will not be provided by the PRB. The PRB is located at Hutzel Women's Hospital/Detroit Medical Center, 3990 John R. Street - Detroit, MI 48201. <br />See attached Statement of Work (S.O.w.) and Network Application Attachments for further information.<br />Services to include but not limited to: (1) CLINICAL DATABASE: Develop, document, maintain and update a computerized unified patient medical record data management systems to track patients and data, etc. (2) GRAPHICS REQUIREMENTS: Provide high quality diagnostic images from ultrasound , MRI, CT and other modalities contained in the clinical data base, etc (3) ADMINISTRATIVE DATABASE: Develop, document, maintain and update procedures and guidelines (with input from Project Manager) for an administrative database, etc and (4) OTHER SERVICES: Provide technical support guidance and problem resolution and installation for hardware and software for computer systems and network application. Design, document and implement custom applications and hardware configurations for PRB user needs as assessed. Train PRB and Contract personnel in use of software and statistical programs relevant to PRB goals, etc.
<p>TJP Software has been providing part time computer services/consulting in support of the PRB computer network, hardware and databases. The PRB has its own network, servers, storage, tape backups and other infrastructure. The PRB has highly technical requirements to accommodate the storage of ultrasound images, interface with the hospitals electronic medical records, coordination of clinical and specimen databases, computer support for lab equipment and general desktop support for all the PRB computers. Since we are off campus, all of these services are procured from vendors in a close proximity to the PRB. Given the complexity of the existing network and infrastructure and the vendor's already established technical relationships with Wayne State University and Detroit Medical Center (where the PRB is housed), it would require significant time, effort and expense before another vendor could be in a position to provide these services, resulting in a duplication of work/effort. This situation could lead to delay of services and could cause PRBs work stoppage/delay on certain programs or research. <br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations however, all responses received, within 15 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. <br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the provision of FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items with its offer. The provisions of FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items; FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; and FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions applies to this acquisition. The offeror must include their Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the certification of business size. The clauses are available in full text at http://www.acquisition.gov/far. Interested vendors capable of furnishing the government with the service specified in this synopsis must submit two (2) copies of their quotation/proposal to the ADDRESS LISTED BELOW if responding via postal mail or other mailing services.

It provides protection to the pylon leading edge against ice and rain when the lower pylon was translated down. The De-ice Boot has a heating element in it to prevent ice buildup. The de-ice feature and special &lsquo;glove' fit of the boot around the lower pylon allows the lower radome to translate up and down without getting stuck.

If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. HQ Army Material Command, Office of Command Counsel, 9301 Chapek Rd, Room 2-1SE3401, Ft.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract. 
Federal Government employees, unions or installations are not considered interested parties for the purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest. 
Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated.?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. Time for filing any document expires at 4:30 PM (EST) on the given day.?	Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

?	Required information: Protests must be signed by an authorized representative of the protester. o	Protester?s name o	Address o	Telephone number o	Fax number o	Solicitation or contract number o	Identity of the contracting activity and the contracting officer?s name o	Detailed statement of all legal and factual grounds for protest (mere disagreement with the decisions of contracting officers does not constitute grounds for protest) o	Copies of all relevant documents o	Request for a ruling o	Request for relief<BR><BR>?

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities. 

For good cause shown, the HQAMC protest decision authority may grant extensions of time for filing the administrative report and for the issuance of the written decision. When such an extension is granted, the protester and all interested parties shall be notified within one working day of the decision to grant the extension.?	Remedies: The HQAMC protest decision authority may grant any one or combination of the following remedies: o	Terminate the contract o	Recompete the requirement o	Issue a new solicitation o	Refrain from exercising options under the contract o	Award a contract consistent with statute and regulation o	Pay appropriate costs as stated in FAR 33.102(b)(2) o	Other remedies as the HQAMC protest decision authority determines necessary to correct a defect.<BR><BR>?	Protests before award: When a protest is filed with HQAMC prior to award, a contract may not be awarded unless authorized by the HQAMC director of contracting, in accordance with FAR 33.103(f). ?	Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<CONTACT>DEBORAH W WORRELLS, Phone 304-256-3389, Fax 304-256-3350, Email worrells.deborah@dol.gov
<DESC>ANSWERS TO ALL QUESTIONS
<p>Under 1.3.6 - Can the Gov't provide any indication of its expectation of total price and/or level of effort in staff hours? No expectation of price can be given nor level of effort in staff hours.</p>
<p>Under 1.3.5 - The RFP describes "Coal mines" as an acceptable place of performance, but the remainder of the RFP describes "mines," in general. Is this scope limited to coal mines, or inclusive of all mines (e.g., Coal/ metal and non-metal/aggregates, Surface mines/underground mines, minerals processing/ coal preparation plants/loading facilities, marine facilities/mills/surface materials handling, refuse facilities/impoundments/fresh water dams)? Coal mines only.</p>
<p>Under 1.3.11.1.7 - Can Government confirm whether consultants in the mining industry would be considered conflicted as study team members, due to relationships with industry clients? No</p>
<p>Under 1.3.11.1.7 - Can Government confirm whether owners/operators of mines would be considered conflicted as study team members? No</p>
<p>Under 1.3.12 - Is the $10,000 travel budget limit a hard constraint or a planning figure? This is a planning figure only.</p>
<p>Para 1.0 describes the NIOSH model as "too cumbersome." Can MSHA elaborate on the cumbersome aspects of the NIOSH model? The NIOSH model is very thorough and elaborate. As part of the study, 20% of those polled in case studies thought the overall process and models to be less than adequate and 40 % thought that it was only adequate. The fact that this process and associated tools are not widely used indicates that they are too cumbersome for daily use. A more simplified model and associated tools is desired, such that they are attractive for regular use by the mining industry, for risk assessment relative to major mine accidents/disasters.</p>
<p>Para 1.0 mentions a "Holistic Gap Analysis." Are the results of the gap analysis available? The results are not published, and are only available now for MSHA internal use.</p>
<p>Para 1.3.8 describes personnel qualifications. Can these qualifications be met via a subcontractor? Yes, but we do not want this to be a pass-through contract, where the contractor only performs administrative duties, and has all other work performed by subcontractors.</p>
<p>Para 1.3.10 describes Key Personnel. Can these qualifications be met via a subcontractor? Yes, but see above answer for elaboration.</p>
<p>Para 1.0 recommends use of a risk model by MSHA and industry on a daily basis. Does MSHA intend to prescribe daily model usage of the resultant model by owners/operators of mines? MSHA intends to offer the results as an aid to improve industry preparedness and response. There is no intent, at this time, to prescribe usage.</p>
<p>Are there companies or independent Subject Matter Experts that have supported similar work at MSHA in the past? If so could we obtain their information? Risk assessment has only been studied by NIOSH. No work has been performed, to the best of our knowledge, on readiness models or tools. Contact NIOSH for IC 9508.</p>
<p>Will this work be performed out of Arlington VA or Pittsburg PA? Both</p>
<p>Have mines been identified for the initial rollout of the program? If so who? No, testing has been removed and will be identified at a later date.</p>
<p>Would MSHA like to leverage the previously developed NIOSH models? Yes</p>
<p>Who is the incumbent? There is no incumbent.</p>
<p>What is the historical level of effort on this task if previously performed? NIOSH has done previous work on risk assessment, see above.</p>
<p>Does the government desire a breakout of ODC for deliverables or does it wish only to see the aggregate FFP plus allowable Travel NTE $10K? Pricing should be submitted as per task. The Government will make payments by task.</p>
<p>What percentage of time does the government expect will be spent working on/in government facilities? Less than 5 %</p>
<p>Aside from site surveys and work observations, does the government have specific additional tasks the vendor must perform on/in government facilities? At the end of the contract, we would like a presentation to be made to top staff in Arlington.</p>
<p>Will the government allow video and/or audio recordings to be used to collect data? Yes, if permission is obtained from interview subjects and/or mine management.</p>
<p><br />Does the government anticipate requiring a certified project manager to manage this task? Certification is not anticipated/</p>
<p>Will the government please provide its job description of the key personnel identified as Senior Developer? Senior developers are professionals with at least five to seven years of work experience, who act as primary developers and team leaders.</p>
<p>Will verfication and validation of the requested models be required? Models should be developed to be valid; however, verification testing will be conducted at a later date.</p>
<p>Will the models be accredited by MSHA? MSHA does not have a mechanism for accreditation of these models.</p>
<p>THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF THE PAST PERFORMANCE LIST HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO MAY 11 AT 4:00PM.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QUESTIONAIRES ARE DUE MAY 16 AT 4:00PM.&nbsp; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION DATE HAS BEEN CHANGED TO MAY 18 AT 4:00PM.&nbsp;</p>

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:
     (i) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY OF THE ITEM TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT    (ii) ABILITY TO MEET REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE(S) AND FOB TERMS   (iii) PRICE	
Ability to meet both technical capability and the ability to meet the required delivery schedule represent MINIMUM criteria for acceptable award.  Failure to meet one of these two criteria shall render the offer to be technically unacceptable and not considered for award. 
Offeror's commercial product brochures or technical information shall be used to make a determination of whether the offeror meets the technical capability requirements.  Offerors shall, therefore, provide information that clearly demonstrates their ability to meet the technical capability requirements.
The Government's required delivery schedule/date(s) is 31 May, 20 Aug and 25 Sept 2012.  Ability to meet the stated required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms shall be demonstrated by the offeror's submission of a signed offer which has not taken exception to the required delivery schedule/date or place of delivery.  Offers which take exception and do not meet the stated Government required delivery schedule/date(s) and FOB terms may be determined to be unacceptable and not considered for award.
Award will be made to that responsible offeror which meets both of the above minimum technical and schedule requirements and offers the lowest price. 
(b)  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

Therefore, any subsequent protest to GAO must be filed within 10 days of knowledge of initial adverse agency action.<BR><BR>252.212-7001 (Deviation) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items<BR><BR>252.243-7001 Levies on Contract Payments<BR><BR>NON-NAVY OWNED CRANES

<DESC>NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE OFFERORS: The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate is hereby notifying vendors that, after further review, the suspension on the evaluation of white papers submitted in response to this announcement has been lifted. However, prospective vendors should be aware that, as a result of drastic budget reductions in FY 2012, the total estimated amount available for awards under BAA 12-002 has been significantly reduced to $287,000. Further, as a consequence of the reduced program budget, Technical Focus Areas 2 and 4 have been eliminated from the BAA. Amendment 00004 to BAA 12-002 revises the BAA to perform the following actions: (1) reduction of Technical Focus Areas from 4 to 2 with the elimination of TFA 2 and 4, and (2) make adjustments to the language of the BAA. A summary of the Amendment's changes is attached. (See Attachment Amendment 00004 to BAA 12-002). A conformed copy of the BAA that incorporates the Amendment's changes is also attached. (See Attachment Revised Chem_FP_BAA 12-002.docx)

<p>Due to a clerical error, the Amendment 0001 update posted to FBO on 4MAY2012 included an unofficial version of the document titled KC-46 RFP Revision Dated 5 May 2012.pdf. This document lacked the effective date in box 3 of the SF 30.</p>
<p>This update is to provide the official version of Amendment 0001, document KC-46 RFP Revision Dated 5 May 2012.pdf.

<DESC>The U.S. Army, Product Manager, Robotic and Unmanned Sensors, Aberdeen Proving Grounds MD (PM RUS) is issuing a request for information (RFI) relative to aerial sensor payloads with High Definition Electro-Optic/Infrared (HD EO/IR) capability, Laser Designator (LD), Eyesafe Laser Rangefinder (ELRF) and precision Target Location Accuracy (TLA) in support of forthcoming programs. <br><br>The response to this RFI will be used to maintain the relevance of aerial sensor programs under PM RUS in the context of current and future requirements. This RFI will serve to identify potential sources for the development and production of the high definition Electro-Optic/Infrared and Image Intensified sensor system with, multi-spectral/multi-band/multi-function laser designator and laser rangefinder Target Location Accuracy (CE/LE 90) capability suitable for integration onto manned and unmanned platforms. It will also serve to identify the industry experience, state-of-the-art technology, and manufacturing capability that are currently available or will be available within the next six months. Information obtained will be used to facilitate a PM-RUS Aerial EO/IR Sensor Payload Industry Day on 05 June 2012 at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD followed by a one-on-one session. Details of the industry day will be provided 1st week of June.<br><br>a.	Sources are requested to provide budgetary rough-order of magnitude (ROM) unit pricing, schedule availability information, Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), Mean Time Between System Abort (MTBSA), and any product literature available. <br><br>b.	System information may be technically evaluated and used for Modeling and Simulation (M&S) of system performance with various atmospheres and targets.  Sources are requested to provide general system information, along with the required optical Modeling and Simulation (M&S) information to include input files (in *.txt format) if available for the following M&S programs: NVTHERMIP, IICAMIP, SSCAMIP, IINVD, NVLRG, and/or NVLASERD.  <br><br>c.	Please highlight video output formats, laser wavelengths & capabilities, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)-to-gimbal accuracy errors, command and control protocols, and Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP).  Systems will be evaluated against the current and future operational requirements of the US Army. <br><br>This RFI is for planning purposes only; this is not a request for Quotations or Proposals. No solicitation document exists and a formal solicitation may or may not be issued by the Government as a result of the responses to this RFI. The Government will not be liable for payment of any response preparation expenses. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. <br><br>Scope of Effort<br> <br>The Government desires to enter a Cost Plus Incentive Fee (CPIF) development contract with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) production options for the capability described below. Production of HD EO/IR systems shall commence within 18 months of contract award and systems shall be upgradable to a precision TLA capability NLT FY17. Qualified vendors shall have an existing product that meets performance requirements or an objective program path that will meet requirements within 6 months (Unclassified requirements see Attachments 1 & 2, for Classified requirements see note below). Qualified vendors shall also have sufficient production capacity to meet production quantities. The response must include a short introductory technical description of the proposed system/technologies to be employed and how this approach will meet the payload requirements that are listed in the attachment. Additional documentation such as formal test results and assessments from a Government test agency, product descriptions, and previous contract performance may be appended. <br><br>Description of Sensor/System Capability <br><br>This sensor shall be capable of being integrated onto Manned and Unmanned Aircraft. The sensor will require an LD, ELRF, Laser Target Marker (LTM), and Laser Spot Tracker (LST), as well as an Image Intensified (I2) imager. The Electro Optic/Infrared/Image Intensified/Laser Designator/Laser Rangefinder (EO/IR/I2/LD/LRF) system (MIL STD-810F/G and 461E/F compliant) with High Definition Electro-Optic/Infrared capability (minimum requirement of 720p output resolution) with overall mission area support to perform tactical level reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition and attack throughout the full spectrum of Army and Joint operations. The Electro-Optic (EO) sensor will provide high definition imagery during high light conditions in color and be capable of black and white imagery when selected by the operator.  The Image Intensified (I2) sensor will provide imagery during low light conditions in the spectral band between 650-900nm that can be fused with EO/IR imagery when selected by the operator.  An Infra Red (IR) sensor will provide high definition imagery day and night. The ELRF will provide accurate target location accuracy (CE/LE 90) and allow a first round fire for effect. It provides the ability to accurately range and designate for precision guided munitions and reporting of target locations. The LTM will provide a capability to quickly cue or conduct target handover to personnel equipped with I2 devices.

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. General Statement of Contract Purpose<br />The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination, and implementation of international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State (DOS). Since 2002, INL's Afghanistan/Pakistan Program Office (INL/AP) through its in-country presence at the Narcotics Affairs Sections (NAS) at US Embassy Islamabad and US Consulate Peshawar, have managed several programs to build the capacity of the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) law enforcement and border security personnel through training, mentoring, equipping, and infrastructure assistance.</p>
<p>To date, these programs have built useful relationships and positive results across the country. Law enforcement personnel in Pakistan routinely face improvised explosive device bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and other terrorism-related contingencies, in additional to standard criminality. Following the deterioration in security in Pakistan's northwest region in 2009, NAS Islamabad quickly and substantially enhanced its law enforcement effort in Pakistan, beginning with an effort to build the capacities of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Elite Force through technical support, training, equipping, and infrastructure assistance. Since then, the program has expanded to include police from the remaining provinces, levies in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan, and other federal law enforcement entities.</p>
<p>Position Elements<br />1) Supervisory Controls<br />The SPA reports to and receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the NAS Director and Deputy Director. The SPA is responsible for planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations. The SPA coordinates and communicates with the NAS Islamabad and the INL/AP Pakistan Team. The SPA's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. The SPA must depend in part on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of NAS. <br />2) Guidelines<br />The SPA is recognized as a substantive authority on overall management and/or interpretation of guidance on program and project planning and evaluation in a specialized area. Therefore, guidelines for this position consist of USG and DOS Acquisition Regulations, and accepted legal principles and theories. In addition, incumbent must be able to determine application of basic administrative policy statements concerning the issue or problem being studied. The incumbent must also consider and adhere to various other existing federal regulations, and the interaction between DOS policies, legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, and other authorization and appropriations in the INL account, applicable National Security and Presidential Decision Directives, OMB Circulars, and Department of State financial operating procedures and policies. <br />3) Complexity<br />Develops detailed plans, goals, and objectives for the long-range implementation and administration of the program, and/or develops criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the program. Coordinating plans with various other groups including international donors, the US Embassy, and the GOP can be complicated. Projects require dynamic leadership and expertise and complex innovation, strict adherence to high-level policy without lower level interpretive assistance, and the ability to single-handedly or in concert with a variety of other stakeholders resolve critical problems and achieve difficult goals that may affect other programs. <br />4) Scope and Effectiveness<br />The SPA completes extensive assignments in support of DOS, INL, and GOP priorities and activities. Assignments are broad in scope and complicated by many complex features and are technically, administratively, or politically sensitive in nature.<br />5) Personal Contacts<br />The SPA works closely with the INL Director, Deputy Director, INL staff (including third-party contractors and locally hired staff), and embassy personnel. In addition, the SPA maintains contact with host government officials, other law enforcement agencies as needed, and international and non-governmental organizations. The SPA works closely with INL Office of Afghanistan and Pakistan Affairs (INL/AP) in Washington DC as well. <br />6) Travel<br />Frequent travel in and around Pakistan is required with other occasional international travel.<br />7) Work Environment<br />Primarily, work is conducted in an office setting and sedentary in nature. The position is located at US Embassy Islamabad. <br />8) Level of Effort<br />The level of effort required over the period of this contract is 100%. The position is full-time, with a minimum of 40 hours per week and based on the core hours of the US Embassy Islamabad. Occasional work on weekends or after regular work hours is required.</p>

<p>STATEMENT OF DUTIES</p>
<p>GENERAL STATEMENT OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CONTRACTOR</p>
<p>A. BACKGROUND. The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) is responsible for the development, supervision, coordination and implementation of international narcotics control and law enforcement assistance activities and international criminal justice issues for the Department of State. Since 2002, INL's Afghanistan/Pakistan Program Office (INL/AP) through its in-country presence at the Narcotics Affairs Sections (NAS) at U.S. Embassy Islamabad and U.S. Consulate Peshawar, have managed several programs to build the capacity of the Government of Pakistan's (GOP) law enforcement and border security personnel through training, mentoring, equipping, and infrastructure assistance. To date, these programs have built useful relationships and positive results across the country. Law enforcement personnel in Pakistan routinely face improvised explosive device bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and other terrorism-related contingencies, in additional to standard criminality. Following the deterioration in security in Pakistan's northwest region in 2009, NAS Islamabad quickly and substantially enhanced its law enforcement effort in Pakistan, beginning with an effort to build the capacities of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Elite Force through technical support, training, equipping, and infrastructure assistance. Since then, the program has expanded to include police from the remaining provinces, levies in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Balochistan, and other federal law enforcement entities.</p>
<p>B. PURPOSE. The Deputy Senior Police Advisor (DSPA) will serve as an in-country advisor responsible for implementing NAS Islamabad's civilian law enforcement assistance efforts. The DSPA will work within Embassy Islamabad under the direct supervision of the NAS Director, Deputy Director, and the Senior Police Advisor. S/he will provide subject matter expertise to the NAS on law enforcement matters, coordinating efforts as they relate to mission objectives, the size and structure of the international police presence, USG roles and responsibilities for civilian policing, developing Pakistani law enforcement capacities and institutions, USG police assistance, and training plans. The DSPA will oversee the development and expansion of INL's civilian law enforcement program. This includes, but is not limited to, coordination with Pakistani authorities, management of police training, curriculum development, training center and police station construction, logistical and security planning, vendor/contractor coordination, and commodity provision to host nation law enforcement entities. The DSPA will serve as the senior law enforcement expert within the NAS in the absence of the Senior Police Advisor.</p>
<p><br />C. POSITION ELEMENTS. Supervisory Controls: The DSPA reports to and receives broad policy guidance and general direction from the NAS Director, Deputy Director, and Senior Police Advisor. The incumbent is responsible for planning and implementing many aspects of organizational and project and logistical operations. The DSPA coordinates and communicates with the NAS Islamabad and the INL/AP Pakistan Team. The DSPA's actions, decisions, and recommendations are reviewed on the basis of results achieved and conformance with appropriate laws and regulations. The DSPA must depend in part on his/her own professional judgment to further the mission of NAS.</p>

<DESC>The following are the questions and the responses submitted concerning the solicitationQUESTION:There is a requirement that says =BFAS350 only: side cargo compartment(s) must be equipped with increased stowage capability of at least 5.5 cu ft.=BF Our aircraft has the left hand sliding door which prohibits the use of a squirrel cheek on that side. We have the squirrel cheek on the pilot=BFs side, as well as the cargo extension in the aft compartment, and can also fit the Dart Utility Cargo basket on the left side for even more cargo carrying capability. My question is does the (s) indicate that it is acceptable to have only one cargo compartment with the =BFsquirrel cheek=BF ANSWER:  
The spec does call for external cargo racks (not baskets), but doesn't specify how many.  The squirrel cheek in this context is considered an internal storage compartment.   Similarly, the spec doesn't really say how many side compartments are required.   The total storage capability offered by this configuration is allowed.QUESTION:  Who is the incumbent for this requirement=3F
ANSWER:  Bristow Alaska Inc.
What is the historical data for these items=3F
ANSWER:  2011-  106 days @ $2362/day; 288 hours @ $495/hr2010-  92 days @ $2271/day; 264 hours @ $495/hr2009-  100 days @ $2184/day;  325 hours @ $475/hr
Where will the aircraft be based=3F
ANSWER: The three main field camps that the aircraft will work out of are Umiat, Ivotuk and Inigok.  These camps are within the NPRA, on the North Slope.  The aircraft will only spend a few days at most at the designated base of Fairbanks.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment #1 is to provide additional information as listed below:
Q.  Please clarify the exact specs wanted for this machine.  I do not believe that "Manual Quill" comes on a milling machine.  Is this an error?  A. Manual Quill is correct terminology referring to the ability to manually feed the quill (the component of the mill that moves the spindle in and out of the power head) with a lever type quill feed handle.  This will allow the operator to feel when drilling exotic materials or odd geometries for which the feed rates that must be input into a CNC are not known.  
Q. Is the requirement for the CNC Machine to be new or used equipment?A. New equipment
Q. What spindle type is required-CT, BT, NMTB?A. Spindle type was not specified. Any of three standard spindles (CT, BT, NMTB ) are acceptable.
Q. What taper type is required-industry standard CT-40?A. Industry standard CT-40 taper type is acceptable.                                               Confirm receipt of this amendment in submissions against RFQ-OH-12-0036.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.

<DESC>It is the government's intent to issue a sole source Fixed Price Supply Contract to Stern Oil Company for oil replacement at Big Bend Project. The Contractor shall provide the oil/petroleum product in accordance with the specifications at a predetermined price.  Rationale for the sole source set-aside lies in the occasion that the only contractor in the region who the supplier will distribute with is Stern Oil Company; and the oil the government intends to buy is non-negotiable as with past experience this is the only oil the government can "refill" rather than drain, clean, and replace the entire lot.  Interested vendors must respond to this notice by May 11, 2012 to be considered.

<DESC>Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition <br />1. Contracting Activity: Defense Microelectronics Activity <br />2. Description of Action: DMEA is requesting approval to award a sole source contract which provides critical Information Technology (IT)/ Information Assurance (IA) /Infrastructure Protection (IP) support services as a stopgap measure until a competitive contract can be awarded by November 2012. <br />3. Description of Supplies/Services: The bridge contract shall continue the current level of support for technical and professional support services, semiconductor foundry support services, systems and network management, computer operations, systems programming, cyber security, access control administration, and surveillance system support for all DMEA information technology, networking, communications, safety, surveillance, and critical infrastructure software, systems, and applications. Services are in support of classified, unclassified and stand-alone systems and networks. Work to be performed includes technical, administrative, and professional services in support of DMEA requirements, including: <br />Life safety systems in support of semiconductor foundry critical safety requirements. <br />Custom application development, integration and support <br />Semiconductor foundry process control systems support <br />Infrastructure protection, access control and surveillance system administration, and support <br />Information assurance, DoD certification and accreditation of systems and networks <br />Computer/network systems support and protection, computer network defense, exchange server administration, trouble reporting, information center support, technical and computer equipment maintenance, World Wide Web (WWW), cyber security, Internet, and Intranet development and support for both classified and unclassified networks up to the Top Secret level <br />Communications system operation, integration and support, communications network support, and video teleconferencing support. Other production support as described in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) <br />4. Authority Cited: This document constitutes justification and approval for other than full and open competition for the acquisition described herein, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. It is executed on behalf of the Defense Microelectronics Activity, under l0 U.S.C. 2304(c)(l), FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. <br />5. Reason for Authority Cited: DMEA proposes to use its current support contractor, FutureWorld Technologies, for this bridge effort until a competitive award is made. The incumbent currently supports DMEA under a contract issued by another Government contract. Through their past performance, FuturewWorld has demonstrated it possesses the unique and requisite skills and capabilities required to meet DMEA's mission support requirements. FutureWorld is the only known contractor that currently possesses the knowledge and skills to support all DMEA systems and operations which include: <br />Life safety system integration and support which includes: hazardous gas and integrated fire detection and suppression monitoring. Contractor staff are certified to work in hazardous environments. <br />Custom microelectronics design, manufacturing and process control application systems support which includes the development, integration, support and interface with third party applications of custom software programs in order to manage and outline recipes and the steps necessary to create semi conductors. <br />Physical security and facility access control systems support, to include: perimeter defense and surveillance of 100+ cameras, vehicle barrier control systems, and facility access verification systems; <br />Microelectronics design and integration systems support, to include: Integrated circuit design and test application installation and integration; custom software library integration; and high speed computer processing support. <br />Custom business process support systems development and support, of unique DMEA specific systems such as Project Tracking System which provides custom financial accounting, tracking and reporting; Contract Management System provides tracking, reporting, data retention/disposition of DMEA contract actions; and Microelectronics Project System provides tracking and reporting of internal and external projects, and project data and configuration management services; <br />Computer network operations support, to include classified and unclassified networks; SIPRNet and NIPRNet connection and integration; e-mail and client/server services support; and general hardware and software support services; <br />Computer network defense support services, to include: support and maintenance of Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS/IPS) support; operations and support of DoD Host Based Security Systems. <br />DMEA does not possess (in-house) the requisite knowledge and/or skill sets necessary to support current DMEA operational information technology and physical security requirements. Even a short term loss of these skill sets and capabilities, would severely impact DMEA's ability to support its critical mission requirements. This bridge requirement can only be met using FutureWorld who has the security and facility clearance and skill sets to meet our critical need for service starting 1 May 2012. No other firm would be in a position to have a facility clearance for the DMEA facility by the contract start date. <br />Additionally, there can be no lapse in the Infrastructure Protection effort performed by this contract. Safety and security monitoring are required at all times for this facility in support of our Nuclear Regulatory Commission license for radioactive sources. Our agency has hazardous sources on site such as Cobalt 60 and Cesium 137. Additionally this facility houses pyrophoric and toxic gases (Diburane, Silane, Phosphine, Dichlorosilane and Arsine) and a number of acids (hydroflouric, sulphiric and phosphoric acids) which require 24ll monitoring to ensure the physical safety of personnel and the surrounding community. The incumbent contractor is familiar with the security, monitoring, maintaining and reporting requirements of our gas monitoring system. <br />DMEA developed an acquisition strategy in December 2011, in concert with another agency to develop contract support for these critical operations. Delays were encountered well into the process, and it became apparent that this agency would not be able to meet our 1 May 2012 start date with any of their available contract vehicles. Because of this turn of events our Agency was left with insufficient time to develop an alternative acquisition plan for our 5 year contract prior to the current contract's final expiration of 30 April 2012. <br />This follow-on bridge contract will allow sufficient opportunity for DMEA to develop a comprehensive acquisition strategy for the future requirements; and execute a new contract action for these crucial services, utilizing full and open competition as well as targeting small businesses. The 6 month bridge period is necessary to allow for completion of a highly competitive acquisition and allows for a one month transition period for the successful offeror. The required start date is 1 May 2012. Utilizing the incumbent, under this 6 month bridge GSA contract, ensures that DMEA incurs no lapse in supporting its information technology and access control and monitoring requirements. <br />6. Efforts to Obtain Competition: None for this current effort; however, the follow-on contract will be competitive. <br />7. Contracting Officer's Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination: I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable based on use of an Independent Government estimate and established GSA schedule pricing. <br />8. Market Research: Market research was conducted in the December 2011 timeframe and at that time there were a number of small business sources under GSA schedule identified. However, due to the extremely short window in which this bridge effort must be completed, FutureWorld is the only known firm which has both the required security and facility clearances and knowledge of DMEA's unique Information Technology systems to meet our current requirement. Extensive market research will be conducted before moving forward with the competitive contract. <br />9. Other Facts: <br />a. FutureWorld's knowledge of our unique foundry processes, which are a critical part of our daily operation. The current contractor has developed a large number of system software applications that interface with unique third-party commercial systems used to execute various processes within the semi conductor manufacturing complex. These applications are critical to the effective performance of design and production activities at DMEA. The skill set required to modify and or maintain these custom applications requires an in-depth knowledge of the equipment, third-party commercial applications, programming language and programming structure. Government personnel do not possess the skills needed to modify and or support these applications; and the time required to assimilate the knowledge and skills required to effectively support these applications, would be extensive (estimated to be greater than 90 days). <br />b. Not completing this acquisition by 1 May2012 will impact the operational posture and capability of DMEA to fully execute its mission. Failures to critical process control systems will not be able to be rectified in a timely manner (due to lack of skilled personnel); thus, impacting support to DOD weapon systems and other US Government agencies that require "on time" delivery of key components to support ongoing or upcoming operations. Critical updates to key computer systems and network infrastructure will be significantly delayed; thus leaving critical data and information systems vulnerable to Cyber exploitation via undetected computer virus' and malware. Failures (or problems encountered) to critical life safety and facility security systems will not be addressed in an expeditious manner; thereby increasing the risk of injury or harm to DMEA personnel and the surrounding community.<br />10. Listing of Source: <br />FutureWorld 5740 Windmill Way, Suite 12 Carmichael, CA 95608 Cage Code: lM7L7 <br />11. Actions to Increase Competition: None at this time. Future five year effort will be competed and it is anticipated that the effort will be set-aside for small business. <br />12. Technical Certification: <br />I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br />13. Requirements Certification: <br />I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br />14.

<DESC>NIDA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Westat, Inc., to increase&nbsp;the scientific capacity of the current national longitudinal cohort study under its current contract number HHSN271201100021C.&nbsp; This increase in work will not extend the current expiration date of the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes to the current study included in this modification are time sensitive.&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased&nbsp;work includes:<br /><br />1. Sample Design.&nbsp; Changes&nbsp;increasing: (a) the number of Primary Sampling Units; (b) the size of the youth cohort; and (c) the size of the cohort of young adults, as well as a corresponding increase in the field staff.<br /><br />2. Survey Instrumentation.&nbsp; Changes increasing the number of languages to be used in the survey instrumentation and materials from two to six. <br /><br />3. Response Rate. Changes in: <br />(a) Retention: To add a requirement for additional follow-up mailings to respondents, and<br />(b) Shadow Sample: To refresh the cohort.<br /><br />4. Bio-specimen Collection, Analytic Laboratories, and Medical-Information Collection.&nbsp; Changes in:<br />(a) Bio-specimen Collection. To add a second collection of bio-specimens. <br />(b) Analytic Laboratories. To enhance the analyses of bio-specimens.<br />(c) Medical Information Collection. To&nbsp;add cancer registries as one of the archival/medical records to access and evaluate short- and long-term incident health outcomes and cause-specific mortality among users of different tobacco products. <br /><br />5. Annual Submissions to the OMB.<br /><br />Statutory authority to justify this procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.&nbsp; Awarding this effort to anyone other than the current contractor would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the Government that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and would result in delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. <br /><br />
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government</span>. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract modification based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>
