<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, on behalf of the Administration for Children and Families, Office of Child Support Enforcement intends to negotiate on a sole source basis for an 8 month contract with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC).  The requirement is for services to provide symposium program planning and development, and logistical support in conducting a 2 1/2 day National Symposium for approximately 450 people in a DHHS/Administration for Children and Families Regional City in the Spring of 2003.   The purpose of this requirement is to provide program planning and development for a symposium that addresses integrated automated systems, successful interstate case processing, and effective medical support enforcement.  Since State judiciaries and courts play a strong role in establishing and enforcing child support and medical support orders, it is essential that issues identification, collaborative planning and direction, interagency cooperation, and cross training occur.  It is critical that this be offered to the highest judicial officer of each State and State court personnel, in addition to the partners who work in the IV-D program and in medical support enforcement.  The symposium is intended to promote effective collaboration between State courts and Office of Child Support Enforcement and its State IV-D agencies and the medical support enforcement community.  The success of the proposed symposium is dependent upon the participation of the members of the Conference of Chief Justices (CCJ) and the Conference of State Court Administrators (COSCA).  Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:  Establish a planning committee which draws from the child support enforcement community, the health care community, CCJ, and COSCA for individuals with expertise to develop the agenda.  Identify issues relevant to the target audience, collect data from the child support enforcement community and health care community to determine the current status of medical support enforcement at the State level.  Design and develop a symposium notebook that contains the results of the data, workshop descriptions and presenters, biographies, and relevant reference material.  Develop letter of invitation to be sent to participants; all members of CCJ, COSCA, and the IV-D community, etc.  Arrange for consultants, facilitators and/or trainers needed for the symposium.  Develop an evaluation for the symposium; and distribute, collect, evaluate, and summarize evaluations for all sessions and the overall symposium.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  NCSC is uniquely qualified for the following reasons:  The involvement of NCSC follows from their role as Secretariat for CCJ and COSCA, which includes serving as Secretary-Treasurer to both groups and thus providing fiscal and programmatic accountability to both.  NCSC has the duty to prepare committee agendas, coordinate meeting preparations, evaluate site locations and facilities, draft summaries of committee proceedings and guide the preparation of policy papers and documents as Secretariat.  NCSC is the only source that will guarantee full participation of necessary parties; the CCJ and the COSCA.  Vendors who are interested in this acquisition must demonstrate in writing they can meet the Governments requirements within 45 days from the date of publication.  Responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the requirement from a technical and timeliness standpoint.  (Capability to deliver services by Spring 2003)  Failure to submit adequate documentation will result in the Government proceeding with a sole source to the National Center for State Courts.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The NAICS code is 813920.  See Numbered Note 22.

The basic solicitation includes clauses, which must be completed and returned by all offerors.  Some of the changes made to the solicitation are: I-FSS-163 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Evergreen):  This clause will allow the government to have three (3) five (5) year options to your contract, for a total of twenty years if performance is satisfactory.  The options are not guaranteed.  Some of the measurements of satisfactory performance will be such things as adequate sales, quality performance, and timely IFF payments.  One of the most important evaluative factors will be participation in the GSAAdvantage! program.  None of the Evergreen options will be exercised unless your firm has posted its contract information to the GSA Advantage! website.  All offers received will have 6 months after award of a Federal Supply Schedule contract to submit their electronic catalog to GSAAdvantage!.  Contractors may now be represented as 8(a) contractors, providing SBA confirms that the offeror is indeed an eligible 8(a) contractor.  These changes are intended to increase the teamwork that has led to greater customer satisfaction and use of the Federal Supply Schedules.  There are mutual benefits for both the contractor and the government, and it is expected to increase revenues to those contractors who earn the right to maintain a contract for the entire twenty-year period.  Contracting questions should be directed to the points of contact listed in the solicitation. 

The Federal Supply Schedule period is continuous.  Individual contract periods will begin on the date of award and will expire five years later (exclusive of any options or cancellations).

<DESC>AFOSR, in conjunction with the AFRL Space Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VS), NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), announces a program to promote the education of future spacecraft systems engineers, at the university level, motivate/sustain related research on targeted technologies by focusing on the development of small satellites (nanosats) or flight experiments, and inspire the interest of students, below the university level, for careers in space.   The primary outcome of individual projects funded under this program is the design, fabrication and functional testing of a nanosat.  Secondary objectives are to foster research in enabling technologies for nanosats and the design of experiments that can be performed by nanosats in orbit.  The AIAA will sponsor a program competition developed to select a small number of nanosat designs, for space launch and operation, from the universities chosen to participate. AFRL/VS and GSFC will work actively with program participants to promote space-worthy design and fabrication needed to prepare spacecraft for launch. See Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) seeks qualified firms to provide assessments to be considered for use as component(s) of the Transportation Security Administration?s selection battery for airport security screener positions. Airport security screeners operate a variety of complex x-ray and imaging equipment to screen passengers and baggage and must also be alert and vigilant in the maintenance of security in performing their duties. X-ray screening duties include a difficult target search task. Screeners must perform duties in varying environments and circumstances and are subject to auditory and visual distractions, work areas congested with passengers and baggage, etc. Screeners must be able to perform duties free of impairment from illegal drugs, sleep deprivation, medication, or alcohol.

Specifically, TSA seeks firms that may provide selection assessments to measure one or more of the following: vigilance; mental or cognitive alertness, or maintenance of attention; visual continuous performance; auditory continuous performance; visual or observational memory; mental rotation; target search and detection; and inspection performance. Note that the constructs of interest are limited to cognitive, and psycho- and sensorimotor domains in applied settings ? exclusively affective, clinical, educational, temperament, or therapeutic measures will not be considered. Note also that this request will be used to evaluate potential assessments for employment selection only; measures designed solely to evaluate incumbents will not be considered. A manual or technical reports that document the development of the proposed assessment and provide clear evidence of validity for its use in employment selection MUST be available on request for an assessment to be considered.

Interested parties should submit a qualification statement, not exceeding (5) pages in total that MUST include: a) brief description of the proposed assessment instrument(s) (e.g. number of items, administration time, constructs measured, etc.); b) narrative summary describing instrument development c) narrative and tabular summary of validity evidence for security screener or similar jobs, including sample description(s) and criterion measure(s), validity coefficients, and adverse impact statistics.  Offerors may submit qualification statements for multiple assessments or assessments measuring more than one of the constructs of interest, however, five (5) pages is the maximum qualification statement length per offeror, even if an offeror is submitting responses for more than one assessment. A Government Team will evaluate the qualification statements received and will determine which submissions meet the Government's need/requirement, as stated above. Offerors that meet the TSA's minimum need/requirement will be included in the bidders' mailing list. Any offeror that fails to demonstrate that they meet the TSA's minimum need/requirement will be excluded from any further consideration. 

Responses may be submitted via email, to paul.casagrande@tsa.dot.gov, or facsimile to (202) 493-1802.  Responses are due by 4:00 PM, EST, Monday, November 18, 2002.

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces the procurement of a construction firm for a repair and alteration project at the Operations Building located at the Social Security Administration?s national headquarters in Woodlawn, Maryland.  The estimated cost range of this project is over one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000).  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the Request for Proposal.  

The Operations Building was designed in 1957 and constructed shortly thereafter.  Encompassing roughly 1.2 million square feet on 3 ? floors, the entire building, with minor exceptions, is to be completely renovated.  The work entails the removal of virtually all interior partitions and facades in a two-phase project over a 3-1/2 year period.  The building will be partially occupied during the work.  The phasing will occur by dividing the building into halves down a north-south axis.  The west half of the building will be renovated during phase 1, which will last 20 months, while the east half is occupied.  The east half of the building will be renovated during phase 2, which will last 16 months, while the west half is occupied.  The contractor shall build a 2-hour rated temporary wall that separates the construction area from the tenant occupied space.

The requirement of this project is for the construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment to perform, but not limited to, the demolition, replacement, and/or installation of the following:  Asbestos/Hazmat abatement, Light fixtures, Roof, Interior walls, Windows, Carpet, Facade, Doors, Plumbing, Paint, Restrooms, Cafeteria Equipment, Site work, Skylights, Building Automation System, UPS system, Lan/Wan/Telecom systems, Fire alarm system, HVAC systems, Fire sprinkler system, Ductwork, Security system, Electrical Systems, Masonry, Ceilings, Pre-Cast concrete panels.

This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The NAICS code is 233320.  The Contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing formal source selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Continuum concept.  The Government anticipates the award, approximately December 30, 2002, of a firm fixed price contract to the firm offering the best value in terms of price and technical merit as a result of this effort.  For this procurement technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.

The acquisition process shall consist of 3 steps.  
Step 1:Offerors will be evaluated based on two technical factors: past performance and bonding capacity.  The criteria and directions for the submission of the step 1 technical proposal are available upon request.  After the evaluation is completed, all firms that responded to this pre solicitation notice will be notified as to their technical rating and an advisory short list will be developed.  Firms on the advisory short list will then be invited to participate in step number 2, however any firm that submitted a technical proposal will not be precluded at this stage. 
NOTE:  Contractors must submit a technical proposal during phase one of the procurement process to be considered for award.  Failure to submit a timely technical proposal will result in exclusion of a proposal from further consideration.

Step 2:A formal RFP, with 100% complete drawings and specifications, and additional technical factors will be issued to all firms on the advisory short list.  The approximate date for issuance of the RFP is on or after May 1, 2002.  The additional technical factors will be included with the RFP package.  Price and technical proposals are both required in this step.  A competitive range will be developed.  Oral presentations and interviews will be conducted with the firms in the competitive range.  Negotiations may also be conducted in this step, however it should be noted that a selection and award might be made without discussions.  

Step 3:Receipt and evaluation of final offers.  Upon evaluation of any and all revised technical and price proposals, the firm who offers the best overall value to the Government will be selected for award.  

To be included on the GSA source list, and to obtain a copy of the step 1 technical criteria stated above, please mail, fax or email your request to Shelia Watkins at GSA, Chesapeake Realty Services District, The Wanamaker Building, 100 Penn Square East, Room 614, Philadelphia, PA, 19107, shelia.Watkins@gsa.gov, fax 215-656-5838.

Reference solicitation number GS-03P-02-DXC-0013 for identification purposes.
The step 1 technical proposals are due April 5, 2002 at 3:00 P.M, submitted to the Office of Business and Public Affairs, 100 Penn Square East, Room 829, Philadelphia, PA  19107.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Twin Commander model AC-500S Shrike, serial number 3261, FAA registration N47RF requires full maintenance support for the upcoming year. The aircraft's primary mission is for the FAA Flight Edit Program and a variety of remote sensing programs.  The airframe has 12,500 hours since new and engines and propellers have 650 hours since overhaul. NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) in Tampa, Florida manages the aircraft. The contractor's facility must be located within the operational area of the aircraft (Central area of the United States). The contractor shall provide a full service, Fixed Base of Operations (FBO) that can support the Twin Commander aircraft. Labor, materials, equipment, special tools and facilities shall be located at the FBO to provide the Government with the most cost effective support package. The contractor/FBO shall provide, flight crew amenities, scheduled and un-scheduled maintenance, avionics, paint and interior, servicing, inspection and repair on an as needed basis.  The Government shall be responsible for scheduling all work against this contract. Once the aircraft arrives at the Contractor's facility, no work shall begin until AOC has given approval for such work to begin. Any additional work or discrepancies must have prior approval from AOC. The contractor shall provide a list of discrepancies/tear down inspection report to AOC.  The report shall include the extent of the inspection, condition found on all major components, outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and any recommendations for maintenance that would prevent future failures if applicable. The contractor will be responsible for all, FAA and AOC required, documentation to include, but not limited to, approval for return to service. A government flight crew shall fly the aircraft to the contractor's facility. AOC and/or the flight crew shall notify the contractor as soon as the need for service, inspection, and repair has been identified. If requested, all scheduled events and required services will be brought to the contractor's attention before award of the contract. Government owned parts, equipment, and property shall be returned to the Government. The cost of shipping the returnables shall be the responsibility of the Government. The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain hull liability insurance of not less than $250,000.00 to cover the aircraft on which this work will be performed.  Before award of this contract, the contractor shall provide to the contracting officer written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained.  The policies evidencing the required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government's interest shall not be effective for such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe or until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the contracting officer, whichever period is longer. The contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. The Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous at any time during the contract period.  The Government will make the final determination on whether new, new surplus, overhauled, repaired, or serviceable parts will be installed on the aircraft. Parts and components in an "as removed" status will not be installed on the aircraft. Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life but fails inspection and needs to be replaced will be treated as an over and above. Since the government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, meet this criteria, maintenance contractors shall provide the Labor rate they will charge the government, per hour for "over and above" discrepancies. PMA parts are acceptable.  The Contractor shall provide the industry standard implied warranty on all products and services. Contractors must provide proof that the facility performing the required services is an FAA approved repair station for the Twin Commander class aircraft, engines, accessories, and avionics. Authorization from Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation in Arlington, Washington is not required. Offerors will be required to: demonstrate that they have maintained or repaired the same model aircraft within the past six months, submit a copy of FAA Repair Station Certificate or Twin Commander Service Center documentation, submit proof of insurance documentation, supply fuel under a pre-existing Government contract, have factory trained technicians on staff, and show the number of work shifts in a 24 hour day (non-overtime).

<DESC>NASA/GSFC plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a two-year extension to contract NASW-4690, for the extended Mission Operations and Data Analysis (MO&DA) phase of the High Energy Transient Explorer (HETE-2) mission on a sole source basis and in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), Only One Responsible Source. HETE-2 is a free-flying satellite dedicated to the study of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) using soft X-ray, medium X-ray, and gamma-ray instruments.	The mission utilizes dedicated tracking, data acquisition, mission operations, and data analysis facilities established and operated by MIT and its Science Team members since the mission launch in October 2000.       MIT built the satellite, and, along with its science team partners, the specific instruments in conjunction with the end-to-end concept they developed for the operations of the platform and for the scientific analysis, b) they established the Primary Ground Stations (S-Band) and the Burst Alert Network (VHF-band) that utilize MIT-developed communications protocols with the spacecraft to acquire the science data, c) they developed the ground data system software to provide the command and control support for the mission, and d) they developed customized software to analyze the raw data and produce higher level science products.      Only MIT (specifically the Center for Space Research) possesses the necessary high level of engineering expertise and experience concerning the detailed design of the spacecraft, the instruments, the ground support antennas, and the ground data system to effectively operate the mission and achieve mission goals.	      MIT's knowledge, experience, and facilities will enable it to continue to provide excellent support to the mission.  It would be extremely difficult for another contractor to provide the same level of support without a major interruption to the program underway, due to the learning curve of performing unique science mission operations and data analysis.	The learning curve and delay would also add additional cost, which is unacceptable to the Project given the budgetary guidelines set forth for this program.	   Therefore, MIT is considered the only responsible source capable of fulfilling this requirement. All responsible sources desiring consideration are requested to fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days of the date of publication of this synopsis to the point-of-contact specified below.	Companies seeking to contest this 2-year sole source contract extension should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis on the NAIS or Commerce Business Daily. Responses to the synopsis received after 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. See note 22.	   The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. See Note 26.	   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.	An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

OBJECTIVE

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) seeks a scholarly publisher to publish a work on the history of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 and its aftermath (hereinafter referred to by the term "the book"). The title of the book is Three Mile Island: A Nuclear Crisis in Historical Perspective. It is a volume in a series of scholarly histories produced by the NRC. The first three volumes, Controlling the Atom: The Beginnings of Nuclear Regulation, 1946-1962 (1984), Containing the Atom: Nuclear Regulation in a Changing Environment, 1963-1971 (1992), and Permissible Dose: A History of Radiation Protection in the Twentieth Century (2000) were published by the University of California Press.

BACKGROUND

Author: The author of the book is J. Samuel Walker, historian of the NRC. He is the co-author of Controlling the Atom and author of Containing the Atom and Permissible Dose. He has also published many other scholarly works. A copy of his curriculum vita is included as Attachment 1.

Book's Subject Matter: The book is the first comprehensive scholarly history of the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. It provides an in-depth discussion of the historical context in which the accident occurred, including chapters on the sharply-contested national debate over nuclear power in the 1970s and on the efforts of the NRC and its predecessor agency, the Atomic Energy Commission, to protect the public from the hazards of the technology. The book offers a detailed account of the accident and the response of the NRC, the state of Pennsylvania, the White House, and others to its potential effects. It closely examines the technical failures and human errors that caused the accident, the uncertainties and confusion among authorities over the extent of the risk to public health and whether they should evacuate the population of the area, and the fears that gripped the people whose lives were touched directly by the accident. Finally, the book includes an epilog that describes the post-accident reforms of the NRC and the nuclear industry, the clean-up of the plant, the impact of the crisis on the public and on the nuclear power debate, and the epidemiological studies of the effects of the accident on public health. Further information on the book's content is provided in the Prospectus (See Attachment 2).

Audience: The book is intended to reach as wide an audience as possible, not only specialists in fields relating to nuclear energy and radiation protection but also a wider audience that lived through or were otherwise affected by the Three Mile Island accident. After nearly 25 years, the accident still brings back vivid memories or impressions from the people of the area and from those more distant who heard about it in a barrage of media reports. The accident continues to attract a great deal of public attention; it has been the subject of two prime-time televison documentaries, one by the Public Broadcasting System and one by NRC "Dateline" over the past three years. The book seeks to correct myths that have grown up about the accident while at the same time to provide an accurate and authoritative narrative based heavily on exhaustive research in primary sources.

Approach: The NRC placed no restrictions on the author in the book's approach, structure, content, or conclusions. The book builds on previous work by the author on reactor safety, radiation protection, and nuclear power that have appeared not only in the three books cited above but also in journals that include JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association (1989), Technology and Culture (1989, 2001), Pacific Historical Review (1990), Isis (1994), and Diplomatic History (2001).

No Copyright: Since the text and the references in the book were prepared by an employee of the U.S. government as a part of his official duties, they are not copyrightable.

SCOPE OF WORK

The publisher (hereinafter "the contractor") shall perform services normally associated with the publication of a scholarly book, including review, editing, design, production, promotion, and warehousing, at no cost to the NRC or the U.S. government. The NRC will purchase 1,000 copies of the book once it is published.

The contractor shall provide layout and typography design and materials that meet a standard of quality appropriate for a scholarly book of enduring value that also appeals to a wide reading audience. The following specifications shall apply to the book:

Length:   Approximately 300 pages (the double-spaced                                      manuscript runs about 350 pages and 115,000 words,                        including notes).

Jacket:    Attractively-presented two-color cover with reverse-type                      white and shading as appropriate.

Typography:   Type style is left to the contractor's discretion but                         right margin must be justified.

Illustrations:   24 halftones (NRC will provide glossy photographs),                            and 1 schematic diagram of the Three Mile Island                               plant at which the accident occurred.

After receipt of NRC's final manuscript in hard copy and/or computer disk form, the contractor shall publish the book, deliver copies to the NRC, and send review copies to appropriate outlets at least three months before the 25th anniversary of the Three Mile Island accident, which occurred on March 28, 2004.

DELIVERABLES

The contractor shall deliver 1,000 copies of the hardback book once it is published to the addresses provided by the NRC.  The NRC will purchase those copies at the standard author's discount and pay the shipping cost.  

FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS

The NRC will not receive royalties from the contractor for the book. The contractor shall: 1) keep the retail price of the book as low as possible to encourage the widest possible distribution to the public, and 2) make copies available for retail purchase through established book promotions.

The NRC may purchase additional copies of the book at a future date. While not a part of this purchase agreement, the NRC reserves the right for future purchases of the book at the standard author's discounted price at the time of purchase.

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE

The period of performance shall commence on the award date of the purchase agreement and expire December 28, 2003.

GOVERNMENT-FURNISHED MATERIALS

The NRC will provide the manuscript to the publisher in hard copy and/or 3 ?" disks.  The manuscript will be prepared on the WordPerfect for Windows 8.0 program. The NRC will also provide photographs, captions, and permission to use copyrighted photos along with 1 schematic diagram.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) is interested in leasing 
approximately 20,278 usable square feet of office and related space 
on a month to month basis with immediate occupancy.  Available space must 
be within a five-minute commute from the Los Angeles Airport 
and must be on the second floor or higher of a quality building of sound 
and substantial construction, recognized as a modern office-type building, 
having fully adequate means of ingress and egress.   An open office area 
which includes approximately five private offices and a conference room is 
preferred and the space must be fully serviced.  Offers for space will be 
evaluated for lease award based upon cost, location, compliance with 
accessibility requirements related to ADAAG and UFAS and the level of 
compliance with the current UBC as described in FEMA 310, "Handbook for 
the Seismic Evaluation of Buildings".

Based upon future space requirements of the Government, the space may need 
to be altered further with additional tenant improvements, which may 
include the possibility of expansion, therefore, the space must 
demonstrate the potential for an efficient layout.  

Please submit expressions of interest to:

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

BAA03-03 (Part 1 of 2)

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:   

DARPA's Information Exploitation Office (IXO) is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development of systems, subsystems, and technology that will provide transformational improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of military command and control, communications, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C3ISR) operations in complex environments. The goal of the program is the identification of areas for potential improved performance, and the design and development of systems, sub-systems and core supporting technologies to validate these performance gains. Proposed systems and sub-systems need not be composed entirely of newly developed components, but may integrate new technology into existing systems and/or subsystems. Proposed efforts should constitute at least two phases. The first phase should seek to establish the technical feasibility of the concept. Phases beyond the first should be proposed as options leading toward increasingly robust technology development.

AREAS OF INTEREST: 

The DARPA Information Exploitation Office (IXO) develops sensor and information system technology and systems with application to battle space awareness, targeting, command and control, and the supporting infrastructure required to address land-based threats in a dynamic, closed-loop process. IXO is focused on addressing the systemic challenges associated with performing surface target interdiction in environments that require very high combat identification confidence and an associated low likelihood for inadvertent collateral damage.

 IXO is addressing the synergies between:

1) Appropriate sensor, sensor control and sensor data exploitation capabilities to detect targets, perform high confidence target identification, to ensure that specified targets (including challenging targets) are correctly engaged without undesirable collateral damage.

2) Dynamic battle management systems, to ensure effective and efficient use of, sensor platforms, weapons, weapons platforms, and resources required for exploitation and decision-making and assessment.

3) Supporting infrastructure, to ensure rapid dissemination, timely processing, effective human-computer interaction, and the availability of suitable threat and terrain models.

Threats of interest include mobile and fixed surface targets (structures, objects, vehicles and dismounts) in all environments: open, partially obscured, in hide (e.g. under foliage), in evasive maneuver and in urban settings.

The challenge of high-confidence target identification impacts a wide range of operational systems and requires development, maturation and integration of new sensor and sensor exploitation approaches with application to:

a) Intelligent seekers to reliably achieve high confidence endgame 

b) Focused identification surveillance automation to confirm ID, and maintain target identity confidence during weapon assignment, launch, and fly out;

c) Local area surveillance to track and identify specific targets while minimizing false alarms, which surveillance is then used to cue the focused identification surveillance; 

d) Wide area surveillance to detect targets while minimizing false alarms; which is then used to cue the local area surveillance, and establish critical situation context; 

e) Dynamic battle management (planning and execution) to prosecute fleeting surface targets in difficult environment and 

f) Integrated and responsive battle damage assessment to evaluate operational effectiveness and guide re-planning.

Dynamic battle management technology is needed to unify control of tactical ground and air-to-ground operations, implement effects-based target analysis and attack against networked systems, and to support overall interactive campaign planning and assessment. 

IXO is pursuing innovative sensor technology to provide new target signature features to enhance target detection and recognition and provide the high confidence identification needed for attack decisions. Sensor/target phenomena that can reduce a target's potential to hide, deceive or counter a surveillance sensor or weapon seeker may be exploited with new sensors and sensor modalities. Technology enhancements to legacy sensor systems and seekers are also being developed to greatly expand their capability for precise target identification

IXO is exploring capabilities to increase the automation of sensor data and information processing and analysis to reduce the manpower and training needed to exploit advanced sensors. This effort emphasizes the application of advanced sensors, sensor modes and sensor platforms to acquire target features coupled with intelligent acquisition of features by multiple-looks and multiple sensor modes.

IXO is investigating command and control technology at the tactical level to automate control of air and ground forces, with minimal but immersive supervision by unit commanders. This includes a focus on dynamic mission planning to improve strike effectiveness. At the targeting level, IXO is exploring effects-based option generation and analysis concepts to achieve precise and timely outcomes with minimal undesired effects. At the campaign level, IXO is investigating mixed-initiative systems to allow geographically distributed planning staffs to collaborate in the continuous construction and assessment of the complex, multi-threaded operations plans required to support dynamic operations in high-threat environments with constrained rules of engagement. At all levels, IXO battle management concepts are addressing the constraints imposed by the requirement to provide combat ID confidence across the full range of rules of engagement.

Sensor, exploitation and battle management systems will achieve flexibility through the use of an advanced computing infrastructure. IXO is addressing advanced correlation, pattern matching, and pattern discovery technologies that exploit relational structures in data, models, and knowledge to describe adversarial networks, organizations, and activities, both in conventional ground operations and in unconventional situations. Agent-based architectures, semantic webs, information dissemination technologies, and reference knowledge bases allow war fighters to adapt information flows to deal with unexpected or unconventional mission requirements.

IXO is addressing these challenges with a balanced program focused on the development, integration and demonstration of systems, subsystems and component technologies and with investigative efforts designed to improve the state of the art in supporting core technologies.

Specific areas of interest include: 

IXO is particularly interested in new and novel techniques to apply C4ISR technology in operational urban combat. Urban environments offer key challenges to precision war fighting, due to the inherent density of urban areas, their three-dimensional nature and the greater likelihood of intermixed combatants, noncombatants and friendlies in the urban context. New concepts are sought to 
1)	provide detailed precision context to support operations in urban environments, including surface, subsurface and internal building features at high resolution  
2)	support precision location, tracking and identification of threat and friendly dismounts and vehicles throughout urban environments using networks of emplaced or opportunistic video sensors
3)	provide sensor and exploitation support for the real time characterization of urban environments to support robotic maneuver in complex urban terrain
4)	support through wall sensing of building interiors
5)	provide new and novel means of isolating urban terrain compartments
6)	provide over watch support and real time situational awareness to forces maneuvering in urban environments
7)	support precision direct and indirect fires in urban environments
8)	provide tracking of individuals and dismounts in urban environments  across a distributed network of emplaced or preexisting video cameras with non-overlapping fields of view
9)	provide precise geolocation of threat communications systems in urban environments
10)	provide command and control to mixed robotic, teleoperated and manned forces in urban environments and
11)	support other novel applications of C4ISR technology in an urban context for peacekeeping, unconventional combat and conventional combat.

IXO is interested in innovative technologies and tools for lightweight planning, course of action analysis, plan representation and plan refinement, with particular emphasis on application to distributed, highly maneuverable land combatants, light infantry, airborne and air assault operations and application supporting special operations forces missions.

IXO is interested in innovative technologies and tools to support the planning, collection management, dynamic tasking, synchronization of organic, tactical, theater and national intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems. Interests include innovative mechanisms for identifying and representing commander?s intent, collection requirements, asset capabilities, availabilities and supporting resources, sensor models, and performing optimal assignment of actors to tasks. IXO is particularly interested in systems for rapid, dynamic re-planning across the full spectrum of available collectors, with further emphasis on active sensing approaches that seek to resolve uncertainty through increasing refined dynamic collection replanning. IXO is particularly interested in system concepts that jointly plan, synchronize and manage ISR and strike capabilities together to improve response performance in time-sensitive engagements.

IXO is interested in advanced concepts, approaches, techniques and tools for the network-centric engagement of time sensitive and evasive targets. Approaches of interest to IXO will enable use of multiple networked sensors across a distributed battle space to collaborate and fuse sensor information, distributed over tactical networks, to localize, identify and track targets of interest. Network-centric approaches may consider the complex interaction of sensors, platforms, communications, command and control systems, and network enabled weapons to provide new engagement capabilities. Concepts of interest may focus on radar (SAR or GMTI), ELINT, SIGINT, COMINT, video, EO/IR, MSI/HSI or other sensor phenomenology.

 IXO is interested in innovative technologies for multi-user collaborative interaction in tactical and operational environments. Applications of interest involve distributed collaborative planning, distributed collaborative control of forces, distributed situational awareness, distributed collaborative sensor data exploitation and others. Potential opportunities include advanced visualization, immersive interfaces, advanced human computer interfaces, natural language, gesture and mixed interfaces and other collaboration enabling technologies.

IXO is interested in emerging technologies which may enable a combination of ubiquitous sensing and computing such as smart pixel concepts, plastic transistors and associated digital logic. IXO is interested particularly in fabrication methodologies that may be ripe for limited system level proof of concept brass board prototyping.

IXO is interested in new radar system concepts for application with unmanned aerial reconnaissance and advanced combat vehicles.  Of particular interest are low cost approaches utilizing electrically scanned antennas demonstrating wide bandwidth and simultaneously wide angular scanning ability in the millimeter wave frequency region.

IXO is interested in new and novel sensors and sensor exploitation techniques for the rapid detection and discrimination of dismounted combatants (to include irregular combatants) using novel RF techniques (including GMTI and SAR imaging), low frequency and UWB radar techniques, EO/IR, MSI/HSI, e-field, trace chemical and seismic acoustic sensing. New concepts are sought for low cost, low power, lightweight close-proximity sensing options as well as standoff vehicle/aircraft/UAV mounted sensor concepts. Of particular interest are concepts capable of detecting and/or discrimination of humans under foliage. Human discrimination characteristics of interest include the ability to discriminate unarmed from armed combatants.

IXO is interested in innovative tools to aid in the automated identification, interpretation and understanding of diverse databases and other active data sources by autonomous and semi-autonomous software agents. IXO is also interested in tools and techniques for rapidly capturing and associating appropriate semantic content with large and distributed data stores. IXO is also interested in new and unique mechanisms to rapidly capture very large corpus expert knowledge in machine manipulable formats for use by intelligent agents.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques to detect and/or discriminate small and large vehicular targets under tree canopy. Techniques of interest include novel sensing approaches (such as FOPEN GMTI radar) and novel sensor exploitation techniques (such as 3D radar image reconstruction and rapid wide area change detection approaches). IXO is also interested in new and novel techniques for detecting and/or characterizing targets in revetments, in defilade, and in impromptu subsurface shelters.

IXO is interested in new and novel sensor and sensor exploitation techniques to permit rapid discrimination of both manufactured and impromptu target decoys from actual targets. Also of interest are new and novel techniques to detect and identify targets under camouflage, including optical and RF scattering nets and optical and radar absorbing treatments.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques for tagging, tracking and locating objects, vehicles and dismounts over large areas. IXO is particularly interested in small, low powered, long life devices and techniques, with a focus on capabilities that can be read out from stand off over large areas of regard. Potential applications may be active or passive and may utilize RF, EO/IR, or multi-spectral communications concepts or other phenomenology to designate target items of interest. IXO is also interested in new and novel techniques to deploy small tagants with low probability of detection.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques to identify targets of military interest in stand off remote sensing data. This data may consist of 1-D, 2-D or 3D information and may include real beam radar data, HRR profiles, synthetic aperture radar imagery, ultra high-resolution SAR imagery, EO/IR imagery, EO/IR motion imagery, HSI/MSI, stereo cameras and imaging LIDAR sensors. Of interest are very low false alarm rate wide area target detection approaches and focused high probability of correct classification, low error rate approaches to target identification. Also of interest are approaches to ?fingerprinting? targets through prior-free feature measurement approaches, to permit high confidence target reacquisition. IXO is also interested in new and novel approaches to evaluate automatic target recognition capabilities and in new and novel techniques to establish performance bounds for aided and autonomous recognition systems.

IXO is interested in new and novel sensing approaches and sensor data exploitation concepts to support near real time assessment of battle damage and strike effectiveness. Approaches may include novel exploitation of strike platform sensor data or weapons augmentation to provide a BDI/BDA signature.

IXO is interested in novel sensor and sensor data exploitation concepts for the characterization of engagement zones prior to engagement for the purpose of insuring that restrictive rules of engagement are satisfied prior to weapons release and delivery. 

IXO is interested in new and novel approaches for utilizing UAV borne sensor payloads such as high definition motion imagery to support simultaneous tracking, monitoring and engagement of multiple targets within the field of regard (but in separate fields of view) of an airborne sensor.

IXO is interested in new and novel approaches to provide flexible, high bandwidth, low-latency ad hoc networking capability for strike platforms, ISR platforms and weapons. This capability will enable flexible, airborne network centric engagement of evasive targets in complex environments. Approaches of interest include, but are not limited to: novel antennas, highly-integrated, multi-protocol small data-link concepts, novel dynamic network management approaches, and signal reliability and protection approaches for counter spoofing and operation in a jamming environment. Concepts for novel weapon embedded data links are particularly sought, with emphasis on quality of service, low cost and protocol compatibility with other existing or planned terminals.

IXO is interested in pursuing novel tools and techniques focused on treating the dismounted combatant as a sensor and sensor fusion platform. Techniques of interest include distribution and dissemination of video and night vision imagery with appropriate annotation from soldier to soldier (inter-squad) and across and up in echelon. Additional sensing and sensor exploitation concepts may include small micro sensors deployed and monitored by the individual combatant and advanced data fusion, context integration and visualization approaches for dismount manipulation and interpretation of local and remote sensor feeds in real-time.

IXO is interested in new and novel sensor and sensor application approaches capable of providing very high combat identification confidence when cued to a delimited target area. It is desired that these approaches yield a correct probability of identification in the range of 99.9% to 99.999%. Such techniques may imply very high resolution and/or high dimensionality and/or multiple sensed phenomenologies. Implementation of these sensor and sensor exploitation approaches must be practical for the appropriate class of surveillance platform; for close-in sensing these approaches must be consistent with the limited size, weight power and aperture available on a small unmanned air vehicle.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques to provide blue force combat identification and IFF. Techniques considered should be appropriate for both surface to surface and air to surface applications and should support IFF of both vehicles and dismounted combatants.

IXO is interested in tools and techniques to permit rapid, custom assembly of C4ISR systems and networks from individual components. Such a capability would permit components from multiple vendors to be bound together in a just-in-time fashion to build ?just enough? C4ISR system capability to support current operations. Additionally, such a capability would allow much more rapid technology refresh for C4ISR components, by permitting sub-components of a system to be replaced independently. Potential areas of effort include development of tools and techniques to permit distributed, machine-to-machine semantic negotiation of software/data/system interfaces, approaches to scale and distribute command and control computing in response to changes in operational tempo and demand for services, and concepts and tools for automated system verification and validation.

IXO is interested in tools and techniques to permit rapid dynamic fusion of multiple sensors across a theater (or other extended battle space) to support high confidence long duration tracking of threat vehicles over time. Such an approach might exploit diversity in collection geometry and diversity in sensor phenomenology and performance to maximize tracking performance using active synchronized tasking of sensors across the entire available platform constellation. Tools and techniques pursued may address tracker architecture and implementation, distributed tracking, multi-phenomenological feature aided tracking and dynamic, active sensor constellation management.

BAA 03-03 (Part 2 of 2)

IXO is interested in new and novel applications of micro-UAV mounted sensors for confirmatory identification. Such UAV mounted sensors could be deployed from stand-off strike platforms, fly out into the neighborhood of the target at low altitudes and perform high confidence target recognition, confirm that restrictive rules of engagement are satisfied, and perform post strike BDA. Areas of interest include low cost, lightweight, high performance EO and uncooled IR sensors, image stabilization and reconstruction, sensor/bandwidth trades and tasking and control concepts. IXO is also interested in sensor and onboard sensor exploitation processing appropriate for ?hunter-killer? unmanned air vehicles. Of particular interest are onboard, limited target set automatic target recognition algorithms, approaches for target tracking and identity maintenance and approaches for autonomous search and acquisition.

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques to permit mounted and dismounted  land combatants to process and extract situational awareness and targeting information from networks of both local, organic sensors and theater processed sensor feeds. Sensor data may include SAR and GMTI from small UAVs, EO and IR video from many distributed micro-UAVs and radar, optical and acoustic sensor data from ground robotic platforms, and others. Of particular interest are approaches that map appropriate sensor control, tasking, exploitation, presentation and manipulation tools into a processing environment appropriate for a small lightly armed, highly mobile mounted system.

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques to permit a limited number of operators to direct a large force of strike and reconnaissance UAVs in a mission/task oriented manner. Particular topics of interest include multi-UAV control strategies, platform self-awareness, task decomposition and assignment techniques, mission level course of action generation and analysis and adaptation strategie. 

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques both to permit improved intelligence preparation of the battle space and improved predictive battle space awareness. Topics of particular interest include terrain amplification and interpretation tools, behavior analysis tools, local and extended mobility models, effects based engagement planning and assessment tools, and others.

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques for deployment, management and control of very large-scale agent based systems under stressing environments. Approaches are sought to enable agent-based systems to rapidly scale with demand, to permit recovery from loss of portions of the underlying network and data infrastructure, and to permit operation in the face of computer attack.

IXO is interested in new and novel techniques to permit autonomous systems to negotiate the assignment, prioritization and customization of resources, in highly resource-constrained environments. Such approaches are required to operate in highly decentralized environments, and provide satisfying solutions under hard schedule constraints. IXO is particularly interested in approaches that scale manageably with very large problems, where information is distributed, and varies in fidelity as a function of proximity to the agent.

IXO is interested in new and novel customizable and composable tools and techniques to support the rapid co-design of systems and software for real time embedded C4ISR systems. IXO is also interested in the development of flexible middleware to support composition of complex embedded systems while managing interrelationships and side effects among assembled software components. 

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques to permit construction of critical real time C4ISR embedded systems from hundreds to thousands of simple, small computing nodes. Such nodes might be collocated with sensors and actuators or might be distributed across network backbones. Key challenges lie in algorithms models and software to coordinate and synthesize computational structure from discrete dispersed nodes. Of critical interest to IXO is achieving scalability and robustness within these networked systems.

IXO is interested in new and novel tools and techniques to permit synchronized dynamic planning and management of airborne sensors and strike capabilities to engage ground targets. Key challenges lie in the joint scheduling and synchronization of operation and reconnaissance plans, in anticipating and resolving resource constraints, contingency planning and apportionment of reserves, and dynamic plan construction, assessment, monitoring and evaluation.

IXO is interested in novel approaches for sensing the interior structure of a building to  which one does not have access. Potential solutions could include remote sensing, close-in sensors deployed outside the building, or robots that enter the building and exfiltrate data.   Sensors should provide data on the floor plan, furniture, presence of people, and layout of functional elements such as power lines, water lines, HVAC ducts, and other utilities.

IXO  is interested in new technologies to exploit EO and IR motion imagery on unmanned aerial vehicles in support of precision strike operations, to provide persistent sensing and to support  unambiguous identification and tracking of moving ground targets.    DARPA seeks innovative concepts for significantly advancing the state of the art in tracking vehicles and dismounted soldiers from airborne platforms, even in dense traffic and with frequent occlusions; for deriving detailed descriptions of targets on-the-fly, sufficient to recognize that same target when seen at a later time in a different place; for matching such descriptions to EO and IR video to confirm the identity of the target; for detecting moving personnel and vehicles, without false alarms due to parallax of raised structures, illumination, shadows, wind, etc. for searching a target area for noncombatant people and vehicles that could become unintended casualties of a precision attack; for locating targets observed by airborne video to less than 5 meters absolute geopositioning accuracy, and for classifying vehicles by type, based on observation in EO or IR motion imagery.

IXO is interested in new concepts, approaches and advanced technologies to support the development and demonstration of: 1) a new dismount soldier individual vision system  integrating advanced Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) in the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR, 1-2 microns) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR, 8-10 microns) with head-mounted, digital displays and a wireless, high bandwidth, Local Area Network (LAN) capability for image/information fusion and sharing, to replace/complement the current night vision goggles for the individual soldier in urban warfare missions; 2) integrated  image/data fusion software and techniques for non-intrusive dismount information exploitation for the vision systems described above, and 3) low-cost, soldier-carried/deployed and controlled micro sensors (imaging and non-imaging) to allow the individual soldier (squad leader, fire teams, platoon leader) to gather, share and exploit battlefield information in real time, day and night, with other team members and commanders in urban warfare missions.

PROGRAM SCOPE: 

Up to $20.0M may be available in FY 2003 for initial efforts. Multiple awards are anticipated during FY 2003. The amount of funds, if any, for efforts beyond FY 2003 has not been decided. Successful efforts during the initial funding period will increase the likelihood that IXO will make funds available after FY 2003. For Government programmatic flexibility, all offerors should segment their cost proposals as follows: an initial 12-month effort followed by one or more optional efforts. The total effort including options should not exceed four years.

http://www.dyncorp-is.com/ixo/index.asp?BAAid=03-03  . 
After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet Submission, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to the "original" and each designated number of copies.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of your Abstract or Proposal.  If a proposer intends on submitting more than one Abstract/Proposal, a unique UserId and password should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.

Abstract Format: Abstracts shall describe the problem(s) that will be solved, any existing evidence that the proposed solution(s) will be successful, and the relative impact of such a solution(s), should it or they prove successful. Abstracts must address the military context for the offered system, subsystem or technology and must identify the transformative impact of a successful technological development upon appropriate military concepts of operation. Abstracts shall contain the following parts: the Cover Sheet of Volume I of the offeror's planned proposal (see below); a summary, six pages maximum, of Volume I of the offeror's planned proposal (see below); and a one page summary of Volume II of the offeror's planned proposal (see below). All pages shall be printed on 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper; type not smaller than 12 point. The page limitations for Abstracts include all figures, tables, and charts. No formal transmittal letter is required.  Abstracts should contain neither proprietary nor classified information or data.

In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are strongly encouraged to submit Abstracts in advance of full proposals.  Proposers must submit an original and 5 hard copies of the Abstract and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the Abstract (in Microsoft Word ?97 for IBM-compatible, or PDF format on CD or one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA03-03, proposer organization, Abstract title (short title recommended) and Copy ___ of 2.  The Abstract (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/IXO, ATTN: BAA03-03, 3701 N. Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714, in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) Tuesday, December 10, 2002, to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  IXO will endeavor to respond to each abstract within thirty (30) days after its receipt with a recommendation to offerors either encouraging or discouraging submission of full proposals. Regardless of the IXO recommendation based on its review of the abstract, an offeror may submit a proposal and that proposal will be reviewed and evaluated.

Proposal Format: Each proposal shall consist of two volumes, Volume I -- Technical and Management, and Volume II -- Cost. Volume I shall consist three sections. Volume II shall consist of a Cover Sheet and two sections. All pages shall be printed on 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper with type not smaller than 12 point. The maximum total length of Sections I and II of Volume I is forty (40) pages including all figures, tables, and charts. There is no page limitation applicable to Volume II. An offeror may submit more than one proposal. Information or data contained in a proposal, deemed proprietary by the offeror, should be clearly marked. Offerors that intend to include classified information or data as part of their proposals shall, in advance of providing their proposals to IXO, contact the Technical POC for this BAA for guidance. 

Proposers must submit an original and 5 copies of the full proposal and 2 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in Microsoft Word ?97 for IBM-compatible or PDF format on CD or one 3.5-inch floppy disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA03-03, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy ___ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) Tuesday, February 11, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.

Frequency range attenuated shall include the range of 0 - 10GHz.  The minimum attenuation at 1 KHz of Magnetic Field is 35dB.   The contractor must test and certify the shielded enclosure for signal leaks and ground isolation.  The Enclosure must be transportable via forklift. Disassembly is acceptable for moving however must be reseal able. Supply and return HVAC air ducts, which maintain shielding with baffling or wave-guides or other suitable method will be needed. Two brass 12x12 panels, which can be punched with holes for BNC connectors for signal cables, will be provided on side of building with door. One 2 x 30 amp Electrical filter is required, but no wiring assembly will be completed by the contractor.  The flooring must be able to support the weight of  200  pounds per square foot.  The materials do not need to be weatherproof, since the place of destination is indoors.  This purchase order shall be awarded on a lowest price technically acceptable basis.  In order to determine the technical responsibility of each offerors response, the government is now requesting a technical proposal by the closing date of 11/20/02 . The technical proposal shall address all the technical requirements of this synopsis/solicitation. The period of performance has been changed from January 2003 to March 2003.

<DESC>The purpose of this Amendment One to Solicitation GS00M02PDR0010 is to add the following provision to the Statement of Work.


ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST
STATEMENT OF WORK -  ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT 
SOLICITATION # GS00M02PDR0010
GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION
OFFICE OF CITIZEN SERVICES AND COMMUNICATIONS (OCSC/FIRSTGOV)
CONFLICT OF INTEREST


The term "organizational conflict of interest" means that the Contractor (which term hereinafter shall be deemed to include its chief executives, directors, any consultants or subcontractors utilized under this contract other than a vendor selling incidental material) has interests which:  (a) may diminish its capacity to give impartial, technically sound, objective assistance and advice in performing this contract, (b) may otherwise result in a biased work product under this contract, or (c) may result in an unfair competitive advantage to itself or others.   

The Contractor represents that, to the best of his knowledge and belief, it does not have any organizational conflict of interest, as defined in the previous paragraph.   

If, after award, the Contractor discovers an organizational conflict of interest with respect to this contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  The disclosure shall include identification of the conflict, the manner in which it arose and a description of the action the Contractor has taken or proposes to take, eliminate or neutralize the conflict.  The Government may, however, terminate the contract.   

In the event that the Contractor was aware of an organizational conflict of interest prior to award of this contract and did not disclose the conflict to the Contracting Officer or if the Contractor becomes aware of an organizational conflict of interest after award of this contract and does not disclose the conflict of interest within ten (10) working days of becoming aware of such conflict, the Government may terminate the contract and the Contractor shall not be entitled to reimbursement of any costs incurred in performing this contract or payment of any fee thereunder.  Further, such costs shall not be allocable or chargeable, directly or indirectly, to any other contract with the Government.   

The rights and remedies of the Government provided in this clause shall not be exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies of the Government provided by law or under this contract.   

It is recognized by the parties that, in the course of the Contractor's activities, its personnel may require access to or be given custody of certain information (whether in its original or derived form) submitted to the Government on a confidential basis (such as other Government contractors' business practices, designs, mission or operation concepts, sketches, management policies, cost and operating expenses, technical data and similar information) during the performance of the contract.  The Contractor agrees that its employees with access will use and examine this information exclusively in performance of the work required under this contract and for not other purpose whatsoever.  The Contractor agrees to indoctrinate all personnel who will have access to or custody of the information as to the nature of the confidential relationship under which the Government received such information and shall stress that the information shall not be disclosed to any other party or to contractor personnel who do not have a need to know the contents thereof for the performance of this contract.  All personnel shall be informed that they shall not engage in any other action, venture or employment wherein this information will be used for the profit or interest of any party.   

Contractor personnel may be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement prepared by the Government prior to their receipt of any company proprietary or sensitive source selection data.  In cases where Contractor personnel receive company proprietary data directly from a company in the course of performing this contract, the Contractor, the Contractor's on-site personnel, and the company providing the data should enter into an agreement prohibiting the unauthorized use of the information for as long as the information remains proprietary.  The Contracting Officer should be furnished copies of these non-disclosure agreements, prior to the Contractor?s review of the company's proprietary data.   

The Contractor agrees that during performance of the contract and for a period of three (3) years after the completion of performance of this contract, the Contractor, including all divisions thereof, and any affiliate of the Contractor, any joint venture involving the contractor, any entity into or with which it may subsequently merge or affiliate, or any other successor or assign of the Contractor, shall not (a) supply information or material received from this contract to any firm participating in or having a known prospective interest in the subject matter areas for which the sensitive information described in the first paragraph (above) was initially submitted, nor enter into any contractual relationship which would affect or appear to affect the equity and integrity of its recommendations; (b) furnish to the United States Government, either as a prime contractor, subcontractor or teaming partner, any component of any system for which the sensitive information described in the first paragraph (above) was initially submitted, that it is not currently obligated to deliver for defense purposes.   

The Contractor may request in writing that the Contracting Officer grant relief from the provisions of this clause in a situation representing such action.

<DESC>Request for Information for Design of an Interactive Computer Driven Simulation Environment Modeling the Navy?s Enlisted Processing System

1.0 SUBJECT

This is a request for information (RFI) to develop an interactive (i.e. man-in-the-loop) computer assisted SIMulation modeling the business processes among three inter-related Navy groups, (1) Navy Personnel Plans & Policy (N13), (2) Commander, Navy Recruiting Command (CNRC) and (3) Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET).  The purpose of the simulation exercise is to determine impact of policy changes using a systems approach.  The simulation is designated SimPPRT.

2.0 DESCRIPTION

CNRC is seeking information from industry that will assist in the development and deployment of an interactive computer driven simulation, SimPPRT.  The simulation should enable the Navy?s Personnel triumvirate to participate in ?war gaming? sessions to test how proposed polices and budgetary decisions will impact the flow of Sailors through the initial training pipeline.  This should include simulating the impact on the recruit market and the flows through boot camp and ?A? school.  Such simulation games have been widely used to both train and evaluate combat.  To date the application of this technology to personnel situations has been limited.  

Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information:

&#61607; Conceptual technical alternatives for a computer assisted simulation
&#61607; Technical feasibility assessments
&#61607; Approximate cost information (i.e., order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.)
&#61607; Schedule estimates
&#61607; Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to designing, developing, acquiring, operating, and managing SimPPRT.

3.0 REQUIREMENTS

This section enumerates the high-level functional requirements for SimPPRT.  For purposes of responding to the RFI an information exchange meeting will be held for interested parties (see Section 5.0 below). 

&#61607; SimPPRT must allow for each Navy personnel group to interact with the simulation in the conduct of simulated exercises (?war games?) from diverse locations (presumably via the Internet) in real-time mode.
&#61607; In addition to operating in an interactive mode, SimPPRT must have the capability to operate in a constructive context.  This capability can be either stochastic or deterministic.
&#61607; Access to SimPPRT must be platform independent and controlled by username and password.  It should allow users to logon independently or in-group sessions.
&#61607; SimPPRT must have the capability to save scenarios and a replay capability storing these scenarios in a library for future reference.  Users will be able to designate their scenarios as public or private.
&#61607; SimPPRT must be designed in modules that are capable of being run either independently or in concert.
&#61607; The modules should cover the planning process, the recruiting process and the training process.
&#61607; The planning module should model the impact of external events on requirements and resources and should handle the interactions between the other modules to minimize disturbances in the system.
&#61607;  The recruiting module should model the market supply and placement of recruits into the training pipeline with the appropriate quantity, quality and timing.
&#61607; The training module should model how recruiting results along with changes in resources and requirements impact training capacity and affect awaiting instruction time.
&#61607; SimPPRT must produce standard reports detailing all assumptions and pertinent results of scenarios.
The purpose of the RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses.

4.0 SAMPLE RESPONSE OUTLINE

Following is a suggested outline and for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their response as they see fit.

Section 1 ? Conceptual Alternatives

Briefly describe one or more architecture concepts for SimPPRT, including the hardware and software requirements for both client and server locations.  Discuss the flexibility for the architecture to expand the scope of the players and interaction in the future.

Section 2 ? Feasibility Assessment

Briefly describe the feasibility of each alternative and the design tradeoffs involved.

Section 3 ? Cost and Schedule Estimates

For each alternative provide cost estimates for development and deployment as well as costs of running and maintaining the system.  Also, discuss cost drivers, cost tradeoffs, and schedule considerations.

Section 4 ? Corporate Expertise

Briefly describe your company, your products and services, history, ownership, financial information and other information you deem relevant.  

In particular, please describe any projects you have been involved with that are similar in concept to what is described in this RFI.

Include any comments on your idea for the best structure of the requirements for a formal RFP response.

Section 5 ? Additional Materials

Please provide any other materials, suggestions, and discussion you deem appropriate.

5.0 INFORMATION EXCHANGE MEETINGS

CNRC will host an information exchange meeting to discuss this RFI with interested potential respondents.  Details about this meeting will be made available at a later date.  If you wish to attend this meeting please respond to the contact provided in section 7.0, below.

In addition, CNRC may consider meeting individually with interested potential respondents.  If you are interested in such a meeting, please be sure to respond to the contact in 7.0 and make the exchange meeting.

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Engineering Field Activity Northwest (EFANW), in conjunction with the Commander, Navy Region Northwest, plans to offer for privatization, existing water, wastewater, and natural gas distribution systems at Naval Station Bremerton in Washington State. Privatization is a process that (1) conveys a utility system or a part of a utility system under the jurisdiction of the Secretary concerned to a municipal, private, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity and (2) obtains a utility service contract from the entity to whom the system is conveyed or their agents and assignees. As a result of this solicitation, a firm will be selected to assume ownership of the utility system. The successful firm will be required to purchase the existing system from the Government and may be required to provide expansions to the system to meet future needs of the Government. The successful firm may or may not be the supplier of the commodity procured by the Government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system. The Contractor shall manage the upgrades, maintenance, repairs, and replacement of the system to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service connection within the service area in accordance with industry standards. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, upgrade, maintain and operate the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. The Contractor's proposals and plans may become a part of the contract upon the decision to award. Past Performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. No Offeror will be denied the opportunity to submit a proposal in response to the RFP. Proposal due dates will be identified in the solicitation. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: 
1. Wastewater System: The wastewater system at NAVSTA Bremerton consists of the following: approximately 12 lift stations, 48,199 feet of gravity collection lines, 42,122 feet of pressure mains, manholes, valves, cleanouts, air relief valves, grinder pumps, check valves, and an emergency generator that serves 140 industrial and 27 residential connections. The system consists of two sections - onshore and offshore. The offshore section provides pier connections for berthed ships. The wastewater generated at Bremerton Naval Complex is collected and transferred to the City of Bremerton at three metered connection points for treatment. The storm water section is included. 

2. Water Distribution System: Potable water is supplied to NAVSTA Bremerton at three metered locations via 12-inch mains. The water distribution system consists of the following: approximately 168,941 feet of distribution piping, 104 fire hydrants, three water storage tanks, two booster pump stations, backflow preventers, PIVs, 882 valves, 203 industrial connections, and 23 residential connections. Ductile iron and cast iron are the most common types of pipe. Water storage is provided by three above ground storage tanks. The water distribution system consists of two sections - onshore and offshore. The onshore section is functionally similar to a municipal distribution system. The pipes are located underground with isolation valves at intersections and are laid out with a number of loops. The offshore section is quite unlike any municipal system. On the piers, the water lines are hung from the underside of the piers and provide water to a berthed ship. Interconnected to the offshore section the water distribution system serves the dry docks. Backflow preventers are installed in the area of the piers and the dry docks. All the piers, moorings, and dry docks, with the exception of Pier C, utilize a looped water system with isolation valves that can be used to isolate sections of the line. 

3. Natural Gas Distribution System: Natural gas to NAVSTA Bremerton is delivered at eight metered points. The natural gas distribution system consists of the following: approximately 20,820 linear feet (LF) of natural gas lines with pipe diameters between -inch and six inches, 22 valves, 32 meters, and 64 prvs for 39 industrial and 25 residential service connections. 

The solicitation will be provided for download free of charge via the Internet at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil/. Amendments and notices will be posted on the web site http://esol.navfac.navy.mil/ for downloading. This will be the only method of distributing the solicitation. It is the Offeror's responsibility to check the web site periodically for any amendments and notices to this solicitation. The official plan holders list will be maintained on and can be printed from the web site. All prospective Offerors and plan centers are encouraged to register as plan holders on the web site. Plan holder lists will not be faxed and will only be available from the web site. The solicitation, plans and specifications will be available on or about 15 November 2002.

You are invited to submit a budgetary quotation under Request For Quotation number F41689-02-X-0713 to furnish training as outlined in the attached Performance Work Statement.  This request is for informational planning purposes only and is important for establishment of a realistic cost estimate.  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation, or otherwise pay for the information solicited except as provided in subsection 31.205-18, bid and proposal (b&p) costs, of the federal acquisition regulation.  Identify any factors that would affect the prices quoted, and specify equipment and technical data that would be needed to support training (inclusive of stock number, part number, noun description, T.O. numbers, description of manuals and software).  Also, specify whether said items would be Contractor or Government furnished.  For performance in overseas areas, please identify logistical and administrative support required for your instructors. 
	
PERFORMANCE WORK STATEMENT

1.  Scope

a.  Training is required by the USAF in support of an Egyptian Air Force (EAF) foreign military sales program, Peace Vector VI.  Proposed training will be Type 1 contractor training, procured by Air Education and Training Command (AETC) and presented under the auspices of Air Force Security Assistance Training Program.  All instruction is to be in the English language and training will be conducted in CONUS.

	b.  Operator and maintenance training shall be on the Fixed Oxygen/Nitrogen Plant built for Peace Vector VI Foreign Military Sales Program.

2.  Technical Training

a.  The contractor shall propose course content and duration of training.  The training objective is to provide four EAF technicians with operator and maintenance capability to troubleshoot, remove and replace, conduct performance checks etc. on the fixed plant systems.  Technicians shall be provided knowledge and skills necessary to succeed as operators and maintainers of the fixed plant.

b.  The contractor shall provide course outlines detailing major topics/assemblies and the hours required to train four EAF technicians.  Training shall include combinations of formal classroom instruction and "hands-on" practical exercises so as to provide skill proficiency to perform tasks "unsupervised."  Primary emphasis shall be "hands-on" practical experience.  Training is desired prior to the equipment being installed in Egypt (estimated calendar-year 2003 timeframe) so that the trained students will be available during installation/set-up in Egypt.  The contractor shall specify the exact dates the training can be provided.  If the EAF's equipment is used during training, the contractor shall include costs to refurbish the equipment to a "like new" condition after training is complete.

3.  Training Materials

Training materials can be in contractor format.  All training materials used by the student during course presentation will be retained by the student.

4.  Local Transportation and Quarters

For CONUS training the contractor shall propose transportation from and to the local airport, and from quarters to and from the training site(s).  If there are multiple training sites, the contractor shall propose transportation to those sites.  The contractor shall propose quarters for the duration of training to include two days prior to training start and one day after training completion.

<CONTACT>RANDY JACKSON CONTRACTING OFFICER  D7810@DO.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>The pre-proposal package may be obtained from the Bureau of Reclamation home page located at URL http://www.usbr.gov/aamsden/AAMSsol.html.  Reference FY 2003 Desalination and Water Purification Research and Development (DWPR) Program Pre-Proposal for Task I - Demonstration.  Parties without Internet access can request the pre-proposal package in writing by facsimile to (303) 445-6345 or to the email address contained herein rjackson@do.usbr.gov.  Telephone requests will not be honored.  Pre-proposals must be submitted in accordance with the instructions contained in the pre-proposal package and shall not exceed six pages in length.  Pre-proposals are due no later than 01/15/03.  The U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation), is currently requesting pre-proposals for demonstration activities sponsored by the DWPR Program.  Through this program, Reclamation is forming partnerships with private industry, universities, local communities, and others to address a broad range of desalting and water purification needs.  The overall objective of the program is to reduce the cost of desalting and water purification technologies in order to augment water supply in the United States.  The Water Desalination Act of 1996, the authorizing legislation for this program, defines the following important terms (note the definitions are very broad and inclusive): (1) Desalination or desalting means the use of any process or technique for the removal and, when feasible, adaptation to beneficial use, of organic and inorganic elements and compounds from saline or biologically impaired waters, by itself or in conjunction with other processes. (2) Saline water means sea water, brackish water, and other mineralized or chemically impaired water.   For fiscal year 2003, Reclamation is soliciting pre-proposals in the Design, Construction, & Testing Plant & Modules area for projects of 36 months duration or less (follow-on funding may be available for future full-scale projects).  For demonstration agreements, and contingent upon Congressional funding, a maximum amount of up to $1,000,000 will be awarded.  Offerors (other than academic institutions of higher education) must be willing to cost-share 50% or more of the project cost, depending on the financial need of the project.  Offerors proposing to provide additional cost-share will be given greater consideration.  Cost-sharing may be made through cash or in-kind contributions from the offeror, or third party non-Federal participants.  Cost-sharing is not mandatory from academic institutions, but is strongly encouraged.  The authorizing legislation for this program provides for up to a total of $1,000,000 per year to be awarded to academic institutions of higher education, including United States-Mexico binational research foundations and inter-university research programs established by the two countries, without any cost-sharing requirement.  No profit or fee will be allowed.  Patent rights for any developments will be retained by the research partner (offeror) in accordance with provisions contained in the solicitation.  Reclamations state-of-the-art water treatment laboratory and pilot-scale facilities are available for use on a cost reimburseable basis.  These include the Technical Service Center in Denver, Colorado, and the Water Quality Improvement Center, in Yuma, Arizona.  If you need detailed information on these facilities and costs, please contact the above.  Any responsible source, to include individuals, academic institutions, commercial or industrial organizations, private entities, public entities (including state and local), or Indian Tribal Governments, may submit a pre-proposal which will be considered by Reclamation.  Foreign entities, other than United States-Mexico binational research foundations and inter-university research programs established by the two countries, are not eligible for funding under the authorizing legislation for this program.  Federal agencies are not eligible to apply.  Pre-proposals will be reviewed for overall scientific and/or technical merit; results from earlier successful pilot-plant investigations indicating the project is at demonstration stage; potential contributions to Reclamations DWPR program objectives; qualifications of the proposer; and reasonableness of the estimated project costs.  Meritorious pre-proposers will be encouraged to submit a full proposal.  Submission of a pre-proposal is not mandatory; however, offerors are strongly encouraged to do so in order to receive the benefit of the initial pre-proposal screening process.  Solicitation packages for the full proposals will be issued on or about 02/13/03, with a due date of approximately 45 days after issuance.  Brief descriptions of each area of interest and their respective funding amounts are listed below.  During fiscal year 2003, Reclamation anticipates the award of one (1) demonstration financial assistance agreement of 36 months duration or less, with Federal funds of about $1,000,000 for the three year agreement., subject to the content and quality of proposals received.  TASK I - DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, & TESTING PLANTS & MODULES - The primary objective of this emphasis area is to cost share the design, construction, and testing of demonstration-scale systems and processes.  Awards under this task can result from successful pilot-scale investigations completed under the DWPR program that demonstrated a high level of success and proved the technology is ready for design, construction, & testing.  However, any researcher may submit a pre-proposal who can provide sufficient documentation indicating a high level of prior successful pilot-scale investigations have been accomplished and that the project is at design, construction, & testing demonstration phase.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, is interested in identifying an industrial partner for the ELF On Hull Antenna Future Naval Capability demonstration. The feasibility of the On Hull ELF receiving antenna was demonstrated during two previous ONR 6.2 Exploratory Development Programs. During FY03, the transition of the technology from those programs to an ONR 6.3 Advanced Development Program will commence. This effort will involve the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport teaming with an industrial partner to design for manufacturability and build two magnetic core loop Advanced Development Antennas incorporating noise mitigation technologies with platform integration. Successful demonstration of the Advanced Development Antennas may lead to a contract solicitation for production of antennas for each submarine in the fleet plus spares. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, is interested in conducting a pre-solicitation industry brief to present interested vendors with a more detailed overview of On Hull Antenna technologies and requirements. Vendors with the capability to design and manufacture magnetic core loop antennas who are interested in attending this industry brief (yet to be scheduled) should respond to Ray Smith, as follows: Send your Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Email Address, Telephone Number, CAGE Code, and reference N66604-03-R-0541 to SmithRD@Npt.NUWC.Navy.Mil. All responses are due via Email by 30 November 2002.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is conducting a market analysis prior to exercising the Option Contract Period under Contract No. 50-DDNR-0-90030 with Raytheon Company.  The Option Contract Period provides for the lease of a High Performance Computing System (HPCS) for the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) in Plainsboro, New Jersey.  The period of the Option Contract Period is October 1, 2003, through September 30, 2006.  The market analysis is being conducted to determine if exercise of the Option Contract Period under the existing contract with Raytheon Company is advantageous to the Government.  The Government requires a single contractor to be responsible for the design, installation, maintenance, and support (e.g., software maintenance, hardware maintenance, applications analysis) of the HPCS.  The primary objective of this acquisition is to acquire balanced, comprehensive computing capability for GFDL.  This includes not only high-performance computing but also corresponding capabilities for data management and archiving, analysis and visualization of model results, and networking and telecommunications that the Laboratory needs to most effectively advance its research programs.  The HPCS must meet all of the stated objectives and specifications cited in the Statement of Need and shall include all hardware and software necessary to operate the HPCS as a complete, functional, balanced, and highly reliable system.  GFDL requires an availability of at least 96% (24 hours/day, 7 days/week) for each component of the HPCS.   A single Contractor will serve as the point-of-contact for the entire HPCS, even though the HPCS may involve separate sub-systems from a number of different vendors.  The project funding profile for the three-year Option Contract Period is approximately $10.9 million annually.  In accordance with the terms of the contract, the HPCS to be delivered during the Option Contract Period must offer a guaranteed increase in computational performance over the system delivered as the final substantial upgrade during the Base Contract Period.  Accordingly, any proposed system being offered by a vendor under this synopsis must provide at least a similar guaranteed minimum level of performance.  For information concerning the computational performance requirements during the Contract Option Period and related benchmark codes, please contact Brian Gross, GFDL by either telephone at (609) 452-6597 or email at brian.gross@noaa.gov.  A copy of the contract statement of need is available upon written request to the Contracting Officer at william.voitk@noaa.gov  Vendors that believe they can satisfy the Government's requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates an ability to furnish a system capable of meeting the requirements and within the annual funding profile previously cited.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.   A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received within 30 days after publication of this synopsis.

<DESC>Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center in partnership with the Defense Supply Center Richmond will host a Jet Engine Bearing Industry Day on Tuesday, October 22, 2002 at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time, Tinker AFB, OK.  Sign in will begin at 12:30 p.m.  This is an advertisement for the Industry Day only and no solicitation is available at this time.  Any resulting procurement action will be the subject of a separate, future announcement.  The Government will not reimburse attendees for any costs associated with participation and is under no obligation to award any contract associated with this event.  The following information is provided for discussion purposes and any potential strategy for this acquisition may change prior to any solicitation release.  

The purpose of this interactive Industry Day is to identify Purchasing and Supply Chain Management (PSCM) best practices for the jet engine bearing industry.  The initial scope includes, but is not limited to the following jet engines:  F100, F101, F107, F112, TF33, F110, F108, F118, TF39, T56, J85, TF34.  Potential exists to establish several long-term business arrangements, which could result in contractual documents for new manufactured bearings for the engines identified above, with a long range strategy of expanding the scope to include all USAF and DoD bearing requirements.  The goals of any forthcoming sourcing strategy will be to improve readiness and increase the responsiveness of the supply chain.  We desire to achieve reductions in the overall volume of contracts for this commodity, administrative lead-times, and production lead-times to enhance asset availability/visibility and lower costs to better support the warfighters.   PSCM incorporates many initiatives and concepts to enhance material support by integrating and streamlining supply chain functions.  Specific topics of discussion will be linking demand planning with replenishment planning, automating routine activities, e-business, direct vendor delivery (DVD), and other innovative purchasing and supply chain management techniques.  

In order to discuss issues pertaining to the Jet Engine Bearing Industry, OC-ALC and DSCR requests your participation in this Industry Day.

<SUBJECT>65 -- Notice to DAPA holders
<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) Medical/Surgical Commodity Business Unit is in the process of solicitation and award of a contract to a commercial Group Purchasing Organization (GPO). This contract will be an indefinite quantity type contract (IQC). It is anticipated that this contract will generate cost savings as well as improved standardization efforts.
 The contract will be awarded under full and open competition. The GPO will provide pricing at both the committed and uncommitted levels for product categories or groupings. The evaluation of calculated savings at both the committed and uncommitted levels will be the primary basis for the award decision.
 If and when a GPO is selected under this competitive procedure, a Tricare Region, an individual Military Treatment Facility (MTF), or a civilian customer may elect to make a commitment and gain access to favorable pricing to a product category in the GPO's portfolio without going through any further competitive process. Similarly, a Tricare Region, an MTF, or a civilian customer may use the uncommitted GPO price without going through any further competitive process. This is a change and a restructuring of how the DSCP customer medical community conducts business.
  Conversely, if a Tricare Region, MTF, or civilian customer does not choose to make a commitment to the GPO product category, or to buy at the uncommitted GPO price, the Tricare Region, MTF, or civilian customer may continue to buy the items as under the current system, but with the following three proposed changes to the DAPA rules:

   1) Large business DAPA's must offer national prices.
   2) Neither large nor small businesses can have pricing tiers on their DAPAs-unless the tiers result from a Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA).
   3) Small businesses may have DODAAC-restricted DAPA's (i.e.,small businesses are not limited to national DAPA prices).

  Either choosing the GPO's committed/uncommitted prices or following the current process will independently meet competition requirements.
  this summary notifies the DAPA holders of possible impending changes in the business practices of the Medical/Surgical Commodity Business Unit at DSCP. If you have any questions, please contact Joseph Wasko at tel:215-737-8398, or email: jwako@dscp.dla.mil.
