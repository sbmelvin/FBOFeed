<CONTACT>ANN MANNING CONTRACT SPECIALIST 3034452433     AMANNING@DO.USBR.GOV;
<DESC>Description:  The Bureau of Reclamation intends to award a requirement to have a contractor cut all existing vegetation (6 inches above ground) on an estimated 13 acre area at Veteran's Dam, Sulphur, OK (Murray County). The existing woody vegetation is fairly dense and will consist of clearing all trees, scrubs, stumps, exposed roots, down timber, branches, and briar on existing downstream and upstream dam embankment surfaces.  The contractor will be required to make all arrangements to remove, haul, and dispose of cleared materials at off site landfills.  The Government estimates that local landfills are an estimated 20 miles away from the work site.  Contractor's will be required to provide a qualified environmental specialist to assist with a hazardous situation (only in the event) the contractor spills or causes a hazardous situation at the work site during the term of the requirement.  The contractor will be required to submit a resume of an environmental specialist within 30 calendar days of award.  Veterans Dam is approximately 48 feet high, has a crest width of 30 feet and a crest length of 700 feet. The upstream and downstream slopes are approximately 3H:1V and  2 1/2H:1V, respectively.  The upstream face is protected by riprap.  There are two intermediate benches on the downstream slope that are approximately 20 feet and 6 feet wide for the upper and lower benches, respectively.  Stone masonry drainage flumes, located on the upper 20-foot-wide berm, run the length of the downstream slope to collect and convey surface runoff in a controlled manner.  The estimated duration of the project is a maximum of 7 weeks based on date of award. Veteran's Dam is an open access facility.  Contractor's are strongly urged to conduct an independent site visit before submission of proposals.  Electronic drawings of the work area should probably be requested prior to any site visit. (Drawing El. 930 - Clear downstream dam embankment surface between limit of clearing area and dam crest.  Limit of clearing area will be marked in the field by the COR.  In general, the limit will follow the El. 930 contour on the downstream side of dam from the north end of the north parking area to the spillway).  In the event of sufficient interest or need, a formal site visit may be conducted.  Due to the logistics of the requirement, small business contractors shall reside in Oklahoma area. Any firm that believes it can execute the pending study is encouraged to obtain a copy of the Request for Quotation from the Contracting Officer.  All contractors requesting a copy within the synopsis period will be forwarded a copy of the Request for Quotation.  Inquiries will only be accepted by Fax at (303) 445-6345, Attention: Ann R. Manning.  Responses should include the firm's business size [e.g. small business, other than small business] in accordance with the size standard: $6 Million for North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561730.

<DESC>U.S. SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION
Small Business Size Standards: Waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule
AGENCY:	U.S. Small Business Administration.
ACTION:	Notice of intent to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Water Treatment Chemicals.
SUMMARY: The U. S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is considering granting a waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Water Treatment Chemicals. The basis for waivers is that no small business manufacturers are supplying these classes of products to the Federal government.  The effect of a waiver would be to allow otherwise qualified regular dealers to supply the products of any domestic manufacturer on a Federal contract set aside for small businesses, service disabled veteran-owned small businesses or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program.  The purpose of this notice is to solicit comments and potential source information from interested parties.  
DATE:	 Comments and sources must be submitted on or before February 3, 2006.
ADDRESSES:  You may submit comments and source information to Edith Butler, 409 3rd Street, SW, Suite 8800. Washington, DC  20416
FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Edith Butler, Program Analyst, by telephone at (202) 619-0422; by FAX at 481-1788; or by email at edith.butler@sba.gov.


SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Section 8(a) (17) of the Small Business Act (Act),15 U.S.C. 637(a)(17), requires that recipients of Federal contracts set aside for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or SBA’s 8(a) Business Development Program provide the product of a small business manufacturer or processor, if the recipient is other than the actual manufacturer or processor.  This requirement is commonly referred to as the Nonmanufacturer Rule.
	The SBA regulations imposing this requirement are found at 13 CFR§121.406 (b).  Section 8(a)(17)(b)(iv) of the Act authorizes SBA to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for any "class of products" for which there are no small business manufacturers or processors in the Federal market.  
	As implemented in SBA’s regulations at 13 CFR§121.1202 (c), in order to be considered available to participate in the Federal market for a class of products, a small business manufacturer must have submitted a proposal for a contract solicitation or received a contract from the Federal government within the last 24 months.  The SBA defines "class of products" based on six digit coding systems.  The first coding system is the Office of Management and Budget North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  


	The SBA is currently processing a request to waive the Nonmanufacturer Rule for Water Treatment Chemicals, North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 325188, and 325199. The public is invited to comment or provide source information to SBA on the proposed waiver of the Nonmanufacturer Rule for these NAICS codes.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy, Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID), intends to award a firm-fixed price, sole-source contract for commercial items in accordance with FAR part 13 and under the authority of FAR 6.202-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements) with the small business vendor J. W. Bibler & Associates, 893 Honey Court, Arnold, CA  95223-3429. The estimated cost of this acquisition is $170,000 for a period from January 2006 thru September 2007. From 2004-2005, the DOE-ID underwent a significant change in its management and operations (M&O) contracting strategy and structure to fulfill the need of overseeing the DOE Nuclear Energyâ€™s Idaho National Laboratory and the Idaho Completion Project.  This dramatic change necessitated a need to re-train DOE-ID federal employees towards a better understanding of both the revamped contracts and the federal role in administering the new contracts. Mr. Bibler, under a prior issued GSA delivery order with AMCI, worked with DOE-ID management and staff to: develop a contract management training seminar that would enable participants to understand the contracting environment; become familiar with the newly issued M&O contracts; understand the relationship between contractors and federal oversight personnel; and, become knowledgeable of the functions, duties, and limitations on the authority of oversight personnel at DOE-ID and DOE Headquarters.  In developing this training, Mr. Bibler obtained significant knowledge of the DOE-ID, the new M&O contracts and the DOE Headquarters organization and the interactions necessary to accomplish the DOE-ID mission.  J. W. Bibler & Associates, as Mr. Bibler had left AMCI, was subsequently engaged to assess both DOE-ID management and personnelâ€™s success in executing the principles and concepts taught in the contract management sessions. Under this award, the contractor will develop and present a training seminar series to align managers and the general employee population to the DOE-ID organizational structure, senior managementâ€™s leadership expectations, and management and employeeâ€™s responsibilities in aligning to the organization and leading and/or adapting to change.  It is critical for the developer and instructor of this training seminar series to have intimate knowledge of: the DOE-ID organization; DOE-ID and DOE Office of Nuclear Energy relationships and authorities; recent Idaho National Laboratory and Idaho Completion Project contract changes as well as FAR and DEAR changes that may impact these two contracts; and, demonstrated expertise in organizational change and leadership and management disciplines. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification prior to the response due date of January 30, 2006.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to perform the requirements listed. Responses received will be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion for the Government.  If no responses are received, the Government will proceed with the award to J. W. Bibler & Associates.  Responses are due by January 30, 2006, 2:00 p.m. (MST).  Responses shall be submitted via e-mail to surrusjk@id.doe. Telephone requests or inquires will not be accepted.

<DESC>The Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD), National Cancer Institute (NCI) is seeking organizations or consortiums with the capabilities and facilities to provide a resource for the conduct of Phase 2 and early clinical trials of NCI-sponsored agents, to evaluate biologic effects of these agents on their molecular targets, to evaluate other relevant biologic effects and to determine clinically relevant outcomes/correlates.  Major emphasis shall be on Phase 2 studies, pilot protocols that explore promising combination therapies, and high priority studies that are pivotal for drug development and require rapid initiation, completion, and data reporting.  NCI staff will notify the Contractor of high priority studies as they are identified.  The NCI will also consider investigator initiated trials for credit under this contract based on available resources and priorities. 

CTEP requires a total resource that will provide 1600 to 2000 patients accrued to 32 to 64 trials per year.  CTEP intends to make multiple contract awards. These contracts will require multi-institutional consortia of clinicians, statisticians, data managers, research nurses and others with early phase clinical trial expertise with investigational agents in cancer.  (It is unlikely, but not impossible, that a single institution could provide sufficient patients.)  Contractors must be organized to attract adequate patient cohorts for prompt completion of trials.  Contractors will have flexibility to reform consortial arrangements or subcontract with additional sites to meet accrual goals, enhance accrual of unusual patient populations, increase accrual rates for high priority trials and/or provide biologic/cellular pharmacology expertise for correlative studies. 

Offerors for these contracts must demonstrate that they have expertise in cancer drug development, knowledge in the clinical management of specific tumor types, phase 2 clinical trials, pharmacology and pharmacodynamics.  They need to provide evidence of their own expertise, or access to such expertise, in diagnostic and functional imaging, interventional radiology, pathology, and other potentially relevant laboratory methodologies. 

Offerors must either 1) document the accrual of at least 150 evaluable adult cancer patients to IRB approved Phase 2 trials by the investigators (including all sites in the consortium) during a recent 12-month period during the last two (2) years or 2) document sufficient access to a minimum of 1000 new patients in a recent twelve month period to ensure accrual of at least 150 patients per year.  Offerors must also document the completion and reporting of at least two Phase 2 trials completed at the offering institution/consortium during 2003-2004.

It is anticipated that up to eight awards will be made and that the resulting contracts will be awarded on an incrementally funded basis for a period of 3 years plus two additional option years .  RFP N01-CM-57018-16  will be issued on or about February 3, 2005.  The RFP will be available at the website of the Research Contracts Branch, NCI (http://rcb.cancer.gov/rcb-internet/).  The NAICS Code is 541710.  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. Collect Calls NOT accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Northrop Grumman (Cutting Edge Optronics Division), Cutting Edge Optronics, 20 Point West Blvd, St. Charles, MO. 63301 for the acquisition of contractor support to retrofit two lasers for the Rapid Mine Clearance System (RAMICS) with laser flow control switches.  The purpose of the retrofits is to allow for monitoring of the coolant flow to allow the laser to shut off in case of abnormal conditions.  Contractor support is also required for testing to verify that the laser still meets its original operating parameters and that no damage occurs to the laser when coolant is removed from the laser.  This effort is sole source for the following reasons.  Northrop Grumman is the sole developer and producer of the RAMICS Laser Control Switch.  Given the complexity of the system and the level of system knowledge required to modify the RAMICS system, test, and properly update!   the documentation, Northrop Grumman is the only source possessing the expertise, internal technical data, equipment, and experienced personnel necessary to successfully provide the required engineering and documentation support.

<DESC>The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, (SPAWARSYSCEN) San Diego, in support of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) and DoD, is seeking proposals (technical and cost) for research and development in the following areas: 1) electronics, 2) photonics, 3) micro-electro-mechanical systems, 4) architectures, and 5) algorithms.  Proposals for research and development that will support the mission of the MTO to exploit breakthroughs in materials, devices, circuits, and mathematics to develop beyond leading edge components with revolutionary performance and functionality to enable new platform capability for the Department of Defense are specifically included.  In support of this mission, MTO is pioneering research in Integrated Microsystems as a "platform on a chip" to enable revolutionary performance and functionality for future DoD systems.  The core of an Integrated Microsystem is the ability to sense, process, and act on data in the battlespace to give the US warfighter an asymmetric advantage.  Sensing modalities extend across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, truly DC-to-light and in addition include biological and chemical sensing.  Processing is addressed at the sensor front end and at the backend in the analog, digital, and mixed signal circuit domain.  MTO has interest in developing new power sources and conversion technologies matched to the sensor requirements. MTO interests span all five-core technology areas, as follows, with the most revolutionary capabilities resulting from exploiting the interfaces of these areas.  Electronics includes the manipulation of electrons in digital, analog, and mixed signal circuits for sensing, processing, and communications.  Photonics is the generation, detection, and modulation of photons for imaging, communications, and sensing.  MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) is the exploitation of the processing tools and materials from semiconductor technology to build electro-mechanical structures at the micro- and nano-scale.  Architectures cover the exploitation of new arrangements of materials, devices, and circuits to increase performance or reduce power.   The algorithms area focuses on the exploitation of insights into mathematical constructs for data representation, process control, and discrimination routines by leverage knowledge of Microsystem hardware operation.  All of the above examples are expected to further MTO's goal of developing important enabling technologies for the DoD.  Proposed efforts should offer the potential for a significant impact on the current technology and have bearing on issues confronting our Defense and National Security.  New technologies and approaches to these issues are particularly encouraged.  Additional information on the programs and interests within MTO is available within the DARPA MTO web site (http://www.darpa.mil/mto).  This announcement will be open through January 8, 2007.  Awards may be made at any time throughout this period. Such awards will depend upon evaluations described below and availability of funds.  The Government further reserves the right to issue contracts, grants, cooperative agreements or other transactions. Award decisions will be based on a competitive selection of proposals resulting from a peer and/or scientific review. The full set of evaluation criteria (listed in order of importance) are as follows: (1) Overall scientific or technical merits of the proposal; (2) potential transition to Department of Defense systems; (3) availability of funds; (4) the Offeror's capabilities, past performance, plan of execution, and facilities; (5) realism of the proposed cost. Proposers are strongly encouraged to submit an initial synopsis/white paper, up to seven pages, inclusive of cover page, as the initial submission. A cover sheet is to be included as the front page with the following information included (1) BAA number; (2) Which primary technical area(s) (electronics, micro-electro- mechanical systems (MEMS), photonics, architectures, and/or algorithms) the submission is related to, (3) Lead Organization Submitting Proposal; (4) Type of business, selected among the following categories: "LARGE BUSINESS," "SMALL DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS," "OTHER SMALL BUSINESS," HBCU," "MI," OTHER EDUCATIONAL," or "OTHER NONPROFIT" (5) Contractor's reference number (if any); (6) Other team members (if applicable) and type of business for each; (7) Proposal title; (8) Technical point of contact to include salutation, last name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available,), electronic mail (if available); (9) Administrative point of contact to include: salutation, last name, first name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone, fax (if available), electronic mail (if available), (10) total funds requested, and the amount of cost-share (if any); and (11) Date proposal was prepared. The body of the synopsis should include a technical description of the effort, a preliminary schedule, identification of risks, and a rough cost estimate. The initial submission (white paper or full proposal) will be evaluated using a reduced set of evaluation criteria from the full set of evaluation criteria: (1) Overall scientific or technical merits of the proposal; (2) potential transition to Department of Defense systems; (3) availability of funds.  The white paper is to be submitted electronically. The URL for the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central is https://e-commerce.spawar.navy.mil. (Note that this does not include a "www" prefix). White papers shall not contain classified data. The requirements for the offeror's e-proposal (white paper) are: 1) A "PDF" file readable with Adobe Acrobat Reader version 4.01 or greater shall be created and 2) The white paper submission files may be compressed (zipped) into one, self-extracting file entitled "PROPOSAL.EXE" using WinZip version 6.3 or greater (or program using compatible format).  Consequently, the offeror will be notified as to possible interest by the government.  Upon notification, the offeror will be requested to submit a full proposal.   Likewise the offeror will be notified if there is no interest in the proposed ideas represented in the white paper at that time. A debrief will not be available for white papers.  If requested to submit a full proposal, this also will be submitted electronically. For the full proposal, the technical volume of the proposal is limited to 50 pages (Eight and one-half by eleven inches), excluding resumes, and management/facilities information. This volume should also include a separate section of specific task/subtask statements of the proposed work so that these could be incorporated into a Government Statement of Work (SOW).

The schedule should include the milestones and deliverables, both reports and hardware. This volume should also clearly illustrate any technical data or computer software, which will be supplied to the government with other than unlimited rights and should identify other funding agencies for which the proposal has been submitted. The cost volume should: 1) be a separate document which clearly shows the costs of each proposed task separately, by month; and 2) provide Contract Pricing proposal Cover Sheet IAW FAR Table 15-2 (located after FAR 15.408), supported by adequate breakout of cost elements and rates by month for the purpose of cost/price analysis. Proposed subcontractor costs should be proposed in a similar detail. Cost proposals should be valid for a period of six (6) months after the date of submission. The URL for the SPAWAR E-Commerce Central is https://e- commerce.spawar.navy.mil. (Note that this does not include a "www" prefix). Proposal shall not contain classified data. The requirements for the offeror's e- proposal are: 1) A "PDF" file readable with Adobe Acrobat version 4.01 or greater shall be created and; 2) The proposal submission files may be compressed (zipped) into one, self-extracting file entitled "PROPOSAL.EXE" using WinZip version 6.3 or greater (or program using compatible format); and 3) Cost or Pricing Type Data: All information relating to cost and pricing type data shall be included only in the section of the proposal designated by the Contracting Officer as the Cost Proposal. Under no circumstances shall cost and pricing type data be included elsewhere in the proposal.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SUBJECT>58 -- PowerVu Connect
<SOLNBR>HQ0028-06-R-0007
<RESPDATE>013106
<ARCHDATE>02152006
<CONTACT>Robert Gilmore, Contract Specialist, Phone 951-413-2412, Fax 951-413-2432, Email gilmorw@dodmedia.osd.mil
<DESC>Note 22 applies.  The Government intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a contract to Scientific Atlanta (S-A) for the management of the PowerVu Connect database of customers receiving television programming from the American Forces Network (AFN)and the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS.)  This is a follow-on contract to MDA112-02-C-0027, also awarded to S-A.  S-A provides a unique capability that allows authorized customers to access PVConnect, a database driven, publicly-accessible website that provides the capabilities defined by AFRTS requirements for user, trusted user, and administrator level access and control over decoder authorizations, and provides a high level of isolation between those users and the PowerVu Network Center (PNC.) A PNC, is employed at each of the seven satellite uplink systems that make up today’s AFRTS satellite network.  Each PNC provides network management, security, and decoder management and control functions and allows properly authenticated users to have full access and control over each PowerVU uplink.  In the wrong hands this level of access is extremely hazardous to the mission of AFRTS as one could potentially provide, or deny, total access to AFRTS programming to any location on Earth.  Access to the PNC gives one the power to destructively modify the configuration of the AFRTS satellite network and potentially jeopardize access to commercial television and radio programming. The programming signal is decoded for each customer by a set-top box, called a Direct-to-Home (DTH) decoder. The number of DTH decoders is expected to exceed 70,000 in CY2006 and bring the total worldwide population of decoders above 100,000. PVConnect was designed without allowing any external customer, trusted user, or administrator level staff direct access to PNC directly therefore preventing damage to the network.  Key to the PVConnect website is S-A’s ownership rights to the conditional access and encryption systems within PowerVU, which belongs to a single source.  No commercial equipment, hardware or software can be modified or interchanged to work with any S-A PowerVU conditional access and encryption system.  Only one manufacturer, Scientific-Atlanta, is capable of simultaneously providing both the isolation required between the website and PNC as well as the required connectivity for machine control between the website and the PNC.  S-A remains an industry leader in conditional access – a core capability of PowerVU.  S-A’s technology provides its customer’s absolute assurance that only authorized users will have access to satellite delivered products (includes video, audio, and data products).  AFRTS has built strong relationships with the television, movie, and radio production industries who provide programming to the military, often times at little or no cost, but only with the clear understanding their products are protected from unauthorized use.  PowerVU provides this capability to AFRTS.  Scientific-Atlanta was chosen in a formal selection process to provide PowerVU to AFRTS and thusly to also develop and provide the PVConnect website capability.  Scientific-Atlanta does not outsource nor license any of its proprietary conditional access technology and thus keeps all repair services for PowerVU hardware in house.  No other vendor or manufacturer is known to have the capabilities to meet all requirements necessary for PVConnect.

 Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses should be submitted within 10 days of publication of this notice.  Written responses can be faxed to (951) 413-2432 or e-mailed to Bill.Gilmore@dodmedia.osd.mil.

<SUBJECT>R -- Maintenance and Enhancement of the Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System (CCRIS)

<CONTACT>Robin Hope-Williams, Contract Specialist, Phone 301-435-4379, Fax 301-402-0642, Email rhwilli@mail.nlm.nih.gov - Karen Riggs, Contracting Officer, Phone 301 496-6546, Fax 301 402-0642, Email kr33v@nih.gov
<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure on a sole-source basis with Technical Resources International Inc. (TRI) under the authority of FAR 6.302 for
computerized information support services to maintain and enhance the Chemical  carcinogenesis Research Information System (CCRIS).  The mission of the NLM Division of Specialized Information Services is to: (1) provide selected core toxicology and environmental health information resources and services; (2) facilitate access to national and international toxicology and environmental health information resources; and (3) strengthen the information infrastructure of toxicology and environmental health.  The CCRIS database is an integral component of NLM’s mission to provide biomedical information.  As a primary user and disseminator of the CCRIS data, NLM wishes to transition the responsibility for CCRIS from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to NLM.  NLM will be unable to fulfill this component of its mission without continuation of the current highly efficient and effective computerized information services support.

Period of Performance will begin for one year from the date of award with an additional option year.
		
CCRIS (Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System) is an online database originally created by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  In 1985, CCRIS was mounted on the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET) system, and the database was maintained using TOXNET data input software.  The database contains data and results of research studies for over 9000 chemical compounds. The chemical - specific data fall into the selected areas of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, tumor promotion, and tumor inhibition.  Full bibliographic references are also included in addition to specific indexing. 

The Contractor shall maintain and enhance the CCRIS database which resides, and may be searched, on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System. The input for this data base
comes from several sources such as:

- Surveillance and review of the published literature (e.g., CASelects)
- IARC Monographs
- NCI/NTP Toxicity and Bioassay Reports
- Applicable database searches

The Contractor shall survey these sources and evaluate pertinent data in accordance with the established evaluation criteria.  At the direction of the Project Officer, the Contractor shall enter
suitable studies on chemicals into the CCRIS database.

The software for the maintenance and update of the CCRIS database on the National Library of Medicine's TOXNET System will be provided by the National Library of Medicine.

General process for CCRIS record building:

A Senior Scientist (Ph.D.) reviews published literature and results of database searches (typically abstracts) and selects potential studies.

An Information Specialist (B.S.) acquires copies of full reports/studies online (e.g., Docline) and at local libraries.  The citations, with a unique reference code, are also added to the reference file and retained for future use.
A Senior Scientist reviews the full reports/studies and determines if the report/study meets the established evaluation criteria.  If determined to be relevant and acceptable, the Senior Scientist codes the relevant data from the study onto standardized code sheets.

The code sheets and the full report/study are reviewed for scientific accuracy and completeness by an expert Peer Reviewer (Ph.D.).  Questions and issues are resolved with the Senior Scientist.

An Information Specialist enters the data from the code sheets into CCRIS using TOXNET’s SSEUS data entry system.

A Staff Scientist (M.S.) double-checks (quality control/quality assurance) the data entered against the original code sheets.  Any questions or discrepancies are resolved with the Senior Scientist.  

The log of the period’s activity is sent to and reviewed by the Project Manager.  When approved, the Project Manager notifies NLM staff that the entered data is ready for public release.

Monthly reports are generated that reflect monthly activities and related costs.
				
TRI has provided expert information services support, through an NCI contract, to maintain and enhance the CCRIS database since its inception on the TOXNET system in 1985.  TRI has established a strong working relationship with NLM and uniquely understands the utilization of CCRIS data by the scientific community.  TRI’s previous 21 years of experience with NCI and NLM have proven critical to the success of the CCRIS database.  This experience with NLM and NLM’s SSEUS data entry system uniquely qualifies TRI as the only source capable of successfully providing the necessary services.  Therefore there will be no time lost with the usual learning curve or start-up processes.  It is determined that TRI is the only available source with the unique combination of required expertise and experience to successfully complete the above requirements.  Due to time constraints and a compelling need to avoid gaps in the maintenance and enhancement of CCRIS, TRI’s continued service is considered a crucial component to the transition of the CCRIS database from NCI to NLM. 

The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Acquisitions of Non-Commercial Items. This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Sources interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide convincing evidence that they possess the requisite expertise and experience to successfully perform the services as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) business days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposals must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 06-053/RHW.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Robin Hope-Williams, Contract Specialist, NLM on (301) 496-6546.

<DESC>Addendum to Presolicitation Notice:  A Sole Source Award is anticipated.  A 100 day completion period is required for receipt of vehicle at Contractors facility to completion and acceptance of RESET efforts.  Stewart & Stevenson, the OEM, has succes sfully performed the FMTV RESET effort at their Sealy, TX production facility since February, 2004.   As the OEM, they have the requisite knowledge and expertise necessary to both rebuild and reconstitute or make the vehicles serviceable for return back to  the units within the required 100 day time period.   Model quantities, delivery schedules and vehicle conditions are indefinite and unknown.   Assuming a source other than the OEM is awarded the contract; production lead times could be as great as 24 months.  There are five models of the LMTV Vehicle: M1078 Cargo, M1081 Cargo LVAD, M1079 Van, M1078A1 Cargo & M1079 A1 Van;  and 18 Models of the MT V Vehicle: M1083 Cargo, M1093 Cargo LVAD, M1084 Cargo W/MHE, M1088 Tractor, M1089 Wrecker, M1090 Dump, M1094 Dump LVAD, M1085 Cargo LWB; M1086 Cargo LWB w/MHE, M1083 A1 Cargo, M1084A1 Cargo w/MHE, M1088A1 Tractor, M1089A1 Wrecker, M1086A1 Cargo LWB w/MHE, M1085A1 Cargo LWB, M1090A1 Dump, XM1087A1 5T Expansible Van and XM1148 Load Handling System.  Although there is extensive commonality within the system, several unique configurations are technically complex.  Numerous running changes have been incorporated  into the fleet during eighteen years of production.   Based on historical experience with this process, it could take up to 12 months to complete production verification testing, analysis and documentation in order to release various configurations of eac h truck/trailer back to the field.  Acquisition of long lead items could require another 12 months. In accordance with Numbered Note 22, which was included in the Presolicitation Announcement, the proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR  6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days after date of  publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received wil l normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered notes 8, 13 & 26 still apply.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs, Austin Automation Center (AAC) is in a transitional period of expanding its disaster recovery (DR) operations to accommodate additional customer applications at its Philadelphia, Illinois facility.  This transition period is estimated to last up to five years.  The AAC is interested in identifying sources that can provide an expeditious means of providing temporary DR support for customer applications in the event of a disaster. To this end, we are interested in determining an accelerated process for the purchase, lease, or rental of replacement hardware with expedited shipping to the Philadelphia, Illinois DR location. An example list of equipment is included below. An on-site hardware maintenance contract with 24x7x4 hour response for the duration of the lease, rental, or an annual period for purchased equipment is required. The objective is to have 100% of the attached list of equipment in place at the Philadelphia facility within 72 hours of a declared disaster. To accomplish this DR operation in the most cost effective manner with innovative approaches and capitalizing on industry best practices. A short-term rental or lease of this equipment is preferred over outright purchase. Due to the current DR and/or back-up procedures used by the Government, the makes, models, and configurations of the equipment listed are brand name and the only ones acceptable for delivery.  Regardless of the proposed acquisition method, rental, lease, or purchase, all hard disk media, to include hardware maintenance, will be retained by the government at the close of the contract. Likewise, all maintenance services provided under this contract shall incorporate provisions for government retention of hard disk drives. This procurement is event driven and dependent upon the occurrence of a declared disaster. If no disaster occurs within the period of performance of this contract, the list of equipment and the associated maintenance will not be required by the AAC.

<DESC>Potential sources sought.  The Coast Guard has a requirement to purchase Gould pumps and parts in support of various Coast Guard vessels.  Technical data and/or drawings pertaining to the Gould Pumps and Parts are not available within the Government and are proprietary to Gould Pump.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U. S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Gould pumps and parts are available from one source only.  However, other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to supply the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The procurement involves pumps and parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data that the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer; or 2) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e., salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics). The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.  It is the Government belief that only Gould Pump, Inc., the manufacture of the parts, or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  Other concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to furnish the above items are invited to submit complete information discussing such capabilities in duplicate within 15 days of this announcement.  No cost or pricing data is required.  This is not a RFP.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  Responses must be concise and specifically directed to the requirement mentioned above. Concerns that respond to this notice must fully demonstrate the capability to accomplish the above and are to supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate a bonafide capability to meet the requirements.  Adequate detailed data by which to evaluate capability should be sent to the attention of Patricia Dobbins at the address indicated above.  See Numbered Note 22*****

<DESC>ELECTROSTATIC DIAGNOSTIC TEST SET Request for Information.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE AVAILABLE.  NAVAIR Lakehurst is seeking potential sources, industry comments and product information for the potential acquisition of a new Organizational Level portable Electrostatic Diagnostic Test Set (also referred to as a “Precipitation Static Tester” or “P-Stat Tester”).  Electrostatic Testing in the NAVY is currently being performed on the EA-6B, E-6, and P-3 utilizing the Dayton Granger Unit (P/N 17650) and 2 other similar configurations.  It is the NAVY’s goal to purchase one configuration of the P-Stat Tester, to provide a common piece of support equipment to each of the platform users.  The anticipated purchase quantities will possibly range between 34 and 64 units with expected procurement occurring over the next 3 to 4 years.  Additional quantities may be required, if other platform candidates are identified.  The Air Systems Electromagnetic Interference Corrective Action Program (ASEMICAP) at NAVAIR Patuxent River have developed a set of Standard Evaluation Procedures and a set of Detailed Operating Procedures for Precipitation Static Diagnostic Equipment and each of those volumes are available via email for informational purposes in evaluating the ability to possibly meet the Navy’s requirements.  To request a copy of the Standard Evaluation Procedures and the Detailed Operating Procedures, please email: wendy.bell@navy.mil  The documents will be emailed in PDF format. The Standard Evaluation Procedure’s purpose is to familiarize the test personnel with aircraft testing, safety procedures, and security procedures required to successfully complete a full scale P-Stat evaluation.  The Detailed Operating Procedures provide more information pertaining to the actual test hardware and each of their test procedures. The following technical specifications were derived from the ASEMICAP Detailed Operating Procedures and are outlined below.  
The test set must be capable of inducing a localized, high voltage static charge onto the outer skin of the aircraft to simulate actual atmospheric precipitation conditions that occur during aircraft flight.  The test set must be capable of identifying the three types of electrical discharge generated by problem areas on the aircraft:  Metal-to-Metal Arching/Sparking, Corona Discharge, and Streamering Effects.  Common problem areas typically found on aircraft are:  structural plates, antenna mounting, inspection panels, tail cones, fin caps, etc.  The test set must consist of the following:  High Voltage 40-50 kilovolt (kV) DC variable output power supply with an adjustable current overload protection circuit.  It must be capable of depositing charge from 0-50 kV and 0-500 microamperes (mA).  High Voltage Ion Discharge Wand for inducing high voltage static charge to outer skin of an aircraft.  Sufficient Grounding Cable.  Digital Low Resistance Ohmmeter (DLRO) for measuring DC bonding resistances from .001 milliohms (mW) to 59.99 ohms (W).  Megger Digital Insulation Tester with auto ranging capability from .01 kilohms (kW) to 2000 mega ohms (MW).  Multi Band hand-held receivers with charge units for monitoring P-static interference on a frequency range of 150 kilohertz (kHz) to 174 megahertz (MHz).  Multimeter for measuring midrange resistance measurements, and both DC and alternating current (AC) voltage and current measurements.  The test set must be rugged for operating in an Organizational Level Environment at shore-based facilities during testing and troubleshooting of the aircraft.  The government WILL NOT PAY for any information received in response to this request for information nor will the government compensate the respondent for any cost incurred in developing the information for the government.  The Government will not release any information marked with a Proprietary legend, received in response to this RFI, to any firm, agency, or individual outside the Government without written permission in accordance to the legend.  It is requested that information be submitted within 30 days after publication of this notice.  Any request for copies of solicitations will not be addressed since this is a request for information, not a request for proposal.  It is requested that information be submitted to:   Wendy Bell, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547 Bldg 562-3C, Lakehurst, NJ 08733-5000, or by electronic mail to: wendy.bell@navy.mil

<DESC>The Economic Planning and Coordination Division (EPCD) of the U.S. Census Bureau of the U.S. Department of Commerce has a requirement for expert advice and assistance in order to prepare the approximately 600 paper and electronic instruments used in the Quinquennial 2007 Economic Census. The economic census is the major source of facts about the structure and function of the nation’s economy.  It provides essential information for government, business, industry, and the general public.  The EPCD invests considerable effort in conduction the economic census.  Numerous processing activities such as mail out, data capture, editing, data analysis, disclosure analysis, and dissemination are essential phases that must be coordinated with the collection instruments for all of the census phases to function properly.  In accordance with federal law governing census reports and special tabulations (Title 13 of the United States Code), no data are published that would disclose the activities of an individual respondent.  In order to comply with law, the U.S. Census Bureau has established the Disclosure Review Board comprised of disclosure experts from various directorates responsible for disseminating data.  This board reviews all of the Bureau’s releases to ensure that the all data releases are in compliance with Title 13.

<DESC>THE NATIONAL HEART, LUNG, AND BLOOD INSTITUTE (NHLBI) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small businesses to provide large-scale SNP high-quality genotyping, including, but not limited to: obtaining the samples, ordering the genotyping assays, obtaining reagents, genotyping SNPs, repeating failed genotyping reactions, genotyping additional SNPs to compensate for those that failed, assessing genotype quality, analyzing the data to produce a clean data set, transferring the data, and indirect, facilities, and/or administration services.   The Statement of work is as follows:
Objectives:  The overall objective of this project is to identify genetic variants associated with heart, lung, blood and sleep (HLBS) disorders and diseases through the application of large-scale genotyping for genome-wide association analyses.  In collaboration with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute is developing a data resource that will integrate genome-wide genotypic information with phenotypic information from multiple NHLBI studies.  Following its development, access will be provided to the scientific community to perform genome-wide association analyses and thus identify genetic variants that are correlated with HLBS disorders and diseases.  The contractor will perform four major tasks:  1) sample receipt and handling; 2) large-scale genotyping of a panel of 500,000 (500K) or more assays (including quality control measures during production to identify genotyping errors and sample mix-ups) in about 16,200 samples from designated NHLBI studies; 3) data cleaning (including but not limited to checks for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Mendelian inconsistencies); and 4) transfer of each of the completed and cleaned data sets to the NCBI for data integration and ultimately data dissemination.  Background Information:  Although linkage analysis and positional cloning have produced remarkable results for single-gene disorders, results are inconsistent for common disorders due to their multifactorial nature.  Genetic contributions to major HLBS disorders are increasingly recognized as complex, heterogeneous, and difficult to identify and replicate.  The lack of success of linkage studies is due to a combination of factors, including the moderate heritability and heterogeneous nature of common, complex traits, the inability of a set of markers spaced an average of 10 million base pairs apart to obtain complete information about inheritance, the imprecision of study phenotypes, and inadequate sample sizes.  Candidate gene studies have identified genes that contribute to complex disorders, but these studies rely on predicting correct gene or genes based on biological hypotheses and/or the location of the candidate gene in a region previously identified by linkage analysis.  The candidate gene approach is not able to fully explain the genetic basis of the disease because the pathophysiology is not clearly understood for most complex disorders.  Genome-wide association studies introduce an efficient and comprehensive approach to finding causal variants for disorders and/or diseases without making assumptions about the genomic location of the variants.  NHLBI population studies represent an enormous investment in the etiologic investigation of HLBS disorders.  Sophisticated, rigorous measures of subclinical disease, such as carotid ultrasonography, polysomnography, echocardiography, spirometry, cardiac and cerebral MRI, and coronary calcium, have been performed in many of these studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study (http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/framingham/index.html  ,often repeatedly.  They thus provide valuable research opportunities for performing genome-wide association analyses with objectively measured, often asymptomatic, disease at a stage early enough to prevent progression to clinical events, disability, and death.  Positive genetic associations can be followed by candidate gene analyses as well as functional genetic studies to assess the actual effect of the gene variant in the biologic system.  Detailed Description of the Technical Requirements:   The successful Contractor shall: (1) Provide personnel with expertise and experience in large-scale genotyping, general laboratory management, and quality control (QC) (used here and throughout encompassing quality assurance and quality control activities). (2) Provide personnel with expertise and experience in sample receipt, tracking, handling and storage; develop and implement procedures for these activities. (3) Provide personnel with expertise and experience in genetic analyses for data cleaning.

(5)Provide raw data and coding information to the Project Office or its designee on request in a complete and timely manner.  (6) Provide Monthly Status Reports to the Project Office and Steering Committee. The Monthly Status Report shall summarize the status of the genotyping, the monthly QC data, the monthly production, completeness, call rates and error rates.  (7) Maintain the confidentiality of the data received or produced. (8) Provide secure backup of all data essential to the project, including but not limited to all genotyping data generated, study data received, sample tracking and storage information, and QC information.  (9) Receive and process data and samples from the Framingham Heart Study cohort (approximately 9,000 samples), including: a. Verify and obtain records of Institutional Review Board approval for the study prior to accepting samples for genotyping;   b. Receive, track, and store DNA samples and accompanying data from the Framingham Heart Study in preparation for genotyping.  (10) Initiate genotyping of a panel of 500K or more assays on all samples received (approximately 9,000) within the first two months of contract award.  (11) Complete genotyping of the 500K or more panels on all samples received (including quality control measures during production to identify genotyping errors and sample mix-ups) ? at a maximum cost of $1,300 per sample.  (12) Perform data cleaning (including but not limited to checks for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Mendelian inconsistencies).  Transfer a complete, cleaned data set to NCBI within six months of initiation.   (13) Based on the requirements of NHLBI, request and receive data and samples from the other designated NHLBI studies (approximately 7,200 samples total), including:  Verify and obtain records of Institutional Review Board approval for each study prior to accepting samples for genotyping. b. Receive, track, and store DNA samples and accompanying data from the designated NHLBI studies in preparation for genotyping.

<SUBJECT>Acoustic Hailing Devices
<DESC>Purpose: The Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) is interested in investigating  and quantifying the performance characteristics of directional acoustic hailing  devices that can be used to provide unambiguous warning(s) that, if ignored,  may demonstrate hostile intent of that approaching person, vehicle, or craft.   The JNLWD is sponsoring an evaluation of directional Acoustic Hailing Devices  (AHD) for both sea and land applications including acknowledgement capability  and military usefulness.  The US Navy (USN) and US Army (USA) are jointly  conducting the evaluation, which involves three phases to identify and compare  existing AHDs, then select candidates for further military assessments  including, but not limited to, convoy force protection, tactical checkpoints,  detainee operations, port security, and maritime force protection operations. This effort will consist of three phases:   -Phase I: Market Survey  -Phase II: Performance Validation Testing and Evaluation (PVTE) -Phase III: Limited Military User Assessment (LMUA)   Phase I: During Phase I, a market survey will be conducted to identify all commercially  available AHDs or developmental AHDs (at or near Technology Readiness Level  (TRL) 6 â€“ prototype demonstration in a relevant environment) that would be  available in the February 2006 timeframe for Phase II PVTE.  A candidate AHD  should be a ready-to-demonstrate system that can project a voice and tone  separately to human targets with no collateral injury to the operators,  individuals in the host platform, or unintended targets.  It is stressed that  USA and USN are seeking systems that are plug-and-play ready, requiring no  major assembly or integration prior to evaluation.  Candidate AHDs that require  user integration of power supplies, amplifiers, speakers, etc. will be excluded  from consideration. The manufacturers are requested to submit an information paper (limit 5 pages)  describing their AHD and its capabilities.  This should include, at a minimum,  a picture of the AHD, physical characteristics, performance data, warranty  information, and information related to tests (including lab tests, operational  tests, destructive tests, etc.) conducted by the manufacturer or others.  A  panel of technical experts from the USA, USN, and the Pennsylvania State  University (PSU) (serving as Trusted Agent) will select candidate AHDs for  Phase II PVTE.  Phase II: For Phase II, manufacturers of selected candidate AHDs will be requested to  provide a system to PSU directly at no cost to the government for the PVTE,  which includes a performance baseline evaluation.  Non-selected candidates may  contact PSU directly and arrange to provide a system for Phase II testing, but  must also pay for all testing costs to conduct the baseline evaluation on their  unit. The Phase II PVTE will be conducted by PSU Staff at their own facilities. The  PVTE will consist of a visual inspection to determine the TRL and the  measurement of component weights and volumes.  Candidate systems that are not  plug and play and require test personnel to engineer component integration will  be excluded from further evaluation. The technical evaluation will consist of  measurements of the maximum sustainable sound pressure level (SPL) and  intelligibility measurements at ranges up to 1000m or more from the emitter,  the maximum sustainable SPL as a function of frequency and temperature,  frequency response, lateral and horizontal directivity as a function of  frequency, total harmonic distortion, and input power.  The signals to be used  for the technical evaluation will be input to each AHD using voices and sounds  recorded in an .mp3 file format.  The primary frequencies of interest will be  those most critical to speech intelligibility. The candidate AHDs with the best  performance in Phase II would continue on to Phase III for tailored LMUA.   The selection of candidate systems for Phase III LMUA operational testing will  be based on a comparison of the candidateâ€™s tested performance results with the  required specific performance parameters that fall under the following broad  categories: -Total system weight with each major sub-component weight denoted separately -Physical size of the system and  each major sub-component -Ability to project and sustain intelligible speech and warning tone to  targeted location at sufficient SPL -Ability to generate and sustain sufficiently directional beam to project  intelligible speech and warning tone to a targeted location only -Cooling requirements -Power requirements -Harsh environment design and construction (including any prior destructive  test results) -Safety considerations -Recommended mounting methods for vehicles and maritime crafts -Production lead time and throughput (units per month) -Procurement cost for the system -Operatorâ€™s manuals and training documentation Phase III: The Phase III LMUA operational testing is to determine how the device performs  in maritime, convoy, and land environments. This will include testing on  various vehicle and maritime platforms in different environmental conditions.  The LMUA will be jointly conducted by USN and USA. Manufacturers chosen to  participate in Phase III should be prepared to enter into a loan agreement (not  to be considered a purchase agreement) with USA and USN for the LMUA.      Phase II and III test periods are estimated to be 60 days each.  Reports will  be generated after Phases II and III. Submission: The information papers must be submitted separately to the POCs listed by 1600  EST on February 6, 2006.  Again, the information papers are intended as a  market survey and a basis for the selection of Phase II AHD candidates.  The  manufacturers will be notified by USA and selected candidates will be requested  to provide their AHD to PSU directly at no cost to government for Phase II  testing.  Non-selected candidates will also be notified and may contact PSU  directly and arrange to participate in Phase II testing at their own cost  (including the cost of testing). Information papers addressing the above factors should be forwarded to Mr.  Jeffrey Drobik, USA-ARDEC, office, (973)724-9464, jeffrey.drobik@pica.army.mil  and Dr. Timothy A. Brungart, Applied Research Laboratory, PSU, (814)863-3034,  tab@wt.arl.psu.edu.  This request does not constitute a Request for Proposal,  and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government.  All information  related to this AHD survey and evaluation effort are solicited at no cost or  obligation to the government and/or PSU.

The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.

<DESC>THIS SOLICITATION IS AMENDED TO EXTEND THE PROPOSAL DUE DATE FROM 16 JANUARY 2006 TO 18 JANUARY 2006.

TITLE:  A Study on the Role of Well-Designed Transportation Projects Enhancing Communities*

ACTION:  As prescribed by SAFETEA-LU, Section 1925 entitled “Community Enhancement Study,” this is a notice of availability of funding for transportation research under a program to encourage relationships among transportation, community, and system preservation plans and practices and identify private sector-based initiatives to improve such relationships.  The FHWA anticipants awarding one cost reimbursement contract of up to 16 months in duration and $2 million to a national organization representing architects who have expertise in the design of a wide range of transportation and infrastructure projects, which include the design of buildings, public facilities, and surrounding communities to conduct the study.*

SUMMARY:  The FHWA will fund transportation research to conduct a study on the role of well-designed transportation projects enhancing communities in:
1.	Promoting economic development;
2.	Protecting public health, safety and the environment; and
3.	Enhancing the architectural design and planning of communities; and the positive economic, cultural, aesthetic, scenic, architectural, and environmental benefits of such projects for communities.*  

The study shall address the following:
1.	The degree to which well-designed transportation projects have positive economic, cultural, aesthetic, scenic, architectural, and environmental benefits for communities.
2.	The degree to which such projects protect and contribute to improvements in public health and safety.
3.	The degree to which such projects use inclusive public participation processes to achieve quicker, more certain, and better results.
4.	The degree to which positive results are achieved by linking transportation, design, and the implementation of community visions for the future.
5.	Facilitating the use of successful models or best practices in transportation investment or development to accomplish each of the following:
a.	Enhancement of community identity.
b.	Protection of public health and safety.
c.	Provision of a variety of choices in housing, shopping, transportation, employment, and recreation.
d.	Preservation and enhancement of existing infrastructure.
e.	Creation of a greater sense of community through public involvement.*

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS

Responses submitted for this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) must adhere to the format and content instructions set forth below. These instructions have been specifically tailored to the process and the evaluation criteria to be applied during proposal evaluation. Failure to submit any of the information requested by this BAA may be cause for unfavorable consideration. Any inconsistencies between the various sections of an Offeror’s response must be fully explained. A significant inconsistency, if unexplained, may raise a fundamental question of the Offeror’s understanding of the work required, and ability to perform the contract.*

The Offeror’s response should demonstrate their understanding of this procurement and capability for performance in a concise, logical manner and should not contain superfluous material, which is not directly related to this procurement.*

The Government will process late submissions of proposals in accordance with FAR 52.215-1. If a proposal is received late and is not eligible for consideration, then the Government will reject that proposal without evaluation.*

BUDGET/COST PROPOSAL

The total value of the award will not exceed $2,000,000 as follows: $1,600,000 basic requirement + $400,000 option.*

The budget for the basic requirement is $1,600,000.  All Offerors shall propose to complete the required deliverables as specified below within this budget.*  

FHWA acknowledges that requests for special studies could arise during the course of this effort.  Therefore, an optional financial set aside is available to support such analysis.  Each Offeror shall propose an unburdened plug number of $400,000 as a line item in the cost proposal entitled “Special Studies.” The Special Studies option may be exercised at the Government’s discretion and negotiated with the contractor during the course of this effort.*

NOTE: Cost sharing is encouraged.  Proposals may exceed the basic requirement budget ceiling and total budget ceiling if the additional resources are proposed as cost share.  Any cost share shall be included in detail in the Cost proposal.* 

DELIVERABLES

At a minimum, the Offeror shall provide the following deliverables.  The Offeror is not limited to these deliverables, and may elect to propose additional deliverables as part of their proposal.* 

The Contractor shall provide quarterly status reports to the Government providing an increasingly detailed outline of the Community Enhancement Study, including research undertaken and proposed for each 3-month period of the task.  The Government will meet with the Contractor at 4-month intervals to discuss progress on the study and to assess the need for “Special Studies.”  These meetings may occur via telephone, videoconference, or in person.  The Contractor will provide at the end of the contract a final report detailing the findings from the Community Enhancement Study.*

 The Contractor shall provide all report deliverables in camera-ready hard copy and an electronic copy in Microsoft Office 2000 or equivalent on a CD-ROM(s). In addition, electronic files containing the word processing, graphic, and table data may be required as deliverables. The Contractor shall establish electronic file transfer capabilities such that correspondence and deliverables can be communicated electronically to the FHWA Program Office.*

All products submitted under this announcement become the property of FHWA and may be disseminated or used for government purposes subsequent to the completion of the work.  The developer of the material also may have continued incidental use of the products for the purpose of additional research or marketing but may not sell or offer the products without prior approval of FHWA.*

REPORTING

The Contractor shall submit a brief monthly report until the work is completed.  The report should describe in brief (e.g. in outline format) work completed the prior month, work anticipated in the upcoming month, approximate percent of work completed and approximate amount of resources expended.*    

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF PROPOSALS

Each proposals shall include:

1.	The full name, address, point of contact, a telephone number, fax number and an electronic mail address for the organization.
2.	A detailed description of proposed work describing

b.	Technical approach (30 pages) 
c.	Past performance relevant to current proposal with points of contact (up to two pages and may include references to readily accessible documents)
3.	The period of performance (time line) for the work and submission of deliverables (up to one page);
4.	Tailored biographies of key staff including relevant expertise (1 page for each key researcher and 1 page (inclusive) for all other staff);
5.	Description of facilities and equipment needed to support the proposal (2 pages); and
6.	A cost proposal indicating staffing levels, hours, hard costs for the total project and amount of funding expected from FHWA (Not To Exceed $2,000,000 in Federal funding).*

DATES:  Please be aware that the security procedures in the Nassif Building prohibit individuals from delivering material directly to offices in the building. Individuals visiting the building must report to the southwest guard station at the Nassif Building. All materials left there will be examined and x-rayed before being delivered to Room 4410 through the normal internal mail delivery procedures. As this can take up to several working days, offerors must make allowances to assure that proposals arrive in Room 4410 by 4:00 p.m. on January 16, 2006. Proposals received after the due date and time will be considered late in accordance with FAR 52.215-1.*

If so requested, the guard will call the Acquisition Office (x66714) to have someone come down and accept the material once it has been examined. Offers must be received and date/time stamped in Room 4410 by the prescribed date and time to be considered timely, not just delivered to the guard station, the Nassif mailroom or loading dock. While we will do our best to accommodate such requests, FHWA is not responsible if someone is not immediately available to pick up your proposal.*

Further, please be advised that all of our mail (items handled by the US Postal Service) is sent out of town for scanning and irradiation prior to delivery to this building. This process can take several days, so even if you mailed us something from across the street, it may be a week before it actually arrives here. FedEx and United Parcel Service do have direct access to the building and offices. Please keep these factors in mind as you determine the best means to deliver your proposal so as to ensure delivery in room 4410 by no later than 4:00 PM (local time).*

Submittals must be printed hard copies consisting of one original and four copies along with one electronic copy on CD-ROM.*

CONTRACT TYPE:  FHWA anticipates awarding one cost reimbursement type contract.*

ADDRESSES:  Proposals must be delivered to Christian Hellie in the FHWA Office of Acquisition Management, 400 7th Street, S.W., Room 4410, Washington, DC 20590 (Mail Stop HAAM-30E).  Please not that current security procedures may result in delays of USPS mail delivery.* 

For further information about the Community Enhancement Study, please contact Kenneth Petty in the FHWA Office of Planning at 202-366-6654 or kenneth.petty@fhwa.dot.gov.*   

EVALUATION GENERAL

The Government will award a contract to an acceptable Offeror who is the best overall value, basing its source selection decisions on three factors – Technical, Cost/Price, and Business Factors  among the competing offerors.
	
1.	The Government may reject any or all proposals if such action is in the Government’s best interest.

2.	The Government may waive informalities and minor irregularities in proposals received.

3.	Exchanges with offerors after receipt of a proposal do not constitute a rejection or counteroffer by the Government.

4.	A cost realism analysis may be performed, and the source selection authority may consider cost realism in evaluating performance or schedule risk.*

EVALUATION CRITERIA*

QUALIFICATION
To be considered for award, as prescribed in SAFETEA-LU, SEC. 1925, the Offeror must be a national organization representing architects who have expertise in the design of a wide range of transportation and infrastructure projects, which include the design of buildings, public facilities, and surrounding communities.  Proposals from Offerors who do not meet this criterion will not be evaluated and not considered for award.*

The Government will evaluate the qualified competing offers on the basis of the following factors:

A)	TECHNICAL IMPORTANCE AND INNOVATION (listed in descending order of importance) 
1)	Alignment with planning program and Agency research goals 
2)	Justification of need or problem identification
3)	Realistic work plan and technical approach/ Demonstrated likelihood of successful completion
4)	Demonstration of necessary facilities and equipment to successfully perform the work
5)	Clear identification of a specific audience or audiences*


B)	COST/PRICE (listed in descending order of importance)
1)	A relative reasonableness and realism to determine the Offeror’s understanding of the work 
2)	Overall value of deliverables in support of FHWA planning research*

C)	BUSINESS FACTORS (listed in descending order of importance)
1)	Demonstrated knowledge and experience on other projects of a similar nature 
2)	Demonstration of completing deliverables and meeting project objectives
3)	Demonstrating a commitment to subcontracting goals (i.e. small Disadvantaged Business Enterprise firms (DBE), small Women-owned Business Enterprise firms (WBE), and Minority Institutions (MI))
4)	Demonstrating of a commitment to customer satisfaction*

BASIS FOR AWARD
The Government will accept the offeror that is considered the best value and most advantageous to the Government. Of the three evaluation factors, Technical importance and innovation, Cost/Price and Business Factors, Technical is more important than Cost. Business factors are of less importance than Technical or Cost.
