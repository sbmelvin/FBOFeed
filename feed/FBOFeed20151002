<DESC>This announcement serves two purposes:  1) This is a Notice of Contracting Action for an anticipated upcoming program and BAA announcement as summarized below; and 2) this is also a Sources Sought Notice for the purpose of conducting market research to identify potential sources that possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience to meet Air Force needs as identified below:
<p>The objective of this program will be to design, develop and demonstrate a relevant-scale tactical vehicle thermal management system which optimally manages transport of heat from dynamical heat loads to the available aircraft sinks of fuel and/or engine air during the course of pertinent mission sets.  The solicitation seeks integrated system-level solutions.  As such, component-specific solutions are not within the scope of this activity.  Further, technological risks necessary to achieve a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 demonstration must be identified and a suitable risk-mitigation plan provided which may include integrated testing with an adaptive-cycle turbine engine.  Longer term objectives may include integrated testing of the TRL 6 integrated system technology with an adaptive-cycle or surrogate engine to mitigate risks prior to vehicle EMD.</p>

<DESC>The objective of this solicitation is to evaluate, design, and develop key technologies and integrated systems for meeting the auxiliary power and thermal system requirements of next generation aircraft. Specifically, aircraft-level accessory system architecture analysis, system and component design and development, and integrated system demonstrations will likely be required under this activity. The solicitation seeks full thermal and auxiliary power system-level solutions. As such, component-specific solutions alone do not fulfill the scope of this activity. Successful offerors need to have the capability to design, model, build and test up to full-scale PTMS units and integrated subsystems. An outcome of this activity will include identifying technology risks to achieving up to TRL 6 demonstrations with complementary risk mitigation plans. During the course of this activity, ground tests which seek to address each of these risks will likely be required wherein key vehicle functions may be simulated or emulated through practical means. While on-engine testing, either through directtest with an adaptive-cycle turbine engine or surrogate, may be cost prohibitive, risks associated with dynamical engine responses may need to be identified and explored as practical through system emulation and/or modeling. In addition, an on-engine test plan, with associated risks delineated, may be requested.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) John F. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) plans to issue a revision to the CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services Request for Proposal (RFP) on or around October 31, 2015, and encourages new and existing providers to submit proposals. The CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services RFP was issued on December 5, 2013, and remains open for a period of five years from the effective date through the use of an innovative on-ramp provision found in Section I, Clause I.6. To date, the RFP has resulted in the award of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contracts to 406 Aerospace LLC, A-Tech Corporation, Spaceflight, Inc., TriSept Corporation, and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, Inc. Each October during the life of the contract, or at any other time established via synopsis, the Government will request proposals from new CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Service providers for IDIQ contracts and proposals from existing IDIQ contractors for additional CubeSat Dispenser Hardware and Integration Services. <p> A CubeSat is a type of miniaturized space research satellite that typically uses commercial, off-the-shelf electronic components. In support of this effort, offerors must be capable of performing the standard service, which includes engineering development support, dispenser carrier hardware, CubeSat to dispenser and dispenser to launch vehicle (LV) integration, and system testing. Additionally, offerors may be required to perform non-standard services (such as de-integration and commercial flight services), mission unique services, and special task assignments related to the hardware and integration services. Offerors need not be capable of performing commercial flight services to be eligible for an IDIQ contract award under this acquisition. <p> The contract ordering period is effective from date of contract award through July 7, 2019. The minimum order value is $10,000 with a maximum order value of $9,500,000. <p> This requirement is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. <p> This procurement will be conducted under FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in conjunction with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation. <p> It is requested that all interested parties notify NASA, in writing, no later than October 15, 2015, of your intent to submit a proposal during this on-ramp period, as well as the CubeSat dispensers you intend to propose. If no responses are received, or if only negative responses are received, the on-ramp effort for 2015 will be cancelled and the next on-ramp effort will begin in October 2016. It is anticipated that proposals will be due on or around December 1, 2015. The firm date for the receipt of proposals will be stated in the RFP. All responsible sources may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation, which will be considered by NASA. <p> The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet on the Government-wide point of entry (GPE). The GPE can be accessed via the Internet at <A HREF="http://fedbizopps.gov">http://fedbizopps.gov </A>  . It is the offerors responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any). An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Naval Air Warfare Center - Aircraft Division, Lakehurst, NJ, under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1, intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract, on a sole-source basis, to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), Indianapolis, IN for the production of Lot One of the Common Aircraft Armament Test Set (CAATS) and the Pure Air Generator (PAG) Adapter Set (PAS) to test and troubleshoot bomb racks, missile launchers, pylons and emerging weapons carriage devices across most aircraft weapons systems. The PAS interfaces with the CAATS to test the LAU-7 and LAU-127 Hi-Pressure Pure Air Generator (HiPPAG) Launchers. The CAATS, which includes the PAS, will replace the legacy A/E37T-35A Common Rack and Launcher Test Set (CRALTS) which has reliability and obsolescence issues as well as design limitations that impact its ability to support future weapons carriage requirements.<br /><br />SAIC will sustain all drawings, configuration management, logistics, release and control requirements, design, manufacturing, testing, and calibration throughout the first lot of production of the CAATS and PAS. As the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), SAIC possesses the required expertise to finalize the production drawing package to facilitate a competitive procurement for the follow-on production requirements. Concurrently producing the first lot, while accomplishing the physical configuration audit and drawing package completion, will allow the program to meet the fleet's fielding requirements for the CAATS and PAS test gear.<br /><br />The Government does not possess the rights to the drawings for the CAATS and PAS. SAIC is the OEM of the CAATS, and PAS,&nbsp;and has proprietary ownership of the drawings, therefore SAIC is the only firm with the knowledge of the technical requirements to manufacture the CAATS/PAS without a disruption in schedule or additional cost to the program.<br /><br />Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider all responses received to this notice.&nbsp; A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.&nbsp; Information received as a result of the notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.&nbsp; No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice <br>  <br> This project will be announced as W912DR-15-B-0006. <br>  <br> Project Description: Maintenance Dredging, Twitch Cove and Big Thorofare, Somerset County, Smith Island, Maryland  <br>  <br> 1. The proposed procurement is 100% Small Business (SB) set-aside, North Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 237990 (Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction) with a magnitude of construction between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000. <br>  <br> 2. Project Description: The maintenance dredging of Twitch Cove and Big Thorofare on Smith Island must be performed using a hydraulic pipeline dredge.  The proposed work consists of dredging the entire channel length of Twitch Cove and 2 sections of the Big Thorofare channel, totaling approximately 2.7 miles.  The channels will be dredged to the authorized depth of 7 feet mean lower low water (MLLW), plus 1 to 2 feet of allowable over-depth (depending on the channel reach).  The material will be placed at Swan Island, located in the Martin National Wildlife Refuge, to restore dune and wetland habitat.  The material shall be contained with coir logs and both the dune and wetland areas will be planted.  Additionally, a 100 ft long shoreline protection feature, consisting of interlocking concrete armor units, will be constructed on the northeast side of Swan Island to protect the restored dune and wetlands from wind and waves.  Approximately 77,000 cubic yards of material consisting primarily of sand, silt, mud, shell and combinations thereof, are to be dredged.  The maximum pumping distance is approximately 7 miles.  Booster pumps may be needed to transport some of the material to farther distances.  Low pressure equipment will be required to shape the material into the specified cross sections at specified elevations. <br>  <br> 3. The solicitation will be provided in an electronic format, free of charge on or about 05 November 2015, to all authenticated account holders registered with the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System.

<p>1.1 Base Bid Item(s)</p>
<p>1.1.1 Base Bid Item 1 - Removal and Installation of Paging System<br />Remove the existing paging system and install a new telephone paging system inside various facilities at the Mount Morris Dam project site.</p>

<p>5 Detailed Description of Work</p>
<p>5.1 Detailed Description of Work - Base Bid Item(s)</p>
<p>5.1.1 Base Bid Item 1 - Removal and Installation of Paging System<br />The contractor shall remove all traces of the existing paging system and install a new complete one-way telephone paging system throughout three buildings at the Mount Morris Dam reservation; the dam itself, the maintenance garage, and the pole barn. Refer to Attachment #1 for an elevation view of the dam and Attachment #2 for an aerial view of the maintenance garage and pole barn.</p>
<p>The existing paging system operates on a 9-zone Valcom paging controller connected to a Nortel Meridian Private Automatic Branch Exchange (PABX) located within Level 6 of the dam. All equipment and hardware existing inside the dam and maintenance garage shall be removed, including but not limited to speakers/horns, copper cabling, zone controllers, and power supplies. There is one speaker located on the outside of the maintenance garage near the PBX and all remaining hardware is within the dam itself. Refer to Attachment #3 for the location of all speakers within the dam, which are wired back to the zone controller on Level 6. Several speakers have wires within conduit which shall be removed. All cabling between equipment shall be removed. New cabling runs shall be installed under this contract.</p>
<p>After all components of the existing system are removed, the contractor shall install a new telephone paging system which shall be designed by either the paging system manufacturer or an electrical engineer. Include a resume of the designer as part of a pre-work submittal if not designed by the manufacturer. There are no restrictions on equipment manufacturers. The system shall be a complete functioning one-way paging system consisting of telephone access modules, amplifiers, and horn speakers. Zone controllers shall not be used as the system is two separate single zones. The system shall be a constant voltage system. The 70V speakers shall be powered by an independent amplifier as the telephone access module will be replaced in the near future for an IP zone interface. The contractor shall submit a final design submittal detailing cable runs with connected speakers. The contractor shall refrain from ordering materials and equipment prior to approval by the government.</p>
<p>A total of twenty (20) speakers shall be installed under this contract. Speakers shall be of the horn type, rated to an output power of 15 W, and shall operate at 70V due to long cable runs. Speakers shall have individual taps to control power output. All speakers shall be rated for outdoor use and shall be of aluminum or plastic construction. Painted steel speakers are not acceptable due to the corrosive environment inside the dam. Speakers shall be mounted in a manner that allows them to be aimed down long corridors. All mounting hardware shall be stainless steel.</p>
<p>Two (2) telephone access modules shall be installed, each feeding a single amplifier. System #1 shall have a total of sixteen (16) speakers on one zone within the dam, and installed adjacent to the PBX on Level 6 of the dam. System #2 shall have one zone with a total of four (4) speakers within two buildings, the maintenance garage and the pole barn, and shall be located in the office area within the maintenance garage. This controller shall be mounted adjacent to the PBX in the office inside the maintenance garage.</p>
<p>Each controller shall have its own amplifier from which the contractor shall run cables to all speaker locations. Speaker cables shall be rated to wire gauge based upon voltage drop, wire loss, power draw per wire run, etc. A maximum quantity of six speakers may be on the same wiring run given the cable is sized appropriately and the amplifier channel can support the load. All cables shall be outdoor/wet rated and shielded. Multiple conductor cable may be used. The speaker locations for all buildings are detailed in the table below. The speakers are also shown in an elevation drawing of the dam in Attachment #1 and on an aerial photo of the speakers for the maintenance garage and the pole barn in Attachment #2. As the maximum wire run distances are approximately 900 feet, the contractor shall field verify all wire lengths prior to designing the system and order materials and equipment.</p>
<p>The amplifiers for Systems #1 and #2 shall be sized no lower than a total output power of 600 W and 120 W, respectively. All wiring shall be installed in existing cable trays where accessible, otherwise the contractor may zip tie cabling to existing conduit or use low voltage cable fasteners. Any fasteners shall be stainless steel or another approved corrosion resistant material. The government shall approve all wiring runs prior to mounting cable. For installation of the speakers in the pole barn, there is an existing sub-grade communications conduit from the maintenance garage to the pole barn which shall be used.</p>
<p>The government will determine exact mounting locations of speakers at the time of installation. The contractor shall not install any equipment until the location is approved by the government.</p>
<p>Both telephone access modules shall be hooked up to a module within the PBX. The PBX is a Nortel Meridian installed in 1998. The telephone access module shall be programmed to extensions on the PBX chosen by the government. The contract will be considered complete when the contractor demonstrates full functionality of the system, including all requirements within this Statement of Work, and all speakers/horns operating loudly and clearly from any telephone. Any speakers not operating at optimum volume and clarity due to insufficient wiring runs, or speakers experiencing hum-type inference, shall be rewired before the final payment is made to the contractor.</p>

A Single Award Task Order Contract (SATOC) is anticipated to be awarded at each of the 8 facilities.  Work under each SATOC will primarily involve repairs, renovations, and minor alterations to existing facilities and/or infrastructure such as roads, parking, drainage systems, and utility systems in accordance with the scope of work and applicable specifications at the time of task order issuance.  The majority of the task orders awarded under each SATOC will be between $25,000 and $75,000 with a task order ceiling of approximately $150,000. Although, Contractors should have bonding capabilities in the range of $500,000.

One SATOC will be awarded for each of the 8 facilities listed, above.  A Contractor will only be awarded 1 of the 8 intended SATOCs.  Contractors should prioritize the top 3 preferred facilities. Contractors should have a staffed office within the surrounding local commuting area, as routine travel costs will not be accepted at the task order level.   

In accordance with 5 CFR 351.203 Local commuting area is defined as the geographic area that usually constitutes one area for employment purposes. It includes any population center (or two or more neighboring ones) and the surrounding localities in which people live and can reasonably be expected to travel back and forth daily to their usual employment.

It is anticipated that the contract performance period will include 1, one-year basic period, and 4, one-year option periods for a maximum contract life of 5 years should all options be exercised.

This announcement is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for competitive bids/proposals. This announcement is not to be construed as a commitment by the Department of Veterans Affairs.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.

<DESC>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.   This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential repair sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside.  This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research.  No funds are available to fund the information solicited. 

The 424TH Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the repair/overhaul/re-manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below.  The Government will use this information to determine the best future acquisition strategy for this procurement, inclusive of the need to do an Industry Day and/or Presolicitation Conference.  The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. Qualification requirements are defined in the OC-ALC Source Approval Information Booklet.  Consequently, potential sources for this effort typically would be companies who have a license or agreement with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) Sora Power Inc., Cage 13058 to complete the work described, including military specific modifications. 
The proposed North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code is 334511, which has a corresponding Size Standard of 750 employees.  The Government is interested in all businesses to include, Large Business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Businesses 8(a)s, Service-Disabled  Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Hubzone Businesses, and Women-Owned Small Businesses. The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code.  Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.  Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime, and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.

The contractor shall be capable of furnishing all required labor, material, facilities and equipment to accomplish repair/overhaul/re-manufacture, test, preservation and packaging, and return to the government a completely serviceable unit.  Contractor will be responsible for supply chain management, logistics, forecasting of parts, long-lead parts procurement, reparable forecasting, obsolescence issues and delivery of serviceable assets.  The government requests that interested parties respond to this notice in writing including details of your ability to either provide a copy of the OEMs repair manual (including disassembly, repair, test and an illustrated parts breakdown including part numbers) or an OEM licensee agreement certifying your business is approved by the OEM to repair this equipment.
The specific requirement for this effort is found the table below.  The item is a Delay Reactor and Switching Transformer. The delay reactor and switching transformers T4 are saturable inductors. The initial state of both inductor cores is saturated, but in the opposite direction to the discharge current path. The saturated state and direction is set by the reset current flow from the 6.25A reset bias supply through the reset windings. When transmit SCR Q1 fires, the delay reactor and switching transformers arc connected across the charged capacitor bank. The nominal 1 kv charge of the capacitor bank begins to cause a small current flow through the high-impedance windings of the delay reactor and switching transformer primary. Since the core saturated field is in the reverse direction of discharge current flow, the reactor windings are a high impedance when Q1 is fired. After approximately 10 &#956;s, the delay reactor slowly comes out of saturation. The switching transformer primary is reduced to the inductive state, and the delay reactor quickly traverses through its inductive state and saturates in the direction of discharge current flow. The delay reactor delay time is necessary to slowly turn on Q1. An SCR requires a small current flowing through it before heavy conduction to prevent overheating and burnout. Requirements for testing facilities can be found in Source Control Document 230030.  No tech data beyond drawing 230030 can be made available by the government.  

Part Number               	NSN           	Noun         Estimated Repair Qty         
230030-1	 5950-01-275-0862IM	 Transformer Reactor            Basic Year = 5
Option Year One = 5, Option Year Two = 5, Option Year Three = 5, Option Year Four = 5

<DESC>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center (ARC) is hereby soliciting information under this Request for Information (RFI) to determine whether or not there are interested and available vendor sources capable of meeting the identified requirements. <P> Statement of Work: <P> 1. OBJECTIVE: A Langmuir-Blodgett deposition trough is required for the fabrication of biomembranes. Langmuir-Blodgett film contains one or more monolayers of an organic material, deposited from the surface of a liquid onto a solid by immersing (or emersing) the solid substrate into (or from) the liquid. A monolayer is adsorbed homogeneously with each immersion or emersion step, thus films with very accurate thickness can be formed. This thickness is accurate because the thickness of each monolayer is known and can therefore be added to find the total thickness of a LangmuirBlodgett film. The monolayers are assembled vertically and are usually composed of amphiphilic molecules with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail (example: fatty acids). <P> 2. SPECIFICATIONS: <P> Interface unit for automatic control of mono/bi-layer film depositions; Barrier drive with symmetric compression, with max compression ratio >10; Surface area of trough top > 250 cm2; Pair of hydrophilic Delrin barriers with adjustable speed in the range 0.1  250 mm/min; Dipper for fully automatic and software controlled operation for LB-film depositions on solid substrates, with adjustable dipping speed in the range 0.1  100 mm/min; Software for Windows 7 & 8 operating systems; and Instruction manual. <P> The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ARC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties, including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SDVOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small business subcontracting goals for the Linear Actuation System. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. <P> Interested firms are requested to submit their response to this RFI via email only to Karen Klaas at email karen.klaas@nasa.gov no later than 4:00 p.m. PST, on Tuesday 10/13/2015. Submissions shall be compatible with and accessible using Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat software applications. When responding, reference RFI NNA16564683L-AKK - Langmuir-Blodgett Deposition Trough. <P> This announcement does not constitute a Request for Proposal.  Please do not request for a copy of the solicitation, as no solicitation exists at this time. If a firm requirement is developed and a solicitation is issued, the solicitation will be made available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (www.fbo.gov) and the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) (<A HREF="http://procure.arc.nasa.gov">http://procure.arc.nasa.gov </A> ). It is the responsibility of offerors and interested parties to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments, if any and will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the documents. NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to identify potential sources that can provide the necessary post-production software support (PPSS) for the Army's Standard Army Maintenance System - Enhanced (SAMS-E) to satisfy combatant logistics automation requirements and sustainment needs in support of the Product Director, Logistics Information Systems (PD LIS), Fort Lee, Virginia. The scope of this requirement is to provide support services to PD LIS in the areas of PPSS, software testing, configuration management, Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM), help desk and customer assistance support, and program management support for SAMS-E. Do not submit a proposal or quote. After reviewing the description of requirements, interested and capable contractors are invited to provide responses to the following requested information. Responses should follow this format and be submitted electronically as one complete document. This RFI is for informational purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to procure any items/services, or for the Government to pay for the information received. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI or any follow-up information request.</p>
<p>This announcement is in support of market research performed by the Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) to determine interest and capability to perform all services delineated below.</p>
<p>Background: PD LIS supports the Active Army, Army National Guard, and Army Reserves from the unit to battalion level, and other agencies within the Department of Defense. PD LIS is responsible for ensuring PPSS is performed on the SAMS-E software baseline. The system is operated by both Field and Sustainment level ground maintenance and Logistics Readiness Center (LRC) installation maintenance personnel worldwide; providing life cycle software solutions and services that enable warfighting superiority and information dominance across the Enterprise.</p>
<p>SAMS-E is the Army's tactical Logistics Information System of record for ground maintenance. It is found at Field and Sustainment level organizations and assists users in managing unit level maintenance management, supply, and readiness reporting functions. It allows The Army Maintenance Management System Department of the Army Pamphlet (PAM) 750-8 functional requirements to be utilized in an automated environment and provides tracking of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance events, work-order management and supply transactions for issue, receipt, and turn-in of class IX items. SAMS-E interfaces with information trading partners via Secure File Transfer Protocol on Very Small Aperature Terminal and Non-Secure Internet Protocol Router networks.</p>
<p>The SAMS-E application was developed using the C# (Sharp) programming language. The SAMS-E application interacts with an Oracle 11g R2 database to store and access data. These two items, the SAMS-E application and Oracle database, are combined with the current Army Golden Master (AGM) operating system to produce the SAMS-E baseline.</p>
<p>There are three configurations of SAMS-E: SAMS-1E, SAMS-2E and SAMS-IE. SAMS-1E is used by tactical units at the motor pool level to manage maintenance and requisition parts on a daily basis. SAMS-2E is used at the Brigade level by maintenance managers who analyze and report readiness. SAMS-IE is used by LRCs at the installation level. The current hardware platform used by SAMS-1E, SAMS-2E, and SAMS-IE clients is the Dell 6520 laptop. The SAMS-IE server, needed to manage up to 200 clients at an LRC, is the Dell 2900 PowerEdge. The SAMS-E printer is the Lexmark 462dtn. The current operating system for SAMS-1E/2E is Windows 7 and the SAMS-IE is Windows Server 2008. Historically, the SAMS-E baseline has been distributed to the field as an image using the Windows Imaging Format. SAMS-E systems by design are standalone tactical systems with each containing its own Oracle database. It is not a web based enterprise system at this time.</p>
<p>Services include dedicated, on-site support in the following areas:</p>
<p>&bull; System and Software Sustainment Support<br />&bull; Post Production Software Support (PPSS)<br />&bull; Software Testing Support<br />&bull; Configuration Management Support<br />&bull; Security and Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) Support<br />&bull; Help Desk and Customer Assistance Support<br />&bull; System Enhancement and Technology Insertion Support<br />&bull; Program Management Support</p>

<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters, regulates, and supervises all United States national banks and federal savings associations (thrifts). OCC also supervises the federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. Headquartered in Washington, DC, the OCC has four district offices plus an office in London to supervise the international activities of national banks. Bank supervision is the core activity of the agency.
<p>In support of its mission to ensure a safe, sound, and competitive banking system, the OCC employs a range of sophisticated applications, business systems, and databases. Deployed assets range from point-solution applications to enterprise services, including web content management, document management, records management, knowledge management, identity management, notification services, data management and analytics, and enterprise-wide security operations. To enable its business units to easily and independently access and use these information assets, the OCC provides a secure, high-availability data delivery platform that offers the technical infrastructure and services required to process, share, and secure the large volume of highly-sensitive data used by the OCC workforce. Information Technology Infrastructure Support Services (ITISS) provides contracted IT support services with a customer-focused service delivery model based upon ITSM principles. A range of engineering, operations, and technical support services are provided via an efficient, performance-based contract that leverages an optimized Contractor skill mix for core services, augmented by a proven, agile, just-in-time approach to the provision of surge support and subject matter expert (SME) capabilities.

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Purpose: The National Guard Bureau, Contracting Support Office intends on issuing a contract which will provide for US States and Territories for the <strong><em>Army National Guard Recruiting and Retention Commands (RRCs)</em></strong>, and military and civilian marketing personnel access to professional media buying and placement services. The purpose of this request for information (RFI)/sources sought notice is to provide potential offerors; advanced notice of this procurement, gauge interest and receive any feedback or comments in regards to the Performance Work Statement (PWS.) </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Background: </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This SMSP Performance Work Statement (PWS) covers broad requirements for contractor-provided products and services to create, plan, produce, and place advertising in a variety of media including, but not limited to: print, classified, out-of-home, events/venue based, theater, online/search, social media and wireless advertising for participating States and Territories. The ARNG- HRR Marketing branch oversees and manages the program at the national level. The SMSP contractor will utilize existing Army National Guard-approved creative materials as a basis for development of customized/localized media-type-specific creative materials for placement in the individual States and U.S. Territories. States maintain control over their media decisions and the contracted agency tailors their program to the State's needs. No other Government agency has this requirement to the state level, making the task more complex than a larger, centralized national advertising contract. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The following is attached for reference: the draft PWS.</span></p>
<p style="tab-stops: 2.5in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">This notice is not a solicitation as defined by FAR 2.101, and the Government is not requesting offers or proposals at this time. Any responses to this RFI received by the Government will not be accepted to form a binding contract. This is a Request for Information and does not constitute a solicitation or request for proposal and no award will be made as a result of this sources sought notice. If a solicitation is issued, the Government does not guarantee that it will be issued to RFI respondents. The Government is also requesting that restrictive or proprietary markings not be used in response to the RFI.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Please provide a capability statement not to exceed ten (10) pages; which details relevant experience as a prime contract holder which should include; planning, purchasing and placement of local advertising, similar experience in regards to both size (dollar value) and scope, business size, applicable contract vehicles and notice of your intent to propose on this requirement by 5:00 PM (EDT), 30 October 2015.</span></p>

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City office intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with DB Control, 1120 Auburn Street, Fremont, CA, for repair of a G-IV Aircraft Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier (TWTA) for the Aircraft Operations Center at MacDill AFB, FL. The TWTA's are installed on the high altitude research aircraft as an integral part of the Tail Doppler radar (TDR). The TDR is a research tool used for hurricane surveillance and research by the National Weather service and Hurricane Research Division.
<p><br />Sole Source Justification<br />DB Control fabricates TWTA's for various aspects for laboratory and airborne work. DB Control holds copyrights and patents for the design and fabrication of the TWTA's installed on the G-IV aircraft. The TWTA schematic is proprietary and needed for troubleshooting of the amplifier. DB Control possesses specialized test equipment to troubleshoot and repair these units. DB Control remains the sole owner of all intellectual property of all DB control products and processes. Replacement costs for a complete system would be well in excess of $200,000.00. This is NOAA's only spare and failure to repair it could jeopardize NOAA's research and surveillance abilities during hurricane season.</p>
<p>Sources Sought<br />This sources sought notice is not a request for competitive offers and no solicitation package is available. However, firms that believe they can provide the required repairs to the TWTA may submit substantiating documentation in writing within five days of this notice. Responses can be faxed to Shelley Smith at (757) 664-3633 or sent via e-mail to shelley.smith@noaa.gov. Documentation will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to conduct a competitive procurement, based upon response to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.</p>
<p>DOC, Eastern Region Acquisitions Division-Kansas City requires that all contractors doing business with this office be registered with the System for Award Management (SAM). No award can be made to a company not registered in SAM. For additional information and to register in SAM, please access the following web site: www.sam.gov.

<DESC>Intend to award sole source based on FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source.
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center, Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA intends to award on an other than full and open competition basis a firm fixed price (FFP) contract to procure 86 Flight Termination Receivers (FTR) to Kratos-Lancaster, 3061 Industry Dr., Lancaster, PA 17603, manufacturer part number 570006. The delivery schedule is Aug 2016. The FTR is a critical subcomponent of a Flight Termination System (FTS). The FTS used by Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) free flight testing activities has been certified for use in accordance with the Range Commander Council (RCC)-319-99, Flight Termination Systems Commonality Standard. Retention of FTS RCC-319-99 safety certification is necessary for the use of the RCC member range(s) needed for the execution of required JSOW flight test(s). Due to the strict safety requirements of RCC-319-99, only the above mentioned part meets agency needs. These FTS subcomponents are unique to the manufacturer, thus no drop-in-replacement second source exists. Any substitution of a new subcomponent automatically invalidates the RCC-319-99 safety certification for the FTS.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any firm believing it can fulfill the requirement identified above may submit a written response which shall be considered by the agency. The written response shall reference solicitation number N68936-15-R-0066 and provide a capability statement that clearly indicates the firm's experience, assets, background, and ability to perform the required work without compromising the quality, accuracy, reliability, and schedule.</p>
<p>All responsible sources must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database at the following website: https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.</p>
<p>Written responses shall be submitted by e-mail to (melinda.childs@navy.mil) or mailed to Commander, Code 254x00D (Melinda Childs), NAVAIRWARCENWPNSDIV, 429 E. Bowen Rd. Mail Stop 4015, China Lake, CA 93555-6108 and received no later than 13 Oct 2015 at 15:00 PM, PST.</p>

The Contractor will be required to develop and submit for approval a Quality Assurance Program (QAP) and Quality Control Plan (QCP) for this contract.  These documents are to show in detail that Patient Care areas will be assigned as priority and the overall plan to successfully complete snow and deicing operations for the entire Wilmington Campus, as designed within this contract. The QAP/QCP documents are to address weather events that result in the need for snow removal and deicing on the Wilmington Campus to support 24 hour patient care operations.  Contractor shall provide snow removal equipment to include, but not limited to, Contractor owned trucks, snow shovels, various types of plows, loaders, snow blowers, and salt or chemical spreaders.

<CONTACT>Terique Smith , Request for Information: Digital Signal Processing Module , Phone 2027678887, Email terique.smith@nrl.navy.mil
<DESC><strong>SPECIAL NOTICE<br /></strong>This is neither a formal request for proposal (RFP) nor a formal request for <br />quote (RFQ). The Government will not reimburse any costs associated with the <br />development and submission of materials in response to this request. No <br />solicitation is available at this time; however, should such a requirement <br />materialize, no basis for claims against the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) <br />shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or NRL's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing <br />specifications for any subsequent requirement.
<p><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong><br />The Systems Development Section (5744) of the Surface Electronic Warfare Systems Branch (5740) at the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is searching for sources capable of providing a Digital Signal Processing Module. The Digital Signal Processing Module (DSPM) is one functional element of an EW system being developed by NRL. The system level specifications are not articulated in this document, but they have been considered by NRL in the development of the DSPM specification. As an additional constraint in developing this document, NRL has considered those DSP capabilities available from commercial items available within industry. NRL has drafted the specification to ensure that the commercially-available capabilities important to NRL can indeed be utilized when the DSPM is integrated into the NRL EW system and government FPGA programmers implement the system-level functionality.</p>
<p>Without a thorough understanding of the bidder's hardware, it is possible that <br />NRL has stated specifications that are mutually exclusive for the bidder's <br />specific commercial item. It is therefore the bidder's responsibility to define <br />within the proposal any issues with regard to mutually exclusive specifications. <br />The proposal shall detail each issue and propose the bidder's solution.</p>
<p>NRL intends to implement the EW capability utilizing, to the maximum extent <br />possible, a modular open systems approach (MOSA) to enhance supportability and maintainability. Accordingly, this specification relies heavily on several <br />standards approved by the VME Industrial Trade Association (VITA). This <br />specification has attempted to remove ambiguities allowed by these VITA <br />standards, but some may remain. It is the bidder's responsibility to note any <br />ambiguities which this specification does not sufficiently constrain, and what <br />design decisions the bidder plans to make as a result.</p>
<p>In order to aid industry in evaluating their ability to perform the requirement, <br />the following document has been attached and is provided herein this RFI: <br />Draft Statement of Work (SOW) - Digital Signal Processing Module, which is <br />subject to changing. <br /><br /><strong>CONTRACTOR RESPONSE FORMAT</strong><br />The NRL asks that interested parties, at a minimum, supply the following <br />information:<br />a. Name of company and point of contact (POC)<br />b. Telephone number, fax number, address, and e-mail address of POC<br />c. Business size and number of employees<br />d. Capabilities statement, including relevant experience in providing the <br />required supply.</p>
<p><strong>CAPABILITIES STATEMENT</strong> <br />Please provide information about your company's ability to meet the requirements specified in the attached draft requirements document. Please address the following in the Capabilities Statement.<br />1. Pricing, Schedule, and Commerciality Information<br />NRL is requesting interested contractors to provide pricing information for the <br />Digital Signal Processing Module. <br />2. Assumptions<br />Please provide a list of assumptions, if any, which were considered in <br />formulating the response.<br />3. Past Performance Information<br />Please provide in the response a list of Navy, Department of Defense, federal, <br />or commercial contracts supported during the past 36 months, with a brief <br />description of the supply or service provided per each contract.<br /><br /><strong>SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION</strong><br />All information and data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate or proprietary information will be protected as such.<br />Please transmit responses by e-mail to Terique Smith, Contract Specialist, at <br />Terique.Smith@nrl.navy.mil in either Microsoft Office or pdf formats. All <br />responses must be received on or before 12:01 -p.m. (EST),&nbsp;16 October 2015.</p>

<DESC>U.S. NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION<br />FY 2015 Service Contract Inventory Reporting Fact Sheet
<p>On December 31, 2013, the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council issued a rule, effective January 30, 2014, requiring contractors to begin reporting the total amount invoiced and the direct labor hours expended on the services performed under certain contracts. These changes are required by Section 743 of Division C of the FY 2010 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 111-117).</p>
<p>The information is collected through the System for Award Management (SAM) and included in the agency service contract inventory. Contractors are encouraged to review the information below and to make note of reporting dates and deliverables to ensure their compliance with the law and regulation.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION:</strong> What contracts are covered by the new Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) rule?<br /><strong>RESPONSE</strong>: For FY 2015, reporting is required according to the following thresholds (see FAR 4.1703).<br />&bull; All cost-reimbursement, time-and-materials, and labor-hour service contracts and orders with an estimated total value above the simplified acquisition threshold ($150,000).<br />&bull; All fixed-price service contracts awarded or issued with an estimated total value of $1 million or greater.<br />Note - the rule applies to contracts awarded by executive agencies covered by the Federal Activities Inventory Reform (FAIR) Act (P.L. 105-270), except the Department of Defense.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Are subcontractors required to report?<br /><strong>RESPONSE:</strong> First-tier subcontracts for services will be reported using the same thresholds (see FAR 4.1703).</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: How are indefinite-delivery contracts handled?<br /><strong>RESPONSE</strong>: For indefinite-delivery contracts, reporting requirements will be determined based on the expected dollar amount and type of orders issued under the contracts. Indefinite delivery contracts include, but are not limited to, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts, Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts, Government-wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs), and other multi-agency contracts.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: What is the purpose of collecting the information, including the invoiced amounts and direct labor hours?<br /><strong>RESPONSE</strong>: Service contract inventories are a management tool that are designed to help agencies better understand how contractors are being used to support the mission and whether contractors' skills are being used appropriately. The agencies analyze the data to determine if the mix of Federal employees and contractors is effective or if rebalancing is needed. Information on the total amount invoiced and the direct labor hours expended, when combined with other market research information and, where available, benchmarking data, can help to support agency efforts to eliminate costly duplicative service contracts in favor of more affordable solutions by providing insight into the relative cost-effectiveness and efficiency of contracted work.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Will the information on amount invoiced and direct labor hours be made public? <br /><strong>RESPONSE</strong>: Yes. Consistent with Section 743, agencies will include this information in their annual inventories, which also include a description of the work performed, the name of the vendor and the total dollar value of the contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: When must contractors provide their data on amount invoiced and direct labor hours? <br /><strong>RESPONSE</strong>: In accordance with the new rule, contractors performing on covered contracts must report their information in SAM between October 10 and November 30, 2015. NRC will review contractor input and work with them to make any necessary corrections by January 31, 2016. This is the date that SAM will permanently close and no more information can be submitted.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: What happens if a contractor fails to work with the agency to provide the required data in a timely manner?<br /><strong>RESPONSE</strong>: The contracting officer is expected to make the contractor's failure to comply with the reporting requirements a part of the contractor's performance information under FAR Subpart 42.15.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>: Where can I find the complete text of the rule for reporting on amount invoiced and direct labor hours?<br /><strong>RESPONSE</strong>: The Federal Register notice was published on December 31, 2013. The link to the notice is <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/31/2013-31148/federal-acquisition-regulation-service-contracts-reporting-requirements">https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/12/31/2013-31148/federal-acquisition-regulation-service-contracts-reporting-requirements</a>.</p>

<p>This synopsis provides notice of the U.S. Department of Labor's (DOL) intent to solicit a proposal on a sole source basis from the incumbent Adams and Associates, Inc. (herein known as "Adams" located at 10395 Double R Blvd., Reno, NV<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>89521 that will provide operation services for the Red Rock Job Corps Center.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The statutory authority permitting acquisition of this requirement by other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Center is a 24-hour, 7 days per week operation that provides essential residential (including food and shelter), medical, education, training, and career transition support to approximately 244 residential students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This acquisition will result in a stand-alone, cost-plus-fixed fee (CPFF), bridge contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed bridge contract is needed for continuing on-going operational services while the follow-on action is being prepared.</p>
<p>Adams is the only immediate practical source for providing the necessary continuation of services by previously trained staff without causing a break or any disruption in work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The present operator has established connections and partnerships with various educational, civic and employer partners in the surrounding communities that could be unfairly interrupted and cause difficulties for the students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It si unrealistic, from a technical and contractual perspective, to expect any other potential source to provide continued services for a short period of performance prior to the competitive solicitation and ultimate contract to be awarded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, to conduct an operator transition while the requirement is being re-competed and another transition once the new contract award is in place would be very costly to the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, due to the nature of this requirement and the impracticality and substantial costs the Government could incur and not recover through competition, center operation services will be procured on a sole source basis as the aforementioned bridge contract.</p>
<p>For those reasons as stated above, THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although firms can respond to this notice with a Capability Statement, the Government has the discretion to proceed with the sole source or not.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The procurement will be classified under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 611519, Other Technical and Trade Schools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No solicitation document exists for this requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Parties interested in responding to this notice are invited to submit a capability statement which includes sufficient details for consideration by the Government, including costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Responses must be emailed to: desilets.paul@dol.gov.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>THE SUBJECT LINE OF YOUR EMAIL MUST STATE:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Special Notice DOL-ETA-15-N-00060 Red Rock JCC Operations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Responses are due no later than October 20, 2015 at 2:00 P.M.

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent, not a request for proposal. The National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIH/NIAID) intends to negotiate on the basis of other than full and open competition with Fisher Bioservices, Inc., 14665 Rothgeb Dr., Rockville, Maryland 20850-5312 off-site freezer storage, maintenance, monitoring, pick-up and delivery of biological specimens to and from NIAID DIR in Bethesda and Rockville, Maryland. <br /><strong>See attached statement of work and Equipment inventory information for further details</strong>. <br />The Period of performance will be November 1, 2015 - October 31, 2016. The FOB Destination, Bethesda, Maryland 20892. <br /><br />It is not feasible to transfer material at this time due to the sensitivity and history of the specimens held at the current facility. In order to relocate the current allotment of 18 freezers, its contents, the materials stored in 6 liquid nitrogen units, and the materials located in ambient storage units would not only be hazardous to the stored specimens but would be logistically problematic to transfer specimens and equipment in this quantity. A mass transfer of stored specimens, increases the risk of damaging critical research material by not maintaining the optimum temperature and would be costly to the Government. <br />The statutory authority for this sole source requirement is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 only one source available, no substitutions possible. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. <br />All responsible sources may submit offers that will be considered by this agency. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br /><strong>All offers shall be submitted no later than 4:00 p.m. (ET) October 19, 2015 via electronic submission - email to Sylvia Robinson at srobinson@niaid.nih.gov. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The email subject line must begin with and include solicitation# NIAID-NOI-16-1759797</span>. </strong>Fax submissions are not acceptable. <br />

<DESC>The objective is to establish a five-year contract with companies having the capacity and capabilities to store, inspect, operate, transport, stage, and sustain United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Veterinary Services, National Veterinary Stockpile (NVS) supplies and equipment ensuring it is operational and deployable at all times. The contractor shall possess general experience in providing emergency response services to successfully respond to a range of agricultural and all-hazards emergencies. The contractor shall demonstrate their ability to maintain a highly skilled and trained staff.
<p>APHIS uses Incident Command Structure (ICS) to adapt to the complexity and demands of any single incident or multiple incidents; therefore, contractors shall demonstrate the ability to operate among various jurisdictions and functional agencies, both public and private.</p>
<p>The NVS' ability to deploy within 24 hours large amounts of critical veterinary resources ensures States have what they need to respond to catastrophes and other outbreaks.</p>
<p>The NVS deploys products like animal vaccine, antivirals, equipment, or therapeutic products to appropriately respond to damaging animal diseases affecting human health and the economy that are likely to be unavailable in sufficient quantities for large outbreaks. States, industries (as part of the incident command system), and NVS commercial partners shall use the products and related equipment to respond to large-scale outbreaks.</p>
<p>The NVS currently partners with commercial companies to store and maintain its inventory in multiple locations and in sufficient volume to ensure its ability to respond to multiple, large-scale, simultaneous animal disease outbreaks. The partners are referred to as 3D contractors or 3D commercial partners; 3D is the acronym for "depopulation, disposal, and decontamination" and represents activities commonly demanding rapid deployment of large numbers of response personnel and equipment. The 3D contractors are highly trained in emergency response, and are self-sufficient with their own equipment and supplies. The contractors can deploy within 24 hours and supply 500-600 people within 3 days and 1,000 people within a week. The NVS program serves as the single point of contact for 3D response support services. Upon request, 3D commercial partners may deploy and operate the equipment in response to animal disease outbreak(s).</p>
<p>Upon approval, request for assistance by a State, Tribe, or Territories, the NVS may deploy the equipment as a stand-alone package or request commercial partners (3D) deploy and operate the equipment.</p>
<p>Irrespective of who operates the equipment, the NVS must have methods to adequately store and maintain equipment between deployments and to ensure equipment is repaired or reconditioned after deployments to ensure it is ready for the next deployment.</p>

<p>52.209-5 CERTIFICATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (APR 2010)<br />(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that-<br />(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals-<br />(A) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(B) Have [ ] have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have," the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation);<br />(C) Are [ ] are not [ ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in subdivision (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and<br />(D) Have [ ], have not [ ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(2) Examples.<br />(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(ii) The Offeror has [ ] has not [ ], within a 3-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency.<br />(2) Principal, for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions).<br />THIS CERTIFICATION CONCERNS A MATTER WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF AN AGENCY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE MAKING OF A FALSE, FICTITIOUS, OR FRAUDULENT CERTIFICATION MAY RENDER THE MAKER SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION UNDER SECTION 1001, TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE.<br />(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<br />(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible.<br />(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.<br />(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<br />52.209-7 INFORMATION REGARDING RESPONSIBILITY MATTERS (JUL 2013)<br />(a) Definitions. As used in this provision-<br />"Administrative proceeding" means a non-judicial process that is adjudicatory in nature in order to make a determination of fault or liability (e.g., Securities and Exchange Commission Administrative Proceedings, Civilian Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings, and Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals Proceedings).

The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.<br />(h) Multiple awards.

<p><br />52.252-1 SOLICITATION PROVISIONS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE (FEB 1998)<br />This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.

<p>(a) The Contractor warrants that, to the best of the Contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, or that the Contractor has disclosed all such relevant information.<br />(b) The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential organizational conflict of interest is<br />discovered after award, the Contractor will make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting<br />Officer. This disclosure shall include a description of actions which the Contractor has taken or<br />proposes to take, after consultation with the Contracting Officer, to avoid, mitigate, or neutralize<br />the actual or potential conflict.<br />(c) The Government may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an organizational conflict of interest.

<p><br />FAR 52.204-13 System for Award Management Maintenance (JUL 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this clause-</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and Government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see Subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes- <br />(1) Data collected from prospective Federal awardees required for the conduct of business with the Government;</p>
<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR Subpart 4.14; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c) (1) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>
<p>(d) Contractors may obtain additional information on registration and annual confirmation requirements at http://www.acquisition.gov.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK
Purchase of Nikon TS100-F LED microscope
System Description 
The Nikon TS100-F LED microscope is a specialized microscope designed specifically to study specimens using bright, high-resolution imaging techniques. This equipment is modular to enable customization to suit specific research needs.  This instrument set up includes the main body TS100-F LED microscope, dust cover, 22 mm FOV eyepieces, condenser with 75mm/0.3 working distance and phase contrast, phase contrast slider, disascopic LED illumination, objectives (4x achromat brightfield, 10x achromat phase contrast, 20x achromat phase contrast), DSFi2 5 megapixel color camera, camera control unit, support kit, attachable mechanical stage, slide glass/petri dish holder, and universal adjustable holder for petri dishes, slides, plates.
This equipment is necessary for conducting research on cells used in our unique in vitro based assays.  The specialized nature of this particular piece of equipment is essential for our research, which requires continual monitoring and imaging of cells used in our in vitro based assays.  In addition, all other imaging instrumentation and software available in the laboratory is supplied by Nikon, therefore in order to maintain continuity of research a Nikon brand microscope system is required. The sophisticated technology offered by this instrumentation is not currently available to our laboratory at the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center Research Service.
While the Nikon TS100-F LED microscope is electronic with a digital display, no separate computer is needed and the instrument will not have any internet connections and will not be connected through the VA network.  In addition, the equipment is for cell culture and in vitro use only and will not be used on human patients. No patient-identifiable information will be entered or stored on the system.
Clinical Utility
The Nikon TS100-F LED microscope is a specialized microscope system that is not currently available for use by our laboratory.  This product will be used for in vitro assays only and will not be used on human subjects.  This instrument is a complex, highly specialized technology that is essential for obtaining bright, high-resolution images of our in vitro cultures and assays by allowing us to examine cell viability, morphology, cell count, and confluency. To our knowledge there is currently no similar instrumentation that includes the same features and allows for the continuity of research necessary for our experiments that is provided by the Nikon TS100-F LED microscope system.  This system includes Eco-illumination that uses LEDs to provide enough brightness for phase contrast and also reduces the frequency of expensive lamp replacement. The CF160 optical system provides sharp, clear images while allowing longer working distances and higher apertures. This system comes with a photo port and DSFi2 5 megapixel color camera, which is a stand-alone digital camera that captures and saves images without the need for a PC or internet connection and imaging is controlled by the touch pad on the control unit. The apodized phase contrast method utilized by the Nikon TS100F improves vision by reducing the halo effect to allow for more clear observation of cell division activities and allows for viewing of finer details with thick specimens. The mechanical stage allows for controlled movement of specimen plates while enabling the counting of cells in each well of a 96-well plate, which is essential towards our very specialized single hematopoietic stem cell transplantation experiments. The adaptability of the Nikon TS100F is another necessity as it allows for the addition of micromanipulators, multiple types of specimen plate holders, and auxiliary stages to allow for viewing of larger specimens.

The C&A requirements do not apply. A Security Accreditation Package is not required. 

The vendor must be able to supply instrumentation to meet the following specifications:
1.	Nikon instrumentation for continuity of research
2.	Real-time data to view parameters on screen
3.	Built-in display, with no requirement for a separate computer
4.	Upgradable, modular system that can be customized and expanded to meet specific needs over time
5.	Data export ability
6.	The ability to view and download history
7.	Immediately display live images and display customized scale bar conditions
8.	"Fly-eye" optics to insure even illumination across the field of view
9.	Long working distance with higher numerical aperture
10.	ADL phase designed to reduce "halo" and increase image contrast
11.	Ultra-stability through vibration free stage design
12.	Availability of custom filter cubes
13.	Direct projection of image to detector maximizing light efficiency
14.	Unique stage with window to view objectives
15.	5 megapixel color camera with recordable pixels 2560x1920, 1280x960, 640x480
16.	ISO sensitivity equivalent to ISO64
17.	Exposure times from 1/1000 sec. to 600 sec.
18.	Live display mode with high resolution (2560x1920, 1280x960)
19.	Include vibration isolation platform
20.	Include attachable mechanical stages for 96 well plates, 139x97 mm vessel holders, 1x3 glass slides and petri dish holders (54 mm)
21.	Universal adjustable holder for petri dishes up to 65 mm, and Terasaki plates

<CONTACT>William Corson

<a href="mailto:WILLIAM.CORSON@VA.GOV">WILLIAM.CORSON@VA.GOV</a>
<DESC>CONTRACT TITLE.
Purchase of allopurinol, USP

1.	BACKGROUND.
The VACSPCRPCC must purchase allopurinol, USP Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (Allopurinol API) to manufacture 100 mg, 300 mg and 400 mg allopurinol tablets (Product) for VA research clinical trial CSP594 to study the use of allopurinol and febuxostat in veterans suffering from gout.  This new VACSPCRPCC clinical trial that is expected to provide patients with allopurinol tablets.
2.	SCOPE.
This is a contract for the purchase of Allopurinol API which will be used to manufacture Product for VA research clinical trial CSP594, with option quantities for purchase during four additional years.    The amount of Allopurinol API to be purchased will be variable and could range from a minimum order of approximately 25 kgs a year to the maximum order indicated under item number 1, Schedule of Services and/or Supplies.
Because each vendor's product has different physical characteristics which impact how we manufacture the product in addition to characteristics of the finished tablets, we must use the same vendor for the life of the study.  Switching Allopurinol API vendors in the middle of the study will require extensive additional costs that have not been budgeted for items such as revising regulatory submissions to the Food and Drug Administration, reformulating the product because it has different physical characteristics, additional stability testing, etc.
Delivery time is an important factor as a long delivery time would delay the study.  Purchasing from the company with the longer time frame would extend the study start-up date past our mid-March ship date.  This would delay the start of a multi-million dollar study, delay veterans from obtaining the study drug and potentially impact jobs at the clinical locations.
The proposed schedule includes time for Allopurinol API procurement; formulating or preparing the recipe for each Product (3 active and 3 placebo); the manufacture of pilot placebo batches for each Product; the manufacture of pilot batches for each of the three strengths of allopurinol Product; analytical testing for each Product and placebo; stability testing for each Product to determine how long the Product meets its specifications, and the manufacture, bottling, packaging and shipping of each Product and matching placebo to clinical sites throughout the U.S. in time for the initial patient enrollment. In addition the CSPCRPCC will be manufacturing other products in this time period.
The Allopurinol API manufacturer must hold a Drug Master File (DMF) with the Food and Drug Administration.  A DMF describes to the FDA the manufacturing processes and quality systems the vendor uses to manufacture the Allopurinol API.  There are many vendors of Allopurinol API that do not have DMFs with the FDA.  We cannot purchase from them for quality and safety reasons.  Holding a DMF with the FDA provides the first layer of assurance that we will provide our veterans with tablets that meet our quality expectations and requirements.  Because the VA does not buy commercial tablets and capsules manufactured in India or China, we also cannot buy active ingredient manufactured in India or China.  
Many Allopurinol API manufacturers sell product in the U.S. solely through a distributor.  Thus the purchase may be directly with the manufacturer or indirectly through the distributor.

"	Enables your nurses to practice autonomously in any unit at any time by building confidence in their decisions through delivery of quick, relevant and authoritative answers within their workflow.
"	Contributes a conduit to integrate a culture of evidence-based best practice into your institution's framework.
"	Makes appropriate patient teaching readily available at all times with patient education for every entry.
"	Provides a tool for patient care planning.
"	Ensures staff is referencing the same content at all times.

With staff trained on both products, they have the ability to cross reference both products.  Only one other product is comparable, Elsevier's Mosby Nursing Skills which we already have, which the Library Network Office is now supplying to all VA facilities.  A major reason why our nursing staff wants to stay with Lippincott is the time saved by knowing, accepting and approving the 1400 "Lippincott Standard Procedures" list.  This approved list allows nursing staff to take expert care of patients at the bedside immediately.  
Procedures and Advisor is a point-of-care database.  The content creation is evidenced-based, peer-reviewed, and current.  Procedures offers a full series of behavioral health procedures.  Procedures are updated annually.  All procedures have the evidence-based references cited at the end of the procedure.  Multiple references are used versus only on textbook source like Mosby's.  Procedures offers a full election in all the specialty areas needed to practice in a hospital setting.  User testing demonstrates that the name of LWW sections and the tabs used to navigate LWW product are very user-friendly and intuitive.  Procedures clearly focuses on quick point of care access by helping the nurse get in, get the information he/she needs, and get out without a lot of unnecessary scanning which is detrimental to the care of the patient.  The procedure view in Procedures can be customized based on the elements the customer want to view or print (i.e. equipment, implementation, etc.).  Procedures offers quicker and more accurate searching with advanced search functionality.  Since this is a point-of-care; evidence based database it helps nurses and other clinical staff make life and death decisions with the patient population.  Lippincott has also partnered with Joint Commission Resources publishing group who will help edit specific Lippincott Nursing Solution content as this is not the case with Mosby.

(a) Method of payment.
(1) All payments by the Government under this contract shall be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this clause. As used in this clause, the term "EFT" refers to the funds transfer and may also include the payment information transfer.
(2) In the event the Government is unable to release one or more payments by EFT, the Contractor agrees to either-
(i) Accept payment by check or some other mutually agreeable method of payment; or
(ii) Request the Government to extend the payment due date until such time as the Government can make payment by EFT (but see paragraph (d) of this clause).
(b) Contractor's EFT information. The Government shall make payment to the Contractor using the EFT information contained in the System for Award Management (SAM) database. In the event that the EFT information changes, the Contractor shall be responsible for providing the updated information to the SAM database. 
(c) Mechanisms for EFT payment. The Government may make payment by EFT through either the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network, subject to the rules of the National Automated Clearing House Association, or the Fedwire Transfer System. The rules governing Federal payments through the ACH are contained in 31 CFR Part 210. 
(d) Suspension of payment. If the Contractor's EFT information in the SAM database is incorrect, then the Government need not make payment to the Contractor under this contract until correct EFT information is entered into the SAM database; and any invoice or contract financing request shall be deemed not to be a proper invoice for the purpose of prompt payment under this contract. The prompt payment terms of the contract regarding notice of an improper invoice and delays in accrual of interest penalties apply. 
(e) Liability for uncompleted or erroneous transfers.
(1) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Government used the Contractor's EFT information incorrectly, the Government remains responsible for-
(i) Making a correct payment;
(ii) Paying any prompt payment penalty due; and
(iii) Recovering any erroneously directed funds.
(2) If an uncompleted or erroneous transfer occurs because the Contractor's EFT information was incorrect, or was revised within 30 days of Government release of the EFT payment transaction instruction to the Federal Reserve System, and-
(i) If the funds are no longer under the control of the payment office, the Government is deemed to have made payment and the Contractor is responsible for recovery of any erroneously directed funds; or
(ii) If the funds remain under the control of the payment office, the Government shall not make payment, and the provisions of paragraph (d) of this clause shall apply.
(f) EFT and prompt payment. A payment shall be deemed to have been made in a timely manner in accordance with the prompt payment terms of this contract if, in the EFT payment transaction instruction released to the Federal Reserve System, the date specified for settlement of the payment is on or before the prompt payment due date, provided the specified payment date is a valid date under the rules of the Federal Reserve System. 
(g) EFT and assignment of claims. If the Contractor assigns the proceeds of this contract as provided for in the assignment of claims terms of this contract, the Contractor shall require as a condition of any such assignment, that the assignee shall register separately in the SAM database and shall be paid by EFT in accordance with the terms of this clause. Notwithstanding any other requirement of this contract, payment to an ultimate recipient other than the Contractor, or a financial institution properly recognized under an assignment of claims pursuant to Subpart 32.8, is not permitted. In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor. EFT information that shows the ultimate recipient of the transfer to be other than the Contractor, in the absence of a proper assignment of claims acceptable to the Government, is incorrect EFT information within the meaning of paragraph (d) of this clause. 
(h) Liability for change of EFT information by financial agent. The Government is not liable for errors resulting from changes to EFT information made by the Contractor's financial agent. 
(i) Payment information. The payment or disbursing office shall forward to the Contractor available payment information that is suitable for transmission as of the date of release of the EFT instruction to the Federal Reserve System. The Government may request the Contractor to designate a desired format and method(s) for delivery of payment information from a list of formats and methods the payment office is capable of executing. However, the Government does not guarantee that any particular format or method of delivery is available at any particular payment office and retains the latitude to use the format and delivery method most convenient to the Government. If the Government makes payment by check in accordance with paragraph (a) of this clause, the Government shall mail the payment information to the remittance address contained in the SAM database.

<DESC>COMBINED SYNOPSIS SOLICITATION

i.	This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The government anticipates a single (all or none), firm fixed price award.  A quotation is not an offer and, consequently, cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Therefore, issuance by the Government of an order in response to a supplier's quotation does not establish a contract. The order is an offer by the Government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when the supplier accepts the offer.

ii.	VA101V-16-Q-0003

iii.	The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-83.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

There is no paragraph 3.3.2.2.3 in the SOW.  Please confirm that SOW paragraph 3.3.2.2.2. Measurement Interface Equipment, is the correct reference for these CLINs.                                                                                                                                                                    Response to Question #37 <br> SOW paragraph 3.3.2.2.2. Measurement Interface Equipment, is the correct reference for CLINs 0016, 0016AA, and 0016AB.  Section B has been updated accordingly. <br>  <br> Question #38 <br> Reference Section H-Special Contract Requirements, 52.211-11, Liquidated Damages-Supplies, Services, or Research and Development which states,  quote mark (a) If the Contractor fails to deliver the supplies or perform the services within the time specified in this contract, the Contractor shall, in place of actual damages, pay to the Government liquidated damages of new FWS-CS units delivered to the Government, including coverage of transportation and shipping fees, or other goods/services agreed upon by the Government. Consideration shall be resolved between the contractor and the Government within 30 days after first missed delivery against the contract baseline schedule, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Government. Consideration may require the initiation of a new delivery order from the Government to close consideration. <br>  <br> The consideration formula is as follows: <br>  <br>  _(i=1)^n  (Unit Cost * Total Systems Delinquent for Monthi * Fielding Factor for Monthi)   <br>  <br> The fielding factor for a given month's delinquent delivery will be determined based on the following criteria: <br> Fielding Factor             Number of Days Until Fielding <br> 1%                                                 180 <br> 2%                                                90- 179 <br> 3%                                                32-89 <br> 5%                                                 31 quote mark  <br>  <br> Please confirm our calculation of Liquidated Damages based upon the following scenario: <br> Schedule Date:  8/31/2016 <br> Fielding Date:  9/30/2016 <br> Delivery Date:  8/31/2017 <br> System Unit Price of $1 <br> Number of Systems: 10 <br> Total Contract Price for 10 systems: $10 <br>  <br> Liquidated Damages are calculated to be $6. <br> If our interpretation of this clause is correct, doesn't it operate more as a penalty clause than one that compensates the Government for its reasonable damages for late delivery? <br>  <br> Response to Question #38 <br> Based on the consideration formula as cited, the calculation of liquidated damages for the scenario described would be $6 to compensate the Government for a one year delay in delivery.   <br>  <br> Question #39 <br> Reference Section H-Special Contract Requirements, 52.211-11, Liquidated Damages-Supplies, Services, or Research and Development which states,  quote mark (a) If the Contractor fails to deliver the supplies or perform the services within the time specified in this contract, the Contractor shall, in place of actual damages, pay to the Government liquidated damages of new FWS-CS units delivered to the Government, including coverage of transportation and shipping fees, or other goods/services agreed upon by the Government. Consideration shall be resolved between the contractor and the Government within 30 days after first missed delivery against the contract baseline schedule, unless otherwise agreed upon by the Government. Consideration may require the initiation of a new delivery order from the Government to close consideration. <br>  <br> The consideration formula is as follows: <br>  <br>  _(i=1)^n  (Unit Cost * Total Systems Delinquent for Monthi * Fielding Factor for Monthi)   <br>  <br> The fielding factor for a given month's delinquent delivery will be determined based on the following criteria: <br>  <br> Fielding Factor             Number of Days Until Fielding <br>  <br> 1%                                                 180 <br> 2%                                                90- 179 <br> 3%                                                32-89 <br> 5%                                                 31 quote mark  <br>  <br> To bound the risk to the contractor: <br>  <br> a.  Would the Government consider eliminating the  quote mark fielding factor quote mark  component as that factor is beyond the control of the contractor and in its place tie it to  <br> a  quote mark delivery factor quote mark  which would be tied to the contractual delivery schedule? <br>  <br> b.  Would the Government consider limiting the total amount of Liquidated Damages that can be assessed under the contract to $1,000,000? <br>  <br> c.  Would the Government consider limiting the amount of Liquidated Damages that can be assessed under the contract to 5% of the price of the delinquent unit? <br>  <br> Response to Question #39 <br>  <br> The formula in Section H has been modified to eliminate the fielding factor.

STATEMENT OF WORK
Title of Project:   Post-Stroke Contributors to Increased Energetic Cost and Decreased Gait Stability

1.	Introduction: We require a device which is able to quantify the ground reaction forces between an individual and the environment under their feet. In order to understand how individuals generate efficient propulsion, and how stroke survivors differ from uninjured controls, we must be able to accurately measure these forces. Importantly, due to the force-generating asymmetries common among stroke survivors, we must be able to quantify such forces independently for the two legs. A dual-surface portable force place is required in order to accomplish this task.

2.	Background:  Every year, approximately 15,000 American veterans experience a stroke, with an estimated cost of acute and follow-up care in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Following a stroke, the restoration or improvement of walking is a high-ranking goal among patients, but only about half of the population is able to return to typical levels of community ambulation. The resultant decrease in independent mobility is strongly associated with a decline in quality of life. Two factors which strongly contribute to decreased independent mobility are decreases in gait stability and increases in the energetic cost of walking. However, the underlying cause of these changes is currently unclear. To help injured veterans return to a typical level of function, it is necessary to investigate how post-stroke changes in neural control accuracy contribute to decreases in gait stability and increases in energetic cost. One possible contributing factor to post-stroke increases in energetic cost is a reduced ability to generate efficient propulsion during walking. Due to the mechanical complexity of bipedal gait, part of our work will focus on performance of a simplified task which better allows us to quantify the ability of each leg to generate power efficiently. To do so, we must purchase a device which allows us to accurately quantify the forces produced simultaneously by the paretic and non-paretic legs during a simple "bouncing-like" task. This device must be portable to allow it to be integrated with the reclined sled we use to ensure that a wide range of stroke survivors will be able to participate. The resulting knowledge will serve as the basis for the development of novel gait rehabilitation techniques, which has the potential to increase the quality of life of thousands of veterans and save millions of dollars. 

3.	Scope of Work:  The purchased device must be portable and able to be integrated with an existing mechanical frame. The device must consist of independent force-measuring surfaces so we are able to quantify leg performance for each of the paretic and non-paretic legs. The device must also be accompanied by easy-to-use custom software so the output can be integrated with existing laboratory measurements.

4.	Applicable Directives: The properties of the device are detailed in Section 5 below. There are no other contractor requirements.

5.	Performance Requirements: The device must be light-weight and portable, so that it can be rigidly attached to an existing steel frame as part of a reclined sled mechanism. To allow a rigid, secure attachment, the device must thus share a single base which can be bolted to the frame. While we require a single base, we also require two separate force-measuring surfaces, which will allow us to measure the forces produced by the two legs independently. The device must allow measurement of all three force directions and all three moment directions, allowing us to quantify any shear forces and the center of pressure location. The device must be easy-to-use, including custom written software, so individuals not trained as engineers will be rapidly be able to use the device. 

6.	Deliverables: The contractor will be expected to provide the purchased device within 60 work days, and provide necessary calibration and maintenance over the following year.

<DESC><p><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought Notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Specialty Surgical Sponges. This is not a request for quote or proposal. The MMESO West is the lead MMESO for this project.</strong></p>
<p>These Specialty Surgical Sponges products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access its web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.</p>
<p>This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2 for Specialty Surgical Sponges. All items proposed to be included in this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the certification in the DAPA Management System (DMS). The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (as defined by FAR 52.225-5), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Maryann DiMeo at DLA Troop Support, maryann.dimeo@dla.mil, 215-737-3201.</p>
<p>The QSL for Specialty Surgical Sponges will be established approximately March 2016 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. Qualified vendors will be invited approximately April 2016 to submit pricing proposals to enter into an Incentive Agreement for Specialty Surgical Sponges. The government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Specialty Surgical Sponges.</p>
<p>A. Products &amp; Performance Required. <br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Specialty Surgical Sponges. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $306,718.00. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Seven items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 43.2% ($132,516) of the total volume in sales ($306,718). The specifications for this project are shown in "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.</p>
<p>B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must provide an e-mail response to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's responses must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; and (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time should a problem occur with the first submission. <br />As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL", vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, email or hard copy). <br /><strong>Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Pacific Daylight Time (PST) on the date listed for closing in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the instant QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action. </strong></p>
<p>C. Source Selection Procedures <br />The MMESO Joint Product Review Board (JPRB) will serve as the forum for clinical recommendations for product selection and coordinate logistics efforts in support of DoD Components. The board is chaired by Designated Senior Logisticians (DSLs) and co-chaired by Designated Senior Clinicians (DSCs) in the MMESO Areas of Responsibility (AORs) and includes clinicians and logisticians for MTFs within each MMESO. The Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) members are the deciding officials for this initiative. The MMESO DSLs and DSCs intend to review responses and evaluate products for selection to the QSL IAW FAR 9.2.</p>

<p>In addition, no Contractor or subcontractor employee shall be permitted to perform work under this contract if listed on the HHS Office of Inspector General List of Excluded Individuals/Entities (LEIE), http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov.

<p>8.  STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 14 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The IT Business Analyst is a member of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI's Information Technology team in the Operations and Management Division, reports to the OTI Senior Information Technology Team Leader or his/her designee, and is based in Washington, DC. OTI currently has five teams as part of its Operations and Management Division: Finance, Human Resources (HR), Information Technology (IT), Office Support and Travel. The Business Analyst's principal responsibilities include supporting several projects for USAID and OTI's technical authority for all facets of operational assistance such as finance, HR, grants management and enterprise workflow; and performing business analysis and architecture development in support of customers and provide data expertise to be able to trace data through the system and assess the quality of data at each transform and interface of the business process. This effort will include, but is not limited to, the analysis of existing processes/reverse engineering; elicitation, analyses, and management of requirements; and development of Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) documents. Individuals in this position are also responsible for providing the day-to-day project management for a small team, including customer communications, expectations settings and timeline deliverable monitoring and risk management.</p>
<p>A successful candidate will demonstrate sound judgment, excellent written and oral communication skills, including the ability to communicate technical topics to management and non-technical audiences, as well as interface with the customer on a daily basis. The candidate should possess exceptional analytical and critical thinking abilities and proven ability to successfully manage the delivery and execution of high quality, multiple work assignments on schedule and with minimal direction.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The work of the IT Business Analyst requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success.

The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID.

<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Lease Space Using Other Than Full and Open Competition<br /><br />The United States Government currently occupies office space under lease in Ravenna, Ohio. The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.<br /><br />The Government requests office and related space yielding a minimum of 150 s.f. to a maximum of 175 s.f. ANSI/BOMA (ABOA) square feet and 2 adjacent parking spaces. The space must be located in Portage County Ohio; within an area bordered on the North by Interstate 76, the Portage County Line on the East, on the South -&nbsp;Interstate 76 &amp; 80, and on the West - County Road 43. All services, supplies, utilities, partitioning and tenant alternations must be included as part of the rental consideration. The lease term requested is 5 years, 3 years firm term.<br /><br />To submit a location for inspection, contact this office no later than 4:30 pm CST by October 23, 2015. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to determine the interest, costs, and availability of space.

<CONTACT>Azita Mamdouhi, Email azita.mamdouhi@occ.treas.gov
<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters, regulates, and supervises all United States national banks and federal savings associations (thrifts). OCC also supervises the federal branches and agencies of foreign banks. Headquartered in Washington, DC, the OCC has four district offices plus an office in London to supervise the international activities of national banks. Bank supervision is the core activity of the agency.
<p>In support of its mission to ensure a safe, sound, and competitive banking system, the OCC employs a range of sophisticated applications, business systems, and databases. Deployed assets range from point-solution applications to enterprise services, including web content management, document management, records management, knowledge management, identity management, notification services, data management and analytics, and enterprise-wide security operations. To enable its business units to easily and independently access and use these information assets, the OCC provides a secure, high-availability data delivery platform that offers the technical infrastructure and services required to process, share, and secure the large volume of highly-sensitive data used by the OCC workforce. Information Technology Infrastructure Support Services (ITISS) provides contracted IT support services with a customer-focused service delivery model based upon ITSM principles. A range of engineering, operations, and technical support services are provided via an efficient, performance-based contract that leverages an optimized Contractor skill mix for core services, augmented by a proven, agile, just-in-time approach to the provision of surge support and subject matter expert (SME) capabilities. The effort necessitates a high-performing, collaborative partnership between the Contractor and Government personnel.<br /><br />To assist the OCC in identifying potential sources that possess the specific expertise, capabilities and experience <strong>please carefully read and respond to the attached document titled, IT Infrastructure Capabilities Questionnaire</strong>. All companies must provide responses to the six (6) questions identified in the <strong>IT Infrastructure Capabilities Questionnaire</strong>. In addition, the OCC is seeking feedback regarding the draft <strong>ITISS Performance Work Statement</strong> (attached). Respondents may provide input to the PWS to include what should be added, deleted, or changed. If companies pursue this option in addition to responding to the <strong>IT Infrastructure Capabilities Questionnaire, the response should be no more than 20 pages total, 12 point font, double spaced. <br /></strong><br />The OCC is interested in identifying vendors who are capable of offering the services outlined in the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) for ITISS. <strong>THE GOVERNMENT IS&nbsp;SEEKING RESPONSES FROM SMALL BUSINESSES</strong>. Furthermore, the responses obtained will enable the OCC to refine the strategy for the development of this requirement in order to structure a program that will mitigate cost, schedule, and performance risks. The projected NAICS for this procurement is <strong>541513 Computer Facilities Management Services</strong>.<br /><br />The Government reserves the right to reject in whole or in part, any industry input, as a result of this Notice.<br /><br />Failure to provide sufficient documentation may result in the Government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. When submitting responses, vendors shall clearly identify any information it considers sensitive or proprietary. All information received in response to this Notice that is marked &lsquo;proprietary' will be handled accordingly. Responses to this Notice will not be returned. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated and incurred by submitting a response. Eligibility to participate in a future acquisition is not predicated on a response to this Notice.<br /><br /><strong>SUBMISSION INFORMATION</strong><br />All responses shall be submitted to Azita Mamdouhi, via email at Azita.Mamdouhi@occ.treas.gov <strong>no later than 10:00 a.m. EST, on October 30, 2015</strong>. Should you have any questions or concerns, please email Azita Mamdouhi only. Phone calls will not be taken and must be received via email only.<br /><br /><strong>DISCLAIMER AND IMPORTANT NOTES</strong>: This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in this response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work. Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted. After a review of the responses received, a pre-solicitation synopsis and solicitation may be published in Federal Business Opportunities. However, responses to this notice will not be considered adequate responses to a solicitation.</p>

<AWARDEE>ALVAREZ & ASSOCIATES, LLC;8601 GEORGIA AVE STE 510;SILVER SPRING;MD;209103476
<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
     				Office of Acquisition Operations
       				Technology Acquisition Center
           			23 Christopher Way
          				Eatontown, NJ 07724
      		
2.  Description of Action: The proposed sole source action is for a firm-fixed-price contract for Imaging Business Machines, LLC (IBML) High Speed Scanners and related maintenance with Alvarez and Associates. 

3.  Description of Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is for the purchase of two IBML scanners that are currently installed and used by the Financial Services Center (FSC)  under a leasing agreement.  In addition, FSC requires 12 months of maintenance to ensure these items remain operational.  FSC provides financial services on a fee-for-service basis to VA and other government agencies (OGA).  The period of performance is 12 months from date of award for maintenance.  The total estimated value of the proposed action is            .  In order to provide services to their customers, FSC has the requirement to scan various types of hard copy documents, which include:
a.	Commercial Invoices:  FSC processes over 1.1 million commercial payments for VA annually.  250 thousand invoices are received in hard copy format and scanned at the FSC.  Of the 250 thousand, the majority of these invoices are for Veterans Health Administration and are related to ambulance services and utilities for VA medical centers (VAMC).  FSC will be unable to pay these invoices, which will directly impact ambulance services received by Veterans and potentially result in the disruption of utility services relied upon by VAMCs.  
b.	Camp Lejeune Family Medical Program: FSC scans over 12 thousand supporting documents in order to process over 2 thousand medical claims for the families of Veterans suffering from medical conditions associated with water contamination while stationed at Camp Lejeune.  FSC would be unable to fulfill these claims processing services provided to Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Chief Business Office (CBO), jeopardizing the fulfillment of Public Law 112-154, which entitles these family members to have their healthcare claims reimbursed by VA.
c.	Commercial Canceled Checks:  FSC receives 194 thousand hard copy documents from VA vendors and VHA staff in support of requests to trace payments issued to vendors.  FSC is able to research and cancel 271 thousand payments annually, which returns funding to the VA obligation and allows our VA customers to reissue payment to the vendor.  FSC would be unable to process payment cancelations, which would prevent VA organizations from reissuing payments to vendors that predominantly provide services in support of VHA and Veteran healthcare. 
d.	Medical Claims for OGAs: FSC receives 661 thousand hard copy documents in order to process 418 thousand medical claims for the Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement health Service's Corps and the Department of Health and Human Service Office of Refugee and Resettlement.  FSC would be unable to fulfil our agreements with these agencies and the healthcare providers providing care to refugees and detainees would not be paid for their services.  This would lead to a stoppage of medical care for refugees/detainees and lead to a negative public relations impact for VA.  In addition, FSC would lose $3.3 million in annual revenue by not being able to fulfil the terms of our service agreement with these departments. 
e.	Consolidated Patient Account Centers (CPAC) Records:  FSC receives 3.9 million historical documents from VHA CPACs each year (Veteran explanation of benefits, waivers, write-offs, probates, bankruptcy documents).  Per agreement with VHA CBO, FSC scans these documents, which enables CPAC staff to search electronic documents quickly and efficiently saving storage space and time.  CPAC staff would have to store documents physically and physically search for paper records if FSC is unable to provide this service.
                         
4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C.3304(a)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 entitled, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The proposed source for this action is Alvarez and Associates, 8601 Georgia Ave STE 510, Silver Spring, MD 20910.  VA previously entered into an Interagency Agreement with the Department of Interior (DOI) for the required services.  DOI awarded a contract to Alvarez and Associates on August 30, 2013 to lease the two scanners.  FSC scans over 5.1 million documents annually, which consists of over 88 different document types.  The current high speed scanners are integrated with the FSC's Optical Character Resolution software and FSC's electronic content management systems.  As paper documents come into the FSC, they are first scanned into one of the IBML high speed scanners.  Through the integration of Optical Character Recognition software and scanners, the images are converted from text to electronic searchable type.  The data is then ready to be stored in the Electronic Content Management systems for processing.  If FSC were to replace the existing high speed scanning equipment with different brand, model, or even identical model, approximately in installation, configuration, and labor costs would be incurred.  In addition, 30 days would be required to install and configure new scanners, which would cause FSC operations to cease for 30 days resulting in the unacceptable impact mentioned in section 3 above.  For market research purposes, the Government obtained a quote provided from      in the amount of        for the purchase, installation and maintenance of new scanners, The total cost to buy out the current lease from Alvarez including 12 months of maintenance is        .  Processing a sole-source procurement and buying out the current lease will yield approximately in savings when compared to the quote obtained from

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in section 8 of this justification.  Additionally, the proposed action will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website in accordance with FAR 5.201.  Any proposals that are received shall be evaluated.  

7.   Actions to Increase Competition:  This is a one time buy out of the current lease agreement.  In the future requirements for printer/scanners will be competed.

8.  Market Research: VA's technical experts conducted market research on August 3, 2015 for the procurement of two IBML High Speed Scanners.  The market research consisted of reviewing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement V, Governmentwide Acquisition Contract Provider look up tool, which yielded six IBML resellers.  However, IBML no longer sells the 4500 model scanner that is currently in use by FSC.  The current high speed scanners are integrated with the FSC's Optical Character Recognition software and FSC's electronic content management systems.  Buying out the current lease would be more advantageous to the Government, based on the reasonableness of the price to buy out the lease and the efficiencies that would be maintained with keeping the current equipment in place.  Further, based on the quote provided by another vendor, FSC would save approximately by buying out the currently leased scanners. 

9.  Other Facts:  None.

<AWDDATE>092915
<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to renew the NRC's "Federal Associate" membership with the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Forum, Inc. for a base period of one year and two option years. The Forum's objectives include: facilitating state and interstate compact implementation of the federal Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act; educating policy makers and the public about the management and disposal of low-level radioactive waste and about the aims of the federal legislation; fostering information sharing among state and interstate compact officials; providing opportunities for state and interstate compact officials to exchange views with federal officials and other interested parties; and supporting the goals of interstate compacts.
<p>The NRC has procured membership with the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Forum, Inc. for the last three years. The last purchase order issued for an annual membership was NRC-HQ-55-14-P-0003.</p>
<p>"Federal Associate" Membership to the Forum will include: (1) active non-voting participation in meetings of the Forum; (2) two sets of all written materials; (3) access for two individuals to the members-only portion of the Forum website; and (4) two non-voting representatives per meeting with no registration fee.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under FAR 13.106-1(b).</p>
<p>The Forum is a one-of-a-kind, independent, non-profit corporation dedicated to information sharing regarding low-level waste issues. Access to this information requires a membership.</p>
<p>There are no other comparable entities doing this type of work. NRC's participation is critical because it is the Federal agency that regulates the management of commercial low-level radioactive waste.</p>
<p>This requirement will posted on FBO but will not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, per FAR 5.202(a)(13)(i).</p>
<p>The CS compared the membership fee invoice provided by the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Forum, Inc. to the listed price on the company's website at http://www.llwforum.org/about.htm#9. The company also agreed to lock the annual rate for 3 years. The CS determined that the invoiced price provided by the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Forum, Inc. is the standard membership fee for all Federal employees, therefore determined to be fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>In the event of a recurring need for the acquisition of these services is required, the COR will inform the Contracting Officer in a timely manner so a Sources Sought Notice can be posted on FBO.</p>
<p>AMD will closely scrutinize future requests for renewal of the Standard Federal Associate Membership with the LLW Forum, Inc. and will ensure that any restrictions to competition are adequately supported and documented.</p>

FAR PART 8.405-6 
 
2237 Transaction # or Vista Equipment Transaction #: 553-16-1-3102-0011		  

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: Siemens Industry Inc	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  Nathaniel Brown (734-751-4639)	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 45470 Commerce Center Drive, Plymouth, MI 48170	
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: Nathaniel Brown (734-751-4639)	

X  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	John D. Dingell VA Medical Center
	                                                                                              Detroit, MI 48201___________
	     	
	     	
                                                                          VISN:	11	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
This is a request for a firm fixed price task order contract against GSA contract GS-07F-217CA for the annual testing and calibration of airflows in critical areas required by Joint Commission (as a non-competitive requirement). A base year plus four option years is being requested.	
     	
     	
     	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
Siemens will supply all air flow readings and calibrations to the required areas throughout the Detroit VA Medical Center.  They will update all required information in any module as required by the management system.  	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $359,600.00 (Base of $68,411.00 plus four additional option years)	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   10/01/2015	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

X	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
The contractor is the manufacturer of the automation system which requires their proprietary software and upgrades, which can only be supplied and installed by Siemens.  All readings to modules as well as hood controllers that must be entered into the automation system is proprietary and needs factory trained service technicians to adjust programming and make necessary changes.  Maintenance solutions are developed by the manufacturer to meet changing environments unique to the machinery 	
     	
     	
     	

X	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
___If any modules are found defective, they must be replaced with Siemens modules in order to operate on our network. _______________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
	
     	
     	
     	
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
In accordance with FAR 8.404(d), GSA/FSS has already determined the prices of supplies, fixed priced services, and rates for services offered at hourly rates, under schedule contracts, to be fair and reasonable.  Siemens has supported the system throughout the entire life of our network (15 years) with exceptional service and responds to our needs  as well as training to VA staff to make operation and repairs of the system a benefit to the Medical Center.  The system also requires proprietary information and support of which only Siemens can supply.   Due to the proprietary information, it is not possible at this time to obtain these services from other vendors.  If this requirement were to be competed, the entire system would need to be replaced, and these costs would not be recovered through competition.  This makes Siemens the best value to the government.  	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	



(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market research was not conducted because the system requires proprietary information and support of which only the manufacturer can supply.    	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None  	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
We will continuously survey the market to determine feasibility or a competitive procurement.  	
     	
     	
     	
     	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

The price is considered fair and reasonable based on established FSS pricing.  The service contract costs for this equipment have been negotiated and a FSS contract has been established for this work.  The FSS contract number is V797P-6011B.

In the future, we will complete the requirement for new equipment and the resulting service contracts will reflect this order.  We will also perform additional market research at the end of the fiscal year to see if there are any updates to the FSS contract.

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
FY15 Task order for Clinical Analyzer Cost Per Reportable Tests as required by PALMS.  Tests are required for direct patient care and are performed daily.  Siemens Clinical Anayzers are currently used by the John D. Dingell VAMC.	
     	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
$960,000, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics.  Cost per reportable test for Clinical Analyzers, 2 ea Siemens Advia 1800, and 2 ea Siemens Centaur XP, service includes all equipment, reagent, maintenance and supplies.  Period of performance 10/1/2014 to 9/30/2015.	
     	
     	
	
       (b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $960,000.00

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  

0	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.

     	


0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________
____________________________________________________________________________

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
The John D. Dingell VA Medical Center has four Siemens Clinical Analyzers installed.  These analyzers are validated and currently performing clinical patient care testing.  Any change to the currently  validated system would require new testing, training and validation of the new equipment which could take up to 8 months.  Keeping the current analyzers is the best option until the new consolidated VISN 11 Chemistry contract is completed, expected late FY 2016.



0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	




(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
$960,000.  Until the VISN 11 consolidated contract is in place, this represent the Best Value, because replacing the clinical analyzers would require 6 to 8 months of testing, validation and training of Clinical Staff at a higher cost the would not be recovered through competition.  This price is fair and reasonable based on historical pricing for this service, The Task Order for FY14 service, VA251-14-F-0560, showed the same pricing, $960,000.00.  In addition, the contract pricing for the Siemens VA NAC Contract, V797D-30175 is already considered fair and reasonable.	
     	

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: Laboratory Corporation of America   Contract #V797P-7041A	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  Debra Hoover 313-819-4510	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 1400 Donelson Pike, Suite B-10, Nashville, TN 37217

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	Department of Veterans Affairs	
	VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System_
		2215 Fuller Road__________________
	Ann Arbor, MI 48105	
	     	
                                                                          VISN:	11	

(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
LSJ for a firm-fixed price purchase order for reference laboratory testing.  	
     	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
Reference Laboratory testing for patients at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System from 10/1/2015 to 12/31/2015.	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $161,300 based on expected testing volume.	

	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   10/1/2015 to 12/31/2015	

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

1	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
Currently LabCorp has been performing these services via a VISN wide BPA for the last five years.  This three (3) month purchase order bridges the gap between the end of coverage for FY 15 and the start of the new VISN 11 BPA estimated to be awarded 1/1/2016, which is being competed among FSS contract holders. In order to change from LabCorp to another vendor, there are numerous tasks that will take considerable coordination.  Programming the new pathology lab codes, calibration, IT issues, and validation issues takes at least three months to successfully change vendors.  Utilizing the current reference lab testing vendor  best ensures continuity of care.  Conversion to a new reference lab for this bridge period would unduly complicate the tracking of patient results and cause the VA to be at significant risk for a patient incident.  Changing vendors would also would also require significant installation of equipment, testing, training of new employees and contractor background investigations which would take at least three months to complete.  Currently, Laborp has all the systems/courier/IT systems/staff in place and no other vendor could be operational by 10/1/2015.	
     	

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
     	

0	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
____________________________________________________________________________

0	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
     	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
$161,300 based on projected volume.  The price for the 3 months of additional patient testing services is fair and reasonable based on historical pricing, The vendor agreed to charge the same pricing as the expired VISN 11 BPA, V797-BP-0126, which is discounted from regular FSS pricing for V797-7041A by 2%. Changing to another contractor during this period woud cause the VA to pay current FSS pricing with no discounts.  This action represents the best value to the Government not only for cost, but also for non-


price considerations such as staff training, and associated costs with transitioning to a new vendor. Such as developing new pathology lab codes and computer protocols.	


(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
FSS and the internet were searched; only one FSS contract holder is able to provide required services by 10/1 and that is the incumbent, LabCorp.	


(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
New BPA expected to be awarded 1/1/2016. VISN 11 	
     	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
Should another requisition of this nature reoccur, we would undertake a new market survey. 	

(9)  REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge.  I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
Service contract from October 1, 2015 - September 30, 2016 to Siemens (1000 Deerfield Parkway, Buffalo Grove, IL 60089; 734-928-8560) to provide preventative maintenance, software upgrades and repairs and panel, equipment and computer upgrades to the Siemens Energy Management system installed at the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center, 2215 Fuller Road, Ann Arbor, MI 48105.  The Siemens system installed at the VAMC Ann Arbor consists of four (4) workstations, 38 modular building controllers, three (3) unitary controllers, one (1) digital point unit and 710 terminal equipment controllers.  This is against GSA contract GS-07F-217CA.  	
     	
     	
     	

	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $277,191.14

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

X	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
The existing building management system was installed by the OEM manufacturer, Siemens Industry, Inc.  The software used is proprietary to Siemens and the installed controllers will not function with another vendor's system.  Only Siemens is able to provide the service and programs the controllers installed at the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center.

X	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     (If FAR 8.405-6(a)(2)iii before posting.  Do not include specific proprietary data. Only mention the type of equipment, procedure, etc. to show that proprietary supplies or services are being procured.)	
The existing building management system was installed by the OEM manufacturer, Siemens Industry, Inc.  The software used is proprietary to Siemens and the installed controllers will not function with another vendor's system.  Only Siemens is able to provide service and programs the controllers have already installed.  

X	These are "direct replacements" parts/components for existing equipment.  
__The panel and computer upgrades are replacing existing older equipment that the vendor will no longer support due to the age of the equipment.

X	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
The new equipment must interface with the existing building management infrastructure already installed at the VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System, and the sensors, temperature monitors and other devices must work with Siemens software and hardware systems.  The existing building management system is built around Siemens proprietary system language.  In order to integrate into the existing system, any new equipment must have a controls sequence written in the same language.  

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
NA

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
NA

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
This procurement represents the best value to the government because upgrading the system through the OEM vendor, given the proprietary nature, is cheaper than competing this procurement which might result in replacing all the controllers and all the other Siemens equipment already installed at the Ann Arbor VA Medical Center.  The price is considered fair and reasonable based on established FSS pricing.

(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
FSS and the internet were searched.  GSA Schedule 246 01(Smart Building Systems Integrator), shows nine (9) vendors, Actron Security, Ameresco, American Development Institute, C&C Sales, Security & Energy Technologies Corporation, Siemens, Signet Technologies, Southland Industries, and System Development.  Only Siemens, the OEM vendor, is able to service an upgrade Siemens building monitoring equipment via an FSS contract.  

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
None	

(8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
Should another requisition of this nature reoccur, we would undertake a new market survey.

$159,000 based on projected volume.  The price for the 3 months of additional patient testing services is fair and reasonable based on historical pricing, The vendor agreed to charge the same pricing as the expired VISN 11 BPA, V797-BP-0126, which is discounted from regular FSS pricing for V797-7041A by 2%.

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)


1.	Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO12, Great Lakes Acquisition Center, Suite 101, Milwaukee, WI 53214-1476. Transaction 695-16-1-6134-0001, Jeron Nurse Call System Maintenance Services.


2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  This procurement is for preventative maintenance and repair of the Jeron Nurse Call System located at the Milwaukee VA Medical Center in accordance with FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items. This is a new requirement for a firm-fixed price base plus three option year contract.

3.	Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:  Repair, preventative maintenance and maintenance (emergency and non-emergency) of the Jeron Nurse Call System. Must be able to provide labor, parts and services needed to maintain the system. Vendor must be able to provide and install all software updates, upgrades and consumables. The total estimated cost of the contract is $480,000.00.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  
	( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1.
	
5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   The Milwaukee VA Medical Center needs to be able to provide software updates and upgrades to the existing system. No other vendors are able to access the proprietary system to allow for upgrades.
  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  Posted the statement of work with a request for information (VA69D-15-N-1247) on Federal Business Opportunities. The request was posted form 8/6/15 to 8/13/15 to identify vendors that could provide maintenance, preventative and emergency, labor, supplies and equipment to include travel and expenses for the care of the Jeron Nurse Call System located at the Milwaukee VA Medical Center. Upon closing, only the incumbent responded. 


7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Pricing has been compared to current contract VA69D-P-1475. Base pricing is the same for option year four of the current contract which was determined fair and reasonable by the Contracting Officer at time of award. The remaining option years one through three are priced at $115,000, $122,000 and $128,000 respectively, to reflect economic adjustment and increase in maintenance costs for aging equipment. The anticipated cost is considered fair and reasonable by the contracting officer for the base and three option years.






8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  A request for information with an attached statement of work was posted to Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) from 8/6/15 - 8/13/15. Upon closing, only one response was received; the incumbent did respond with their capabilities statement. Conducted a Small Dynamic Business Search which revealed two businesses, Vitel Communications and Systec Ltd. The incumbent, Systec provided their capabilities statement however; Vitel Communications only services the Texas pan handle area.  GSA Advantage revealed four vendors but these vendors only provided the nurse call systems and supplies and not services.  CVE Government-wide database and Ability-One revealed no results.


9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  The system was installed under a construction contract from the Great Lakes Acquisition Center. Since the installation, the system has been expanded due to patient care area renovations. It would not be cost effective to remove the entire system to include the renovations to install another system from a different vendor. Given this information, at this time a new statement of work will not be developed to procure a new system.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: The only source that expressed interest in the posting VA69D-15-N-1247 to FBO was the incumbent, Systec Ltd., of Wisconsin.


11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or overcome any Barriers to Competition before making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  The Acquisition Center will continue to monitor the marketplace for new opportunities. The software upgrades may be accessed by other technicians in the future to allow for competition. At this time it is more cost effective to put a longer contract in place. Market research dictated that only one source is still available and no others have come forward at this time. The option years will provide continued services for the veterans until such time as a new system can be put into place or another vendor is made available.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL 
FOR A LIMITED SOURCE AWARD UNDER A FEDERAL SUPPLY SCHEDULE

1.  Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
                                      Office of Acquisition Operations
      Strategic Acquisition Center (SAC)
      10300 Spotsylvania Avenue
      Fredericksburg, VA 22408

2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for a sole source three (3) month Firm Fixed Price (FFP) task order to cover services until the national Blanket Purchase Agreement is established for software and hardware maintenance services for the Innovian Anesthesia Record Keeper (ARK) System from Draeger Medical, Inc.  Innovian software and clinical work stations are in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Veterans Integrated System Networks (VISN) 7, at Atlanta, Birmingham, Dublin, Augusta, Columbia, Montgomery, and Charleston VAMC for ARK program mission within VHA. This effort is proposed to be awarded under the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) V797P-4081B to Draeger Medical, Inc., 3135 Quarry Road, Telford, Pennsylvania 18969.

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is to obtain software and hardware maintenance services for the Innovian ARK System. VHA has previously purchased and installed Innovian ARK perpetual software licenses and hardware from Draeger Medical, Inc. Innovian Anesthesia software is a robust ARK System with an Innovian-end Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) interface that enables real time bi-directional exchanges of data in VistA both in batch and real time. VISN 7 uses Innovian Anethesia software for electronic documentation in anesthesiology environments. The software provides users important data, such as patient demographics, text integration, patient allergies, problem lists, care status and delivery, lab results, medication administration, and information regarding surgeries. The ARK replaces paper anesthesia records used in the Operating Rooms (ORs) and other anesthetizing or moderate sedation locations to manage patient information in the OR, pre and post-procedural, and critical information during OR procedures. 

The software maintenance include software updates, and new versions; including, any replacement versions or name revisions of the existing perpetual unlimited, non-exclusive software licenses. The hardware maintenance includes scheduled repairs, unscheduled maintenance, preventative maintenance, technical support, and training. The current contract is set to expire September 30, 2015. 

The Period of Performance will be October 1, 2015-December 31, 2015. The estimated price of the proposed action is inclusive of the 3 month ordering period is $97,500.

4.  Authority:  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B), Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized.

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The proposed source for this effort is Draeger Medical, Inc., 3135 Quarry Road, Telford, Pennsylvania 18969. The Innovian Anesthesia software and hardware, produced and developed by Draeger Medical is a proprietary product. Draeger Medical, Inc. is the manufacturer of both Innovian Anesthesia and Draeger Clinical work stations and does not authorize third parties to perform maintenance or repairs. Without Draeger Medical, Inc. support services, VHA will ultimately experience application performance problems within Innovian and across multiple data systems, which will ultimately limit user access to critical patient care information and loss of patient data. Only Draeger Medical, Inc. support services will ensure the existing Innovian Anesthesia software and hardware operates continuously and ensures VA clinical and technical experts can obtain the necessary technical support to resolve any issues related to use of the Innovian Anesthesia product. Changing software systems would require new ARK systems. Additionally, any other source would require access to Draeger Medical proprietary data in order to successfully perform support services for the Innovian Anesthesia software and hardware. This data is not available to the Government and only Draeger Medical, Inc. owns it.

6. Determination of Best Value: I hereby determine that the proposed contract action will represent the best value to the Government.  GSA has already determined that the prices on the FSS contract are fair and reasonable.  
Additionally, price discounts will be sought when negotiating the final agreement.
  
7. Market Research: On March 10, 2015, a sources sought notice was posted on Federal Business Opportunities, Request for Information (RFI) VA 119-15-N-0150.  The goal was to identify sources to provide Innovian ARK software and hardware maintenance support.  Only Draeger Medical, Inc. responded to the RFI.  This market research confirmed that Draeger Medical, Inc. is the only source with the required expertise to provide maintenance support for the Innovian ARK software and hardware.  In addition, there are no comparable sources able to perform or provide the Innovian ARK software and hardware maintenance support.  

Draeger Medical, Inc. stated they are the only organization authorized to provide support to the Innovian ARK software product.  This makes them the only suitable and capable company to provide this maintenance.  Draeger Medical, Inc. is the sole developer of the Innovian ARK software and the sole proprietor of the Innovian ARK software, having created the product.  Draeger Medical, Inc. is the only company that has access to the software code and is the only provider of ongoing support for this software.  No other company has the rights or expertise to perform the same services.  Since the original release of Innovian software version 1.0 in 2004, Draeger Medical, Inc. created and released many versions, including the latest release of 6.0, which contains many VA-specific requirements.  Draeger Medical, Inc. maintains a factory trained staff of technical support engineers.  Draeger Medical, Inc. continually releases new versions of Innovian software and migrated VA customers forward to these new versions. The next scheduled release is version 6.1, which is anticipated to be installed in all 44 VA sites currently under contract with Draeger Medical, Inc. for their ARK system. 

The maintenance services are commercially available.  In addition to support services currently provided to Federal Government sites, Draeger Medical, Inc. is also the exclusive provider of such services to approximately 39 commercial sites that use Innovian software. Draeger Medical, Inc. stated they are the only organization authorized to provide support to the Innovian software product, making them the only suitable and capable company to provide this maintenance.  

8. Any other facts supporting the justification: The Innovian Anesthesia software and hardware, produced and developed by Draeger Medical is a proprietary product. Draeger Medical does not have affiliation or agreements in place with any authorized resellers to resolve technical problems and/or obtain Draeger Medical, Inc. software updates; therefore, Draeger Medical is the only one responsible source that exists to obtain this vital support.

9. Actions to Increase Competition: In order to remove or overcome barriers to competition in future acquisitions for this requirement, the agency will work with the program office to perform additional market research to consider if alternate support service providers become available.  

10. Efforts to Obtain Competition: Market research was conducted, details of which are in the market research section of this document. This effort did not yield any additional sources that can meet the Government's requirements. There is no competition anticipated for this acquisition. In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 8.405-6(a)(2), this action will be synopsized at award on the Federal Business Opportunities Page (FBO) and the justification will be made publicly available. 

11. Technical and Requirements Certification:  I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in this justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.

None




	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$33,799.68 (base year and 3 option years)

2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

This is a request for other than full and open competition for the procurement of a service maintenance agreement for two Med Rad Angiojet systems located at the Buffalo VA Medical Center to include: Unlimited Service Repair Visits; 1 Preventative Maintenance per Year; 100% Coverage on Replacement Parts;100% Coverage on Labor and Travel Expenses; Software Updates; 24 x7 Phone Support.

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Boston Scientific  LLC is the only company that provides firm fixed price service maintenance plans for the two Med Rad Angiojet systems located at the Buffalo VA Medical Center.


4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Market research has indicated that there are no companies that are authorized to service the Med Rad Angiojet systems other than Boston Scientific as a result of patents and copyrights associated with this piece of equipment..
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
A search conducted on GSA eBUY and CCST using the key word "Angiojet" did not identify any GSA contracts that could meet the calibration and service maintenance agreement requirement.
A search on the Vetbiz database using NAICs code "811219" and keyword "Angiojet" identified 0 potential veteran owned businesses that could possibly meet the requirement.

A sources sought notice (VA528-15-N-0362) was posted on FBO from 08/31/2015 to 09/11/2015 and received no written responses.
With no relevant SDVOSBs nor VOSBs found on the VetBiz website, a search was conducted for all Small Businesses registered with the SBA under NAICS code 811219 using Key word "Angiojet" in the continental US (including 8(a) and HUBZONE. This search identified that there were no companies registered that meet the requirement.

With no required or established sources, nor any SDVOSB, VOSB, or small businesses found, it is determined that this requirement for a service maintenance agreement for Med Rad Angiojet systems can only be met by large businesses.
A Google search for "Med Rad Angiojet system servicing" did not result in the identification of any companies other than Boston Scientific LLC that could possibly meet the requirements of this procurement.
The previous procurement for this requirement, VA528-P-0962, was procured as a sole source to Bayer Healthcare LLC. Bayer Healthcare LLC has since sold this product line to Boston scientific and no longer services this product line.


6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

	(X  )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;

	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;


5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   

The establishment of a preventative maintenance contract for the copper silver ionization system is necessary to manage the pathogenic biological agents in the domestic hot water system at these three medical centers. This is in accordance with Joint Commision E.G. 1.7 requirements along with VIIA Directive 1061. 

The existing Copper Silver Ionization systems at these facilities has been designed, built and installed by Liquitech Inc. Liquitech is the only responsible source for services of this equipment since their design is proprietary. There are no other qualified vendors that are authorized to service these ionization systems and can obtain new Liquitech replacement parts to ensure that the ionization systems are operating in compliance with the above mentioned Joint Commission requirement and VIIA Directive. All the required laboratory validation of copper and silver levels must be tested and evaluated through Liquitech in order to make adjustments to the cells and control system to maintain proper ion levels. 

6.	Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  A search conducted on GSA eBUY using the key word "liquitech" did not identify any GSA contracts that could meet the calibration and service maintenance agreement requirement. A search on the Vetbiz database using NAICs code "561790" and keyword "liquitech" identified 0 potential veteran owned businesses that could possibly meet the requirement. A Google search for "Liquitech copper silver ionization system servicing" did not result in the identification of any companies that could possibly meet the requirements of this procurement.
A sources sought notice (VA528-15-N-0294) was posted on FBO from 07/20/2015 to 08/03/2015 and received two written responses from All Environmental Compliance Inc and National Facilities Solutions LLC. After conversations with both companies over the phone, neither of these two companies are authorized by Liquitech to service the ionization system, nor did they have access to new liquitech replacement parts.
The previous procurement for this requirement under two separate contracts, VA528-13-C-0011 and VA528-13-C-0091, both as sole source procurements awarded to Liquitech Inc.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable: The pricing of this contract has been compared to the price of the previous procurement of these services with the Liquitech Inc. (VA528-13-C-0011, PO# 528C52040 and 528C50043 from 10/01/2013 to 09/30/2015 and VA528-13-C-0091, PO 528C50140 from 10/01/2013 to 09/30/2015). The annual price for services rendered to the Canandaigua VAMC and Buffalo VAMC under contract VA528-13-C-0011 was $19,362.00 and $32,000.00 respectively. The annual price for services rendered to the Batavia VAMC under contract VA528-13-C-0091was $20,000.00. The annual price for the same services for the Buffalo and Batavia VAMCs has not increased in the quote provided for this procurement. The annual price quote for the Canandaigua facility has increased by $6,116.00 from $19,362.00 to $25,478.00. A review of the previous contract and the current quote that the scope of work has increased from the previous contract from coverage of buildings 3 and 7 to coverage of buildings 3, 7, 8 and 9. The $6,116.00 increase in price can be attributed to the addition of buildings 8 and 9 to the scope of work. As a result of the annual pricing for the Buffalo and Batavia VAMCs remaining the same and the pricing for the Canandaigua VAMC only increasing due to an increase in scope, the pricing is therefore considered fair and reasonable.
