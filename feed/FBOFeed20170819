<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.
<p>No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334519 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. <br />AFRL/RITE requires the purchase of one (1) real-time Evapotranspiration Extension and one (1) Signal Processing Unit (SPU) Set for the BLS Series scintillometer from Scintec Corporation.</p>
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract for the purchase of the items described above with: Scintec Corporation, 197 South 104th Street, Louisville, Colorado 80027.</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this requirement. Scintec Corporation is the only know manufacturer of an Evapotranspiration Extension and Signal Processing Unit that are compatible and interoperable with AFRL's previously-purchased Scintec BLS900 scintillometer. Past data has been collected and documented at the Government's unique test sites. In order to be consistent with past data results and to maintain compatibility with existing hardware and data analysis systems, the required Evapotranspiration Extension and SPU must be compatible with the original BLS900 Scintillometer to ensure consistency and continuity in experimentation. Scintec Corporation's Evapotranspiration Extension and SPU are integral to the existing optical link demonstration at AFRL/RI. These products offer the best performance for long range free space optical turbulence and Real-Time Evapotranspiration measurements. This performance is needed to provide good correlation to AFRL/RITE 30 Km path test link. Scintec is the only source of products which provide the additional capabilities of the Evapotranspiration Extension and the SPU while maintaining compatibility with existing equipment. Use of another manufacturers products would cause AFRL to experience a duplication of costs not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and NOT a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to leslie.christoferson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.<br />Responses received will be evaluated; however a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The Government anticipates an award date on or before 27 September 2017.</p>
<p><br />A Sole Source Justification will be attached to the subsequent Notice of Award.</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Proposed Contract Action under the FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice is for information only; a solicitation will not be issued. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516 with a small business size standard of 1000 employees. <br />AFRL/RIGB requires a purchase of four (4), SI-9486 PCM Demodulator and Decoder.
<p>The Government intends to negotiate a sole source contract with:</p>
<p>DRS Signal Solutions<br />1 Milestone Center Court<br />Germantown MD 20876<br />301-944-8295; POC: Paul Dell</p>
<p>The Government has determined that no other source can meet this Software-Defined (SD) Card Set that uses Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology and provides a real-time, wideband, signal processing in a half-length, single-slot Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) Card Set as the SI-9486 PCM Demodulator and Decoder can. The SI-9486 PCM Demodulator and Decoder processes a variety of narrow- to high-bandwidth signal formats and provides soft decision data to the decoder. The decoder removes transmission formatting including framing, interleaving, and scrambling and executes block and convolution decoding algorithms to extract the transmitted data. The data is provided over the PCIe bus allowing the user to record or to perform additional processing using host computer resources. Software executables define the demodulator and decoder algorithms, enabling the unit to be upgraded in the field with a software download. The SI-9486 PCM Demodulator and Decoder is controlled using a board-level C programming language driver. DRS Signal Solutions is the only company that can provide the four (4) SI-9486 PCM Demodulator and Decoders that have the capabilities to maintain compatibility with existing system hardware and software baselines without any issues with the required platform. Use of another manufacturers products would cause AFRL to experience a duplication of costs not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This is a notice of proposed contract action and not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. All inquiries should be sent by email to jennifer.calandra-willson@us.af.mil. Responses must be submitted by the date/time listed on the notice.

<DESC>This contract action is for the acquisition of supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1). The National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), Office of Acquisitions (OA) intends to award a single source purchase order to Innovive, LLC, 10019 Waples Court, San Diego, CA 92121-2962, for the acquisition of Innorack Ventilated Racks.
<p><br />1. MS35-8-10-80N- V3.5 Innorack 8 Wide, 10 High, 80 Cages, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with 2 Blowers, Power Supply, Trolley, and Digital Controller-<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Single Sided Mouse,(3 each)</p>
<p>2. V3.5 HVAC Kit, Stainless Steel-Single Sided Rack,(3 each)</p>
<p>3. Fuse Kit,(3 each)</p>
<p>4. Crate for Innovive Rack,(2 each)</p>
<p>5. Shipping&nbsp; <br /><br />The Innovive racks will be used to support the 100% PET single used disposable Innocage mouse caging system currently in house for chemical studies. The Conventional Animal Facility (CAF) is designed to house animals that are not able to be housed in the main building at the NIEHS, Animal Facility due to health issues. The design of the CAF does not include a cage washing facility, thus there is the requirement for compact storage and disposable/recyclable animal caging. Equipment is not allowed to enter the main facility once exposed to the Conventional Animal Facility so that there is no risk of contamination to the animals housed in the main facility.</p>
<p>The Innovive ventilated racks are the only racks compatible with current disposable caging and supplies in the Animal Facility. For on-going research projects, compatibility with existing equipment is required to prevent in-house research animals from being at risk. The Innovive ventilated racks are thus required to meet the specifications for this requirement.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 339999 "All Other Miscellaneous Manufacturing" and a Size Standard of 500.</p>
<p>The anticipated delivery time is 8 Weeks, ARO.</p>
<p>NIEHS will solicit and negotiate directly with Innovive, LLC, and no solicitation will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotations; however, all responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Offerors must have an active registration in the System for Award Management (SAM) www.sam.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties must express their interest and must be submitted in writing via email to Valarie K. Sims at valare.sims@nih.gov and are due by 9:00 AM, August 22, 2017. No faxed documents will be accepted. If no responsive statements are received by the due date, an award will be made to Innovive, LLC.</p>

<p>The Lockport Prairie restoration project is located within the City of Lockport, Will County, IL along the Des Plaines River and the adjacent upland bluff. Restoration activities will consist of Invasive species control, restoration of site to natural conditions, tree removal and disablement of drain tile. The project area consists of two adjacent preserves, Lockport Prairie Nature Preserve and Prairie Bluff Preserve. Lockport Prairie contains large areas of globally rare dolomite prairie and serves as critical habitat for the Hines Emerald Dragonfly. Prairie Bluff Preserve helps provide groundwater to Lockport Prairie that is critical for maintaining Hines Emerald Dragonfly habitat. The Hines Emerald Dragonfly is an endangered species.</p>
<p>The project includes the restoration of over 400 acres of native habitats and the removal of invasive species in both Lockport Prairie and Prairie Bluff Preserve. Treatment of invasive species by both mechanical removal and herbicide application will take place. Native communities will be planted using both commercial plant and seed as well as by propagating plant material from on site to preserve local genetics. Portions of the site will undergo hydrologic restoration to improve critical groundwater flows. In whole, this work will greatly improve habitat for the Hines Emerald Dragonfly, as well as other critical species in and around the Des Plaines River Valley.</p>

<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. As used in this provision -</p>
<p>Scientific activities mean activities that involve inventorying, monitoring, observations, experimentation, study, research, integration, modeling, and scientific assessment.</p>
<p>Scientific integrity means the condition resulting from adherence to professional values and practices when conducting and applying the results of science that ensures objectivity, clarity, and reproducibility, and that provides insulation from bias, fabrication, falsification, plagiarism, interference, censorship, and inadequate procedural and information security.</p>
<p>Presentation of scientific activities results includes the analysis, synthesis, compilation, or translation of scientific information and data into formats for the use of the Department of Commerce or the United States of America.</p>
<p>Scientific and Research Misconduct means fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in proposing, performing, or reviewing scientific and research activities, or in the products or reporting of the results of these activities. It specifically includes intentional circumvention of the integrity of the scientific and research process and actions that compromise that process, but does not include honest error or differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Investigation is formal collection and evaluation of information and facts to determine if scientific or research misconduct can be established, to assess its extent and consequences, and to recommend appropriate action.</p>
<p>(b) General Guidelines</p>
<p>1. Maintaining Integrity. The Contractor shall maintain the scientific integrity of research performed pursuant to this contract award including the prevention, detection, and remediation of research misconduct, and the conduct of inquiries, investigations and adjudications of allegations of research misconduct.</p>
<p>2. In performing or presenting the results of scientific activities under the contract, and in responding to allegations of scientific and research misconduct, the Contractor shall comply with the provisions herein and NOAA Administrative Order (NAO) 202-735D, Scientific Integrity, and its Procedural Handbook, including any amendments thereto. That Order can be found at:<br />http://www.corporateservices.noaa.gov/ames/administrative_orders/chapter_202/202-735-D.html</p>
<p>3. Primary Responsibility. The Contractor shall have the primary responsibility to prevent, detect, and investigate allegations of scientific and research misconduct. Unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall promptly conduct an initial inquiry into any allegation of such misconduct and may rely on its internal policies and procedures, as appropriate, to do so.</p>
<p>4. By executing this contract, the Contractor provides its assurance that it has established an administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigating, and reporting allegations of scientific and research misconduct; and that it will comply with its own administrative process for performing an inquiry, investigation and reporting of such misconduct.</p>
<p>5. The Contractor shall insert the substance of this provision in subcontracts at all tiers that involve research being performed under this contract.</p>
<p>(c) Investigating Misconduct Research</p>
<p>1. Initiating Investigation. If the Contractor determines that there is sufficient evidence to proceed to an investigation, it shall notify the Contracting Officer and, unless otherwise instructed, the Contractor shall:</p>
<p>a. Promptly conduct an investigation to develop a complete factual record and an examination of such record leading to either a finding of scientific and research misconduct and an identification of appropriate remedies or a determination that no further action is warranted.</p>
<p>b. If the investigation leads to a finding of scientific and research misconduct, obtain adjudication by a neutral third party adjudicator. The adjudication must include a review of the investigative record and, as warranted, a determination of appropriate corrective actions and sanctions.</p>
<p>2. Finalizing Investigation. When the investigation is complete, the Contractor shall forward to the Contracting Officer a copy of the evidentiary record, the investigative report, any recommendations made to the Contractor's adjudicating official, the adjudicating official's decision and notification of any corrective action taken or planned, and the subject's written response (if any).</p>
<p>(d) Findings and Corrective Actions</p>
<p>1. If the Contractor finds that scientific and research misconduct has occurred, it shall assess the seriousness of the misconduct and its impact on the research completed or in process and shall:</p>
<p>a. Take all necessary corrective actions, which includes, but are not limited to, correcting the research record, and, as appropriate, imposing restrictions, controls, or other parameters on research in process or to be conducted in the future, and</p>
<p>b. Coordinate remedial action with the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(e) Department of Commerce Actions</p>
<p>1. The Department of Commerce may accept the Contractor's findings or proceed with its own investigation, in which case the Contractor shall fully cooperate with the investigation. The Contracting Officer will inform the Contractor of the Department's final determination.</p>
<p>2. The Department of Commerce reserves the right to pursue such remedies and other actions as it deems appropriate, consistent with the terms and conditions of the contract and applicable laws and regulations. Such remedies and actions may include, but are not limited to, disallowance of costs, recoupment of contract payments, and suspension or debarment.</p>
<p>OBUDSMANS CLAUSE<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A-76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e. After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f. The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g. Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.</p>
<p>(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p><br />(XIV) Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS) and assigned rating does not apply.</p>
<p><br />(XV) Quotes are required to be received in the contracting office no later than 4:00 P.M. MDT on August 10, 2017. All quotes must be faxed or emailed to the attention of Diana Romero. The E-mail address is Diana.Romero@noaa.gov and the fax number is (303) 497-3163.</p>
<p>(XVI) Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Diana Romero, (303) 497-3761, E-email address is diana.romero@noaa.gov .</p>

<br />Background Statement/Project History
<p>Purpose of Contract</p>
<p>The purpose of this contract is to provide support for technical assistance to CCDF grantees in order to improve their child care delivery system for low-income families. This contract is for the provision of communications and technological support for technical assistance provided by the OCC. The contract also provides logistical and conference management support for national and regional child care technical assistance activities sponsored by the OCC. The contract also promotes federal leadership and supports partnerships to facilitate the provision of technical assistance furthering accessible, affordable, high quality child care for low income, working families.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Office of Child Care (OCC) falls within the Office of Early Childhood Development (ECD), in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). ACF has responsibility for many programs that support the economic success of families and the well-being of children, including: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Head Start, Child Welfare, Child Support Enforcement, and the Social Services Block Grant.</p>
<p>The OCC supports low-income working families through child care financial assistance and promotes children's learning by improving the quality of early care and education and after-school programs. The OCC is responsible for administering the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) - a program that helps low-income families access child care for children while parents work or participate in education or training. A portion of CCDF also is used to improve the quality of child care. In FY 2017, the OCC awarded over $5 billion in CCDF funds to States, Territories, and Indian Tribes through block grants.</p>
<p>Each State, Territory or Tribe appoints a Lead Agency to administer the CCDF funds. These Lead Agencies make decisions about CCDF priorities, policies, and expenditures, including: determining eligibility requirements, setting family co-payment levels, establishing provider payment rates, setting target populations, and prioritizing quality investments. States, Territories and Tribes are required to complete a comprehensive planning process every three years, and to provide information on child care policies to ACF in triennial CCDF Plans.</p>
<p>The majority of CCDF monies are used to subsidize the cost of care for low-income families. States have options including contracting with community providers, blending funds with Head Start and public preschool programs to purchase spaces for eligible children, or providing certificates or vouchers that families can use to pay the provider of their choice. In addition, States are required to meet a 7% quality spending requirement and 3% infant and toddler quality spending requirement for FY 2017, further supporting State efforts to improve child care access and quality.</p>
<p>ECD has established an Early Childhood Training and Technical Assistance System (ECTTAS) to support the work of States, Territories, and Tribes that administer the CCDF, as well as local Head Start programs. In FY 2017, OCC-supported ECTTAS projects include:</p>
<p>&bull; The National Center on Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships supports effective implementation of the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnerships, which allows grantees to deliver high quality comprehensive services to low-income infants, toddlers and their families.<br />&bull; The National Center on Early Childhood Health and Wellness advances best practices for linking health and early childhood education systems.<br />&bull; The National Center on Parent, Family and Community Engagement supports family well-being, effective family and community engagement, and children's school readiness, including transitions to kindergarten. <br />&bull; The National Center on Early Childhood Development, Teaching and Learning advances best practices in the identification, development, and promotion of the implementation of evidence-based child development, teaching and learning practices that are culturally and linguistically responsive and lead to positive child outcomes. <br />&bull; The National Center on Early Childhood Quality Assurance supports the implementation of rigorous health, safety and licensing standards and promotes best practices that support the infrastructure of an ECE quality improvement framework. <br />&bull; The National Center on Afterschool and Summer Enrichment supports school-age care and summer learning programs by working with state-wide school-age networks and other community partners to expand learning opportunities for school-age children; identifying and promoting family engagement approaches; and coordinating with early childhood and school-age stakeholder groups and other federal programs to maximize effective service delivery models and minimize duplication of efforts. <br />&bull; The National Center on Child Care Subsidy Innovation and Accountability assists grantees in developing child-focused, family-friendly child care subsidy systems that are fair to providers, including implementing new provisions of newly reauthorized Child Care and Development Block Grant, reaching goals related to subsidy eligibility, integrating quality and subsidy, as well as strengthening program integrity, payment rules, rate setting, and other policies and practices that support serving more low-income children in high quality care. <br />&bull; The National Center on Tribal Early Childhood Development assists American Indian and Alaskan Native Tribes and tribal organizations in their efforts to implement and administer Child Care and Development Fund as well as increase the quality, affordability, and availability of child care.<br />&bull; The Child Care State Capacity Building Center (SCBC) supports child care administrators and their key partners to create early childhood systems that are coordinated, collaborative, and comprehensive in their approach to improving child outcomes and school readiness.</p>
<p>The Child Care Communications Management Center will work with OCC and the rest of ECTTAS to provide technical assistance to States and Territories as they build and strengthen high quality child care systems throughout the country.</p>
<p><br />Scope and Requirements</p>
<p>As part of ECD's ECTTAS, the Child Care Communications Management Center will support technical assistance and informational products to further the goals of CCDF grantees, the Office of Child Care, the Office of Early Childhood Development, and the Administration for Children and Families.</p>
<p>The scope of work for this project is:</p>
<p>Assistance in coordinating communication with CCDF grantees - The Contractor will work with OCC to maintain databases for relevant contacts. Further, the contractor will coordinate conference calls and webinars as needed to deliver technical assistance to grantees throughout the country. The Contractor will also, as requested by the COR, work with the OCC to develop communications and publications in order to better articulate our message and further our relationships with grantees and other partners.</p>
<p>Conference and meeting support - The Contractor will coordinate the logistics for both national and regionally-based technical assistance events in collaboration with OCC staff, the COR, and other ECTTAS partners as appropriate. The coordination will include acquiring meeting space; coordination and payment for travel and lodging costs of supported attendees; distribution of meeting invites, agendas, and any relevant follow-up materials; and audio visual support as needed. The contractor will pay special attention to abiding by all federal rules and regulations related to conferences and meetings.</p>
<p>Coordination and consultation with ECTTAS and other OCC partners - The Contractor will be responsible for coordinating with other ECTTAS partners as appropriate for meeting and event planning.</p>
<p>General Requirements:<br />a. The Contractor shall involve ECD and OCC staff in the various stages of development and implementation of this technical assistance effort, including updating and gathering information, per established protocols.<br />b. Any effort to contact multiple Lead Agencies in a systematic fashion will be approved in advance by the COR and the Contractor shall work with the COR to have any information collection activities approved by the Office of Management and Budget, if necessary.<br />c. As part of any training, technical assistance, or other presentation funded by the contract, the Contractor shall acknowledge verbally and in writing (on any presentation materials) that the Child Care Communications Management Center is a service of the OCC. All materials produced under this task order, including the project website, should include the OCC icon, HHS logo and names, and dates developed/updated.<br />d. The Contractor shall identify, as they occur, any potential problem areas in accomplishing the tasks and subtasks specified in the Scope of Work and recommend solutions to the COR.<br />e. The Contractor's satisfactory performance will be based on the Contractor's compliance with the project work plan, monthly and quarterly reports, quality and timeliness of products, feedback from CCDF grantees and ECD and OCC staff on technical assistance, and feedback from COR.<br />f. The Government has the right to refuse any subcontractor deviation from the Contractor's proposal.<br />g. The Contractor's staff shall have knowledge of early childhood and school age issues as they relate to CCDF. <br />h. The Contractor will maintain an office in the Washington D.C. area and locate an on-site Technical Assistance Support Coordinator at the Office of Child Care physical office (currently 330 C St., SW, Washington DC) an average of three days per week. The TA Support Coordinator shall serve as an on-site coordinator for technical assistance delivered directly from the ECD CSTTA Division to CCDF grantees, as well manage the logistics and any necessary technology for any technical assistance events or meetings held in federal space in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. He or she shall support OCC partnership-building and facilitate communication between OCC and its grantees and stakeholders. <br />i. The Contractor must conduct work under the contract in compliance with applicable Federal regulations (e.g., travel and meeting planning).</p>

QUESTION:Â  Can we utilize the elevators at GG136 and GG 137? 

RESPONSE:

Elevator GG136 and GG137 is available for the use of transporting people and equipment only. Transporting of dirt and spoils is prohibited.
The Contractor must not over load the elevators as weight limitations of the elevator must be taken into account for transporting equipment.
