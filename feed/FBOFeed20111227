<DESC>This project involves the construction of habitat improvement features over approximately 1/2 mile of Newsome Creek and reconstruction of Hayfork sediment pond. The activities will mitigate the environmental impacts of past dredge and placer mining. The work includes the construction of in-stream habitat structures and floodplain along with associated dredge pile relocation, earthwork and revegetation. Work at the sediment trap includes removal of existing features and construction of a new spillway. Revegetation of the disturbed sites will consist of erosion control seeding and on-site transplants only.
<p>The project is located on the Red River Ranger District, Nez Perce National Forest, Idaho County, Idaho. To reach the project site, travel approximately 40 miles east of Grangeville via State Highway 14 to the junction with Newsome Creek Road (Forest Service Road 1858). Proceed up Newsome Creek Road, past the old Newsome Townsite, approximately 7 miles to a gated access road that takes off sharply uphill and to the right. This road can be identified by the large boulders that have been placed by the gate. A similar road takes off just prior to this access road but no boulders are present. Motorized access to the project site is not allowed outside the construction window. The project site is located approximately 1 &frac12; miles from the gate. A formal pre-bid tour is not planned but a powerpoint with site photos has been provided and detailed specifications for the sediment trap reconstruction will be included with the solicitation.&nbsp; Interested parties may request&nbsp;a hardcopy of the powerpoint photos if&nbsp;computer difficulties are encountered.&nbsp;<br /><br />The estimated price range for the project is between $100,000-$250,000. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued between February and March of 2012 with implementation planned for the Summer/Fall of 2012. Snow, high water, and saturated ground conditions typically restrict equipment access until early July. This project constitutes Phase II of a three-phase project and will complete work in the middle stream reach to be treated. Phase I, located upstream from the current project area, was completed in 2011 and Phase III is planned for implemention in the 2013/2014 field seasons.</p>
<p>This solicitation has been set-aside for HUBZone Concerns. Offerors must be certified HUBZone Concerns with the U.S. Small Business Administration to be eligible for consideration. For information regarding the on-line application process, go to the following website at https: //eweb1.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/. This process can take 120 days or more to complete.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address<br /></strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 6120 Executive Boulevard, EPS Suite 600, Room 6068, Rockville, MD 20852, UNITED STATES.<br /><br /><strong>Description<br /></strong>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR) plans to procure on a sole source basis Tecan US, Inc 4022 Stirrup Creek Drive, Suite 301 Durham, NC 27703 for the brand name Attana Cell A200 temperature controlled, continuous-flow system.<br /><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1(b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions.<br /><br />It has been determined that there is no opportunity to acquire green products or services under this procurement.<br /><br />Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.<br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />Delivery Date: 60 days from date of award<br /><br />The Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch is dedicated to coordinated efforts in basic, preclinical and clinical investigations in the areas of immunology, tumor angiogenesis, hematopoiesis, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The goal is to generate information from basic and preclinical investigations leading to the development of new, curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant-based therapies for cancer. Information from new treatment protocols (including novel endpoints generated in the course of basic/preclinical research) is used to generate new questions and studies in the basic and preclinical research efforts. <br /><br />NCI requires a Attana Cell A200 to enable investigations on binding kinetics and molecular interactions between various ligands (e.g. antibodies, cytokines) to cell surface receptors on target cells (e.g. cancer cells, effector cells from transplant donors). These constitute a novel approach to study the biology of these molecular interactions. The Attana Cell A200 biosensor is based on quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technology and has the unique ability to detect and study molecular interactions not only in solution phase but also on cell surface. The newly designed sensor chip enables cultivation of cells on the sensor surface and measurement of the interaction in a simple fashion. This feature is particularly important for NCI's proposed investigations. It allows performing both biochemical and cellular assays, and a variety of cellular targets including adherent cells, suspension cells, fixed and non-fixed cells, primary cells and cell lines that we plan to use. The dual channel, temperature controlled and continuous flow system allows head to head comparison of interactions between a variety of molecules including proteins and carbohydrates, and obtain biologically relevant information about the early events in such interactions beyond affinity determinations. The system has the unique abilities to perform a number of applications including kinetics on cells, macromolecules, viruses, bacteria, concentration determination, competition assay and epitope mapping. Thus the system has capabilities that specifically meet the needs of NCI's current investigations and would facilitate additional future research applications.<br /><br />The Attana Cell A200 system uses improved quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) technology and allows determination of binding interactions that occur not only in solution phase, but more importantly, allows studying biomolecular interactions that occur on cell surface by growing target cells directly on the surface of the sensor chip. Thus it allows understanding of the molecular interactions in a biologically relevant microenvironment. This unique feature is an absolute requirement for the proposed investigations.<br /><br />This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations. However, if any interested party believes they can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities. All information furnished must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein. An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI Office of Acquisitions on or before 11:00 AM EST on January 5, 2012. No electronic capability statements will be accepted (i.e. email or fax), an original and one copy must be sent to the NCI Office of Acquisitions at the address stated above.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The National Park Service is conducting a MARKET SURVEY to determine the interest and capability of vendors for an upcoming project.  All costs associated with providing information as requested by this notice shall be the responsibility of the firm.  Any information submitted is voluntary.  The Contracting Officer will make an acquisition strategy decision based on the results of this market survey and a future solicitation may be issued as unrestricted without further consideration.   This is not an invitation for bid (IFB) or request for proposal (RFP) and does not constitute any commitment by the Government to issue any solicitation.  All interested firms must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this market survey.   Any solicitation that may be issued will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov).   The associated NAICS Code is 424710.
Project Description:   The National Park Service requires various petroleum products delivered to parks located in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Nebraska.  Our goal is to establish one or more firm fixed price, multi-year contracts with vendor(s) for these requirements.  We encourage your participation if you can provide the products to any of the locations listed.
Resulting contracts will include the Economic Price Adjustment clause (FAR 52.216-2).  The clause is summarized here.  The full text of the clause can be found at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/.  The Economic Price Adjustment clause states that the contractor guarantees their price will not exceed the established market price.  If the price increases, the contractor must submit notice to the Contracting Officer, and upon verification, the Contracting Officer will modify the contract price. The contactor must notify the Contracting Officer of decrease in price and the contract price will be modified.  The clause protects the contractor and the government from fluctuations in market prices.  Practical application of this clause may call for price adjustment upon receipt of each order.  
PRODUCTS:
- Gasoline- Gasohol- Diesel #1- Diesel #2
LOCATIONS:

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHTSolicitation Number: Sol-CI-12-00005Title: Laser Based N2O Measurement SystemTHIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR WRITTEN INFORMATION ONLY.THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NOCONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.SYNOPSIS 
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Assessment and Standards Division, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory (NVFEL), Ann Arbor, Michigan, intends to purchase a Laser Based N20 Measurement System.  The acquisition of this Commercial item will be subject to full and open competition and will be processed in accordance with FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is  334516 Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing.
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is mandated to measure nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from motor vehicles.  Work to date on measurement of N2O has indicated that N2O concentrations in dilute exhaust gas will range from 310 ppb to 1000 ppb, requiring a highly accurate analyzer.  
For the equipment specified, the contractor shall have total system responsibility, which shall include integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff, if required. The contractor shall be responsible for documenting measurement traceability and system acceptance.
The system will be installed in chassis test site D329 at the NVFEL.  This test site is equipped with a Horiba MEXA-7000 system for both continuous and bag analysis of criteria pollutants, and a Horiba CDTCS test cell host computer.
The analyzer will be installed directly on the concrete floor in the test cell.  The analyzer operation shall be integrated into the MEXA-7000 analyzer software and shall also be integrated into the CDTCS test cell host computer.  This integration shall include the ability to fully control the analyzer functions, and data collection, processing and reporting, in keeping with the current operation of the MEXA-7000 and CDTCS at NVFEL.		Only commercially available systems offering this demonstrated level of integration into a MEXA-7000 system and CDTCS test cell host system will be considered for this solicitation.
The N2O analyzer shall meet the requirements of 40 CFR Part 1065 in terms of features, performance, usage requirements and calibration/verification requirements.
The combined interference from the maximum concentrations of the interference gases (for example CO, CO2, and H2O) that are at least a high as that expected during testing shall not exceed ?5 % of the flow-weighted mean concentration of N2O expected at the light-duty passenger car standard of 10 mg/mi.
Zero and span drift shall each be less than ? 1% FSD over 4 hours.
The N2O analyzer shall have performance that provides robust chemical measurement at low and sub-PPM levels.  Analyzers shall utilize wide dynamic range technology and automatic range selection as required.
The linearization function shall be handled through the existing MEXA-7000 software and shall be designed to function according to the following parameters:a) Selection of up to a fourth order curve with the ability to select curve order.b) Option to allow the curve intercept to float or be forced to zero.c) Allowance to modify fit tolerance; default values shall be set at the minimum of 2.0% of point or 1.0% of full scale. Full scale in this sense shall be considered to be the highest concentration utilized in the linearization function.d) Secondary confirmation of curve fit and accuracy by utilizing an independent gas standard that is at an intermediate concentration; acceptable tolerance shall be modifiable in the same manner as curve fit tolerance above.  Default limit shall be ? 2.0% of point.e) Candidate curves shall not be made active automatically.
The contractor shall provide and install all necessary system plumbing, including heated sample lines, filters, heated and unheated sample probes and overflow calibration devices, and all required transfer tubing, fittings and valves. As installed there must be no contamination in sample plumbing that would be detectable on any range of the analyzer.  The analyzer shall have a purge function that includes back flush of sample lines.  This will be performed with zero-grade nitrogen.
The contractor shall provide plumbing for connection of analytical gases, and required utility gases, from an EPA-provided valve rack within approximately 20 feet, or less, of the instrument.  Gases will be supplied at nominal pressures specified by the contractor, regulated at the gas source.  Valve rack fittings will be for ? inch outside diameter tubing.  The contractor shall provide and install permanently-mounted stainless steel lines to connect to the valve rack and any additional gas shutoff valves, or regulators required by the contractor?s system. The ends of each line end shall be labeled with line number, gas type and nominal concentration
Plumbing for the transfer of zero and span gases, as well as the dilute exhaust samples, shall be of 316 stainless steel tubing passivated and electro-polished (Ra<10).  Short lengths of Teflon? tubing may be used to facilitate final connection to analyzers.  All solenoid valves shall have stainless steel bases and plungers constructed of a durable material which does not out-gas or otherwise change the composition of the gas flowing past them.
Each analyzer shall have one span gas and one mid-span gas inlet per active range.  Span gases may be shared between analyzers and ranges, where concentrations permit.  Span concentrations shall be between 85% and 95% of the nominal upper range concentration.  Mid-span gases shall be between 10% and 60% of the nominal upper range concentration.
Training to accommodate up to eight (8) persons shall be provided by the manufacturer and shall include full descriptions of all functions of the system, including hardware, software, operation and maintenance.  
The contractor shall provide on-site supervision of all installation, commissioning and acceptance activities.  All contractor personnel shall receive 1-hour briefing by EPA personnel on specific safety and security issues.  All contractor personnel and subcontractor personnel must comply with EPA/NVFEL safety and security measures while working at NVFEL.  
Award will be made on a Best Value, Technically Acceptable Basis.  All non-price evaluation criteria, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  Anticipated non-price evaluation criteria include demonstrated ability of the proposed system to meet or exceed the SOW requirements; past performance record under comparable contracts; and relevant corporate experience.  
It is anticipated that the combined synopsis/solicitation will be posted after January 11, 2012.The current projected award date of this contract is February 15, 2012. The combined synopsis/solicitation will appear on the Internet under Solicitation Number Sol-CI-12-00005. It may be accessed through the EPA?s home page on the World Wide Web (www.epa.gov).

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) proposes to enter into a sole-source contract with the North Bethesda Marriott Hotel and Conference Center to provide conference space in support of the annual NRC awards ceremony meeting to be held on May 17, 2012.
<p>The objective of the awards ceremony is to provide a forum for the Chairman and Commissioners to recognize NRC employee accomplishments this past year. The NRC requires the services of a hotel and conference center within close proximity to NRC headquarters (HQ) to allow timely access for employees. To ensure NRC employee participation, the awards ceremony must be held within walking distance from the NRC Headquarters, located at 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, MD 20852-2738. Historical data has shown that by holding the meeting at a facility within walking distance from NRC HQ, employees will save an estimated 35 minutes per day (approximately $13,440 per day in cost savings to the NRC) compared with traveling to a facility that is not within walking distance. Furthermore, transportation (i.e., shuttle buses, metro fare cards) for NRC employees to attend the meeting at a farther location would add considerable costs to the NRC. NRC will save approximately $49,500 in shuttle bus or approximately $13,500 in metro fare card costs.</p>
<p>The North Bethesda Marriott Hotel and Conference Center is the only conference center that is located within walking distance from the NRC HQ that has the capacity to accommodate approximately 420 attendees for the meeting. The Marriott is located approximately 0.2 miles from NRC HQ and has extensive familiarity with NRC's security and meeting requirements as demonstrated by performing the annual Regulatory Information Conference in 2011, NRR All-Hands Meeting, the Integrated Regulatory Review Service Mission, and several other agency-wide and office-wide meetings. Therefore, the Marriott is the only conference facility that can meet NRC requirements in support of the awards ceremony.</p>
<p>This is not a request for competitive proposals. Request for copies of this solicitation will not be honored unless the respondent provides evidence showing their capability to perform the required services.</p>
<p>Statutory authority: 13.106-1(b)(1) Only one responsible source<br />.</p>

The announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number is 1097919. The solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-54, dated December 2, 2011.</p>

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF, OR SUBMIT A WRITTEN RESPONSE TO, THE FOLLOWING TECHNICAL EVALUATION FACTORS: The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: <strong>(1) The Contractor's ability to provide a Radiologist that is certified by the American Board of Radiology and is further certified by the College of Radiology Mammography Accreditation Program. = 30 points (2) The Contractor's Ability to provide consultations to other clinic Providers and work as part of a total healthcare team. = 20 points (3) The Contractor's Ability to interpret standard plain film radiography,ultrasound and mammography exams on regular film format or electronic imaging format. = 30 points (4) The Contractor's Ability to provide reports with a 72 hour turnaround time. = 20 points</strong> The Indian Health Service will make a separate determination of price reasonableness. The primary consideration in evaluating this criterion is which offeror can perform the task in a manner most advantageous to the government. Under best value principles, there is no requirement that a task order be awarded on the basis of lowest proposed cost. The award primarily on the basis of estimated costs may encourage the submission of unrealistically low estimates and increase the likelihood of cost overruns. Estimated costs must be reasonable for the tasks to be performed. If consideration is narrowed to choosing among proposals with approximately equal technical criteria as determined by the technical evaluation, cost information can become the determining criteria. Technical Criteria will be 60% and Cost will be 40% determining factors for this award.</p>

<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: both; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As the largest bilateral donor in Liberia, USAID works closely with the Government of Liberia (GOL) and strives to align program priorities with the country's priorities and goals. The Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW) has recently finalized Liberia's ten-year health policy and plan (2011-2021), which will feed into the next Poverty Reduction Strategy. USAID/Liberia has been providing technical assistance and inputs to develop this plan, which will focus on providing an Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS) to all Liberians and strengthening the health system building blocks. </span></p>

<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: both; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Health system weaknesses in Liberia continue to negatively impact efforts aimed at improving disease-specific health outcomes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>USAID/Liberia concentrates on several key health systems areas in its work, including human resources, financing, supply chain management, and the health management information system (HMIS). Across these areas, USAID collaborates closely with GOL to strengthen policies and implementation in coordination with other donors. </span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: both; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: both; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Financing the health system in Liberia continues to be a difficulty, and donor support finances the bulk of all primary and secondary service delivery. Approximately 6.7% of the overall GOL budget is allocated to the MOHSW; however, the overall health sector expenses far exceed this $25 million - which covers roughly 25% of the overall health costs. The donor community covers approximately 40%, and private out-of-pocket expenditures account for the remaining 35% of total health expenditures. Improved health financing is critical to Liberia's ability to make and sustain gains in health outcomes. With the new 10-year national health policy, the MOHSW is maintaining the temporary elimination of user fees until 2013, while initiating work to increase resource mobilization, improve allocation, and increase efficiency of utilization.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

Over the next several years, USAID will begin to direct funds to the MOHSW to contract international and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to implement jointly designed activities, a function that has previously been supported through intermediary USAID bilateral projects.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="mso-pagination: widow-orphan"><span style="LAYOUT-GRID-MODE: both; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) remains a challenge for Liberia and its citizens. Incidence of diarrheal disease is high, and access to improved water and sanitation is low. USAID's health program includes substantial support for WASH activities in Liberia. During 2011, USAID will manage two multi-year water projects aimed at improving WASH in rural and urban areas with measurable results in reducing the burden of disease and the impact of illness (particularly on women and girls). This assistance will contribute to building GOL capacity and strengthening coordination plans for improved WASH. While the rural project focuses on household and community level training and WASH promotion, the upcoming urban project will improve municipal water supplies through support to GOL and water system operating entities in three major secondary cities. </span></p>

<DESC><p>The following are the questions that have been received and the government's response to them:</p>
<p>Question 1: We need any historical data on volumes of waste generated during cleanings at each facility so we can determine quantities of drums needed. We are assuming we will need to provide drums for waste containerization as per Section 1.3.6 of the Performance Work Statement even though Chapter 10, section 10.1.1 of OPLAN 19-3 states that "Drum or containers for wastes generated by servicing operations will be provided by the 673 CES/CEANQHWC as necessary."</p>
<p>Answer 1: This contract represents a new approach to the OWS service and maintenance work. Historically, the contractor, in the process of cleaning the OWS unit would remove all of the water, oil, and sludge together into a vacuum truck. This truck would then transport all material to one location and separate out phases for drying. Therefore, the material to be disposed of was a dry "cake-like" material with a low moisture content. Unfortunately, changes in the regulations now prevent us from continuing this process. As a result, the sludge that will have to be removed and drummed during cleanings will have a much higher moisture contain and thereby greater volume. As a result, we have no way of knowing the amounts/volumes that will be removed from each location.</p>
<p>Question 2: CLIN 0002 lists a quantity of 21, but for the base period (1 Jan 2012-30 Sep 2012) there are only four (4) months of "Seasonal OWS Cleanings" for the three (3) specified buildings for a total of twelve (12)?</p>
<p>Answer 2: This is correct because the base year has been reduced to a 9 month period.<br />Question 3: Please confirm the methodology that will be used to evaluate the bids for this scope of work and the work histories of prospective bidders.</p>
<p>Answer 3: Please refer to FAR ADDENDUM 52.212-2 (B) within the solicitation for clarification.</p>
<p>Question 4: Please explain the deviation of a 3-year requirement--especially given that the Government has historically required 5 years.</p>
<p>Answer 4: The past performance evaluation considers each offeror's demonstrated recent and relevant record of performance in supplying products and services that meet requirement and it is in the best interest of the government. The government is changing the original 3 year past performance to 5 years.</p>
<p>Question 5: In the event, a contractor "teams" with another company with a higher level of experience in Oil/Water Separator maintenance, would that contractor get maximum benefit for the experience of the team if that contractor were to be the prime contractor on this project?</p>
<p>Answer 5: Please refer to FAR ADDENDUM 52.212-2 (B) within the solicitation for clarification. Total files size shall not exceed 4 MB.</p>
<p>Question 6: Since requiring experience in the past 3 years will preclude all local contractors from bidding this contract, would the Contracting Office consider experience in the past 5 years as being acceptable?</p>
<p>Answer 6: The government is changing the original 3 years past performance to 5 years. Please be sure to fully understand the Performance Work Statement; in that the methodology has changed significantly from what has been done in the past.</p>
<p>Question 7: The solicitation states that the price and past performance proposals should not exceed 25 pages - these forms are provided with the solicitation. (Ref pg. 40) Is there a page total on the Technical portion of proposal submittals?</p>
<p>Answer 7: The Technical portion of the proposal shall not exceed 25 pages.&nbsp; Total file size shall not exceed 4 MB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If hand carrying proposal on 5 or 6 December please deliver to Ms. Cindy Thompson in Suite 344.</p>

<DESC>The following is in response to questions that have been recieved:<br /><br />QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br /><br />Question 1: In Amendment #1 it was stated that for CLIN 0002, (seasonal<br />OWS Cleaning), the total quantity will be 12 for the base year, will the<br />Quantity change in the pricing sheet?<br /><br />Answer 1: The SF 1449 for CLIN 0002 should reflect 12 and has been changed<br />with this amendment.<br /><br />Question 2: While labor rates were provided for the base year, what rates<br />or escalation should be used for option years?<br /><br />Answer 2: Please visit the Department of Labor website for changes. The<br />Wage Determination that is currently incorporated in this solicitation is<br />the current DOL Wage rates and they are only updated when DOL issues a<br />change.<br /><br />Question 3: For CLINs 0004 (Receive &amp; Perform Routine Service Calls) and<br />0007 (Special Maintenance Projects), are we allowed to list a markup for<br />parts and materials used?<br /><br />Answer 3: No. Reimbursement&nbsp;is based on the actual price of parts and materials paid by the Contractor; profit, overhead and G&amp;A will not be allowed.<br />

<DESC>Contracting Office Address:
<p>Department of the Air Force, Air Force Space Command, Space and Missiles System Center Space Superiority &amp; Development Planning Directorates (SMC/SYK), 483 N. Aviation Blvd., El Segundo, CA, 90245</p>
<p>I. Description / Purpose:</p>
<p>1. The SMC Development Planning Directorate (XR) is issuing this presolicitation notice to provide the industrial base with information about XR's CHIRP+ WFOV payload acquisition and upcoming market research plans.</p>
<p>2. XR and the Infrared Systems Directorate (IS) are planning to hold an industry day in the second half of January 2012 to communicate to industry SMC's plan to procure up to three wide-field-of-view (WFOV), overhead persistent infrared (OPIR) sensors to be launched as hosted payloads or free-flier rideshares. XR and IS will also present to industry how these sensors will fit into IS's OPIR architecture and discuss future plans for integrating, launching and operating these sensors. In addition, XR and IS will be accepting Statements of Capability (SOCs) from companies interested in building the sensors and offering them the opportunity to have one-on-one meetings with program office representatives. The market research for the CHIRP+ procurement will be based mainly on the SOCs received at industry day; no sources sought synopsis will be posted on FBO either before or after the industry day.</p>
<p>3. The only procurement currently being actively coordinated is for the development and delivery of high TRL (Technology Readiness Level), flight-capable sensors. The sensors will be either 6-degree or 9-degree WFOV IR sensors intended for use primarily for battlespace awareness and secondarily for other OPIR missions. Cost will be a very important consideration, due to funding limitations. Currently, the Government is limited to spending $40 million or less per sensor. The Government intends to award three contracts for sensors to be developed and delivered within a 36-month schedule.</p>
<p>4. Two weeks prior to industry day, the Government will release the following documents and information: A draft Statement of Work (SOW); a draft Technical Requirements Document (TRD); SOC content and format requirements; and logistical specifics of the industry day. Currently, the industry day is planned to be held at SMC in El Segundo, California. The SOW and TRD are currently being drafted, and no drafts have been released to industry yet. The first draft releases will be for the formal industry day notice, which the Government plans to post to FBO in the first half of January.</p>
<p>5. The Government is building a bidder's library where finalized draft documents will be posted. The draft SOW and TRD for Industry Day will be posted to this site as soon as they are ready. The process for gaining access to this site can take up to two weeks, so contractors are highly encouraged to apply immediately. The following information is relevant to gaining access:</p>
<p>a. The LAAFB Contractor Livelink Site Guide will inform your organization of your responsibilities.</p>
<p>b. All contractors need to fill out the Livelink User Agreement and the SAAR Form DD2875.<br /><br />c. Every contractor needs to have an Information Assurance Certificate which can be attained from the link. The link to the IA CBT: http://iase.disa.mil/eta/iaav9/iaa_v9/index.htm</p>
<p>d. Every contractor must have an External Certification Authority (ECA) or a Common Access Card (CAC) to use the Livelink environment. The ECA's are available at http://www.verisign.com/dod-interoperability/index.html. Contractors should purchase from this website.</p>
<p>e. Only contractors with SECRET Clearance verified through JPAS will be allowed to access the Bidder's Library. <br /><br />The LAAFB Contractor Livelink Site Guide, Livelink User Agreement and the SAAR Form DD2875 have been attached to this pre-notice. The Livelink User Agreement, SAAR Form DD2875, and a copy of the IA CBT Certificate should be submitted to the points of contact listed in Section II of this notice NLT 3 January, 2012 to allow sufficient time to process and approve access to the bidder's library.</p>
<p>6. The Government encourages participation from the small, disadvantaged businesses.</p>
<p>II. Point of Contact: All communication associated with this presolicitation notice and the upcoming industry day shall be submitted via email to the contracting POC for this procurement, Mr. George Sullivan, at George.Sullivan@losangeles.af.mil. The alternate POC is Mr. Andrew Mitchell, at Andrew.mitchell.ctr@losangeles.af.mil.<br /><br />III. DECLARATION: This notice is not a formal solicitation and is provided for informational purposes only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of any responses to this notice. Responses will be used by the Government for informational purposes only as part of its acquisition planning. Information obtained from responses to this notice will not be used to exclude potential future bidders on the CHIRP+ acquisition.</p>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY. WE ARE NOT SOLICITING PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME.<br><br>The Army has developed a reference model for The Army Enterprise Network Operations - NetOps known as The Army LandWarNet NetOps Architecture - LNA providing an objective target for how NetOps will be managed across the Army Enterprise.<br><br>The Army LNA is the baseline enterprise NetOps reference architecture for the Army's LandWarNet. As an integrated architecture, the LNA provides an enterprise level Army statement of NetOps requirements through the Operational, Systems, and Technical views. These views together depict a holistic approach to NetOps with functional capabilities designed to support NetOps products, software, tools or systems, evaluation/selection.<br><br>Achieving NetOps systems interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise Infostructure is challenging due to the extraordinarily large and diverse organizations and existing stove-pipe tools and systems. Standardizing a scalable NetOps toolset is an Army priority.<br><br>An optimal way to achieve standardization and increase NetOps systems interoperability and integration is to address the acquisition process. As a result, it is the intent of the Army to enforce Compliance of the Army's LNA Capabilities into the NetOps systems selection and acquisition process to enhance and ensure interoperability and integration across the Army Enterprise.<br><br>Army Regulation (AR) 25-1 mandates the assessment of NetOps products against the architecture to ensure they meet functional and interoperability requirements within the Army Enterprise. As a part of the Certificate of Networthiness - CoN approval process, all NetOps products - software, tools or systems must be compliant to the LNA.<br><br>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has responsibility to ensure all NetOps products are compliant to the LNA, prior to issuing a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN to acquire, field or connect to the Army's Enterprise. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS utilized on or for the LandWarNet, which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. These NetOps products securely manage, operate and maintain the network; they are not the network devices or elements themselves. NetOps software, tools, and systems are those products - COTS/GOTS which monitor and manage the networked devices within the Army Enterprise Infostructure. <br><br>LNA Compliance generally refers to the measurement of a NetOps product in meeting the Army LNA Key Performance Parameters - KPPs and interoperability requirements and standards. The heart of the LNA Compliance process is the initial product assessment mapping to the LNA Capabilities, validation of the products functional capabilities and data flow interaction with other LNA Capabilities within the LNA.<br>NETCOM/9th Signal Command has developed LNA Compliance Checklists for each of the Army's current LNA Capabilities. Posting of these documents on the FedBizOpps is to provide the criteria required for NetOps products to be compliant to the LNA. These Checklists are available to Industry, providing vendors the ability to review and perform assessments of their NetOps products against the LNA requirements. Vendors desiring to access these LNA documents should MAP their NetOps product to the appropriate LNA Capability(s) identified in the NETCOM/9TH Signal Command LNA Bin Chart.  To access the LNA Bin Chart scroll down to 'Additional Info' located near the bottom of this Synopsis page then place cursor and click mouse on URL text "LNA Compliance Checklists/Documents".                                                                                                                       <br>(Hyperlink to LNA BIN Chart is:  http://www.netcom.army.mil/LNA_Webpage/LNABIN.htm) <br><br>Compliance Checklists exist for each of the current LNA Capabilities and are linked via their respective capability block on the LNA Bin Chart identified above. To view LNA material related to any particular LNA Capability, click the text in the respective capability block of the LNA Bin Chart. This links to a Word Document which provides an overview or description of the specific LNA Capability, a graphical representation of the capabilities interface requirements with other LNA capabilities to include data exchanges, and further provides a link to the detailed LNA Compliance Checklists outlining functional and Interoperability requirements.<br><br>In order for NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet - LWN, to be considered for selection, Army requiring activities must obtain a Certificate of Networthiness from NETCOM/9th Signal Command, as stated in AR 25-1. See chapters 2-2, 2-15 thru 2-27, and 6-3. As a part of the CoN approval process, all NetOps products software, tools, or systems must be Compliant to the LNA. <br><br>Industry is encouraged to utilize these LNA Checklists to perform a self-assessment of their NetOps products to ensure their products compliance with the Army's LNA Compliance requirements. <br><br>It is recommended Army requiring activities utilize these checklists, as part of their market research, evaluation and acquisition process, for new or enhanced NetOps products, to ensure the products compliance to the LNA prior to seeking a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN from NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<br><br>When reviewing or preparing to acquire COTS NetOps products, for use on the Army LandWarNet, Army Requiring Activities should obtain a completed LNA Compliance Checklist, from the vendor, for the LNA capability to which the NetOps product maps. The completed checklist is the vendor's assessment of their products compliance to the LNA and will be viewed as the vendor's certification of their NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA functional and interoperability requirements.<br><br>Army requiring activities should e-mail completed LNA Compliance Checklist and supporting documentation to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team at compliance.team@conus.army.mil. Vendors should not directly submit their completed checklists to the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team.<br><br>These LNA Checklists and supporting documentation will be utilized by the NETCOM/9th Signal Command LNA Compliance Team in their assessment of the NetOps products compliance to the Army LNA, prior to a Certificate of Networthiness - CoN being granted by NETCOM/9th Signal Command.<br><br>Prospective procurement of such products will be advertised and procured by Army Agencies requiring products. <br><br><br>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY.

<DESC><strong>ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS<br /><br /></strong>1. What software will be required at NIST to use the design kit? Will ADS 2006 be adequate?<br /><br />2. As the NIST program progresses, NIST will want to add separate electronic control of the amplitude and phase of the fundamental in the 60 GHz-90 GHz frequency range and its second and third harmonics. This can be accomplished by separate amplitude and phase control circuits at the fundamental before multiplication, by separate amplitude and phase control circuits after multiplication, or some combination of the two. Does the vendor have standard designs for electronically controlled phase shifters, attenuators, and/or amplifiers with variable gain? Will it be possible to design electronically controlled phase shifters and attenuators in this technology?<br /><br />3. Please provide an example of the vendor's standard Intellectual Property agreement.
