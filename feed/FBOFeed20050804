<DESC>Background
CMS must estimate improper payments in the Medicaid program as directed by the Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA).  To implement error rate measurement in Medicaid, CMS will use a national contracting strategy.  Under this strategy, CMS will engage three contractors: (1) a statistical contractor; (2) a documentation/database contractor; and (3) a review contractor.  The statistical contractor will perform all statistical, sampling and error rate calculation functions.  The documentation/database contractor will gather medical policies and other necessary information from States; will maintain a database of the medical policies (along with quarterly updates to these policies) and will gather medical records from providers.  All information collected by the contractor will be maintained in electronic format.  The review contractor will perform the data processing and medical reviews in those States selected for review.  For Fiscal Year (FY) 2006, all three contractors will exchange information and will work together to produce the Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) error rates.  CMS anticipates a separate procurement for each of these contractors.  
Description
A sole source procurement is contemplated for award to The Lewin Group Inc. of Falls Church, VA to perform all statistical, sampling, and calculation functions necessary to produce national and state-specific Medicaid FFS error rates for FY 2006.  These duties include selecting the states to be reviewed, determining the total sample size and the sample size by strata, stratifying the claims data from each selected state, drawing the claims sample and calculating the state-specific error rates and national error rate for Medicaid FFS.

The Lewin Group provided statistical and analytical services to CMS as needed to produce and report Medicare FFS error rates when CMS implemented the Comprehensive Error Rate Testing (CERT).  In addition, from the onset of the Payment Accuracy Measurement project, CMS has contracted with Lewin to serve as the project’s technical and statistical consultant.  Lewin assisted CMS in developing and refining the statistical methodology to estimate payment accuracy and payment error in Medicaid and SCHIP.  Lewin also was responsible for reviewing, validating, and approving the sampling plans of the participating states.  Lewin has also provided technical assistance to states in understanding and implementing both the payment accuracy and payment error rate models, for example, assisting states with stratifying the FFS claims by service type.  In addition to the general statistical and consultation assignments, Lewin also developed a sample size calculator that each participating state used to estimate the number of sampling units it would need to achieve certain confidence and precision levels.  Lewin also developed an error rate calculator that participating states have used to calculate their final payment accuracy and payment error rates. 

Lewin is uniquely qualified to perform the tasks in this procurement most economically and efficiently because it developed the statistical methodology used to calculate the Medicaid and SCHIP payment accuracy rates and payment error rates, is currently providing statistical support to CMS with the FY 2005 Payment Error Rate Measurement pilot project and will calculate the state-specific and national errors rates associated with this project.  Lewin has worked extensively with CMS in each pilot project and has an understanding of the complexities in stratifying FFS claims, developing sampling plans, determining sample sizes, and calculating state-specific and national error rates.  

This sole source procurement is being conducted pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. § 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), that only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency’s requirements.  CMS believes The Lewin Group is the only company that can provide CMS with timely and accurate technical support that will allow CMS to make the maximum effective use of the Medicaid FFS error rate findings. This contract will be awarded for a period of 26 months with no optional years.  

This is a notice of intent and not a request for quotations.  Businesses that recognize and can provide the required service described above must provide supporting evidence. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   The Government will consider all responses received NLT 3:00 PM EDT, 24 Aug 2005.  Responses shall be submitted to Monica N. Carter.

The Government has available the following Government Furnished Property (GFP): Two GP9 locomotives #1876 and #4609 are available for inspection at: 6233 Aspen Ave. Bldg 1701Hill Air Force Base, UT 84056. One GP40 is available at Military Ocean Terminal Sunnypoint (MOTSU) NC. All GFP is offered as is where it currently is. It is the contractor’s responsibility to inspect and ship the GFP. The following are the specifications for this procurement. Compliance-This procurem ent will consist of up to three commercial off-the-shelf electric-hybrid switcher locomotives with 2,000-HP equivalent tractive effort. This RFP is not intended to provide developmental costs, engineering costs or procedures to produce hybrid locomotives.  For the purposes of this procurement, battery electric-hybrid means that tractive effort is provided entirely on battery power where the batteries in turn will be recharged by the engine generator set on an as needed basis only.  Locomotives with parallel hybrid-electric drivetrain configurations are considered as locomotives that obtain tractive effort from power delivered from an engine generator set in combination with battery power for additional tractive effort and are unacceptable for this RFP.  Due to the location, type of use, an d environmental considerations where the locomotives will be operating, Battery  Electric-hybrid locomotives, due to their large bank of batteries, exhibit longer run times on battery power only (without the startup of the genset) and  provides for safer conditions while operating in hazardous areas and as an environmental requirement for noise and emissions.  The battery hybrid-electric locomotives in this specification shall provide better fuel efficiency, less pollution and quieter operations when compared to diesel-electric switcher locomotives in the 1,000 to 2,000 horsepower range.  The typical values required in this specification are 80% or higher drop in NOX and particulate matter and 50% or higher drop in greenhouse gases.

<DESC>The U. S. Coast Guard (USCG) intends to negotiate a sole-source contract with Dakota Technologies, Incorporated (Dakota), 2201-A 12th Street North, Fargo, North Dakota 58102.  The USCG has a requirement for 57 each, Ballast Water Exchange Assurance Meters (BEAM), together with necessary accessories, consumables, training, technical and logistics support.  The BEAM units were designed, developed, and manufactured by Dakota under a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) contract.  The BEAM units are a battery-operated handheld meter, weighing less than five pounds, which are designed to assess the salinity and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) content of ballast water.  The BEAM units will be used by USCG field personnel, such as Marine Inspectors, Boarding Officers, and Port State Control Officers, to verify and enforce compliance with USCG regulations for the management of ships’ ballast water by mid-ocean ballast exchange pursuant to the National Invasive Species Act of 1996.  Dakota is the only known company that can provide a device capable of performing this mission and the required support.  Contracting with Dakota will avoid a substantial duplication of cost necessary for any other company to design, develop, and manufacture a device that is able assist the USCG to perform its mission in regulating ballast water exchange practices of ships engaged in foreign commerce.  The proposed contract is estimated to save in excess of $300,000.00, which would be required to fund a similar program of research and development with another company.  These duplicate costs are not expected to be recovered through competition.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.3.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, the Government will consider all proposals received from responsible sources by 2:00 P.M., Eastern Daylight Savings Time, August 18, 2005 at USCG Headquarters, Commandant (G-ACS-2B/EF), 2100 Second St., S.W., Washington, DC  20593-0001.  Offers may be faxed to 202-475-3905, or may be e-mailed to efeinberg@comdt.uscg.mil.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. See Note 22.

FAR Clauses: 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications, (Beginning January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will require the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, gov! ernment contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your company’s ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect ! their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help).  52.212-4 Cont! ract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, 52.212-5,Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders within this clause, the following clauses apply; 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities, 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity, 52.222-35, Affirmative Action for Disabled Veterans and Vietnam Era, 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities, 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era, 52.222-19 Child Labor--Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies, 52.225-13 Restriction on Certain Foreign Purchases, 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration, 52.232-18-Availability of Funds. 52.247-34, F.O.B. Destination.. IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR CONTRACTORS:   Any award resulting from the solicitation will include DFARS Clause 252.237-7003, Electronic Submission of Payment Requests. Section 1008 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 requires ! any claims for payments (invoices) under DoD contract to be submitted in electronic form. Wide Area Workflow-Receipt and Acceptance (WAWF-RA) is the DoD system of choice for implementing this statutory requirement.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis [on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)] with the Coriell Institute for Medical Research for an NHGRI Sample Repository for Human Genetic Research pursuant to the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is a five-year requirement for the acquisition, establishment, maintenance, and distribution of lymphoblastoid cell lines and DNA samples, and the establishment and maintenance of community outreach to the communities from which blood samples used to create the cell lines and DNA were donated.  Coriell will perform the following services: (1) take in new samples, establish and characterize permanent cell lines from the samples, and maintain and distribute the cell lines; (2) prepare, store, and distribute purified, high-quality DNA samples prepared from cell lines in the Repository; (3) maintain a computerized, comprehensive database providing detailed information on each cell line and DNA sample, and provide a web-based electronic catalog that lists the cell lines and DNA samples, any pre-formed sets of samples, and information about the samples in an easily accessible form; (4) publicize the Repository’s collection through distribution of information by a variety of means, publication of descriptions of the collections in relevant journals, paid advertisements, and other activities; (5) establish and maintain ongoing interactions with the communities that provided the samples through the production of newsletters and reports, visits to the donor communities, organization of visits from the donor communities to the repository, and providing funding for the Community Advisory Groups (CAGs).  The Coriell Institute is currently providing some of these services as part of a sole-source contract with the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS).  However, the number of samples collected for NHGRI-supported projects and the need for expanded donor community interactions have now exceeded the capacity of the current NIGMS contract.  Therefore, NHGRI has a need to establish its own contract for these services. The Coriell Institute is a non-profit organization established in 1946. It houses the world’s largest collection of human cell lines. Under the NIGMS contract, Coriell obtained samples for the International HapMap Project. The HapMap Project is the first international, large-scale project for which the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has provided funding in which samples were collected on a population basis for human genetic variation research.  The consent forms for the Project (approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of the relevant institutions in all participating countries and signed by the donors) specifically stated that the samples would be sent to and maintained at Coriell.  In addition, the international government approvals that were obtained in order to allow the export of the samples to the U.S. were obtained with the understanding that the samples would continuously be maintained at Coriell.  Coriell underwent extensive scrutiny of its policies in order to obtain the approvals from these foreign governments.  Moving the samples would necessitate several negotiations, including obtaining revised IRB approvals from multiple institutions in multiple countries, an extremely onerous process involving extensive duplication of effort, with an uncertain outcome.   Apart from these legal obstacles, moving the samples at this time could seriously erode the relationships of trust with the donor communities that have now been developed.  There is no assurance that consent would be granted by the various government officials and donor communities to move the samples, risking the loss of millions of dollars worth of research.  Although these considerations apply only to the HapMap samples, not to any additional samples to be collected in the future for other projects, it can be expected that similar issues with the communities that donate those samples will arise.  In addition, it would be administratively inefficient and expensive for NHGRI to establish two separate repositories, one for the HapMap samples and another for the additional future samples to be collected.  The repository functions of the Coriell Institute are vital to NHGRI’s mission of providing human cell lines and DNA samples from a unique and invaluable resource to biomedical researchers and NHGRI’s promise to maintain ongoing outreach with the donor communities.  Coriell is the only repository in the U.S. with experience in both: (1) the transformation, authentication, and distribution of human cell lines and human DNA; and (2) extensive ongoing interactions with communities in the U.S. and abroad that have donated samples for large-scale population-based research (as distinct from interactions with individual sample donors).  Thus, Coriell is the only facility in the country capable of performing all the requirements that would be acceptable to the countries and communities where samples were and will be collected.  The National Institutes of Health knows of no other organization that can provide these services.  Interested respondents may submit written capability statements demonstrating the ability to provide the same repository materials and distribution center, as well as the facilities and staffing to perform these services, as described above.  All responses must be received at the following address within 45 days from the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Contracts Operations Branch, Rockledge II, Room 6138, 6701 Rockledge Drive, MSC 7902, Bethesda, Maryland  20892-7902, Attention: Lynn Furtaw.  Responses providing insufficient information will not be considered.  This is not a Request for Proposals nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for software support on the integration of Shuttle Abort Flight Management (SAFM) flight software into the JSC real-time software integration and test facility (SITF) target processors.  It also requires the contractor to assess SAFM for reuse as the Autonomous Flight Management (AFM) system for Autonomous Rendezvous and Docking (AR&D).  In addition, the contractor shall support research into verification and validation (V&V) risks for autonomous software using SAFM as the reference model.  NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from General Dynamics C4 Systems.  A sole source procurement is justified because General Dynamics C4 Systems developed the SAFM flight software.  The contractor’s intimate knowledge of SAFM allows them to immediately begin integration of the software into the SITF.  The first major milestone of the project is to demonstrate the execution of SAFM in the SITF by September 2005.  If this requirement were competed, it would take another contractor over a year to acquire the necessary knowledge and background on the SAFM architecture, algorithms, and Input/Output to be able to properly integrate it into the SITF.   This delay is not possible due to the time constraints of the requirement.  Furthermore, the time it would take for a new vendor to acquire the SAFM knowledge would substantially duplicate the costs the Government has already incurred on the current and past contracts and subcontracts with General Dynamics C4 Systems. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on August 12, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI5090 and is being issued as a Notice of Intent.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-04.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 325414, which has a business size standard of 500.  The National Institute of allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure services from Tretragenetics the only known company that specialized in Tetrahymena expression system.  The company holds the US patent of “recombinant expression of heterologous nucleic acids in protozoa” (US6,846,481 B1). They have considerable success expressing similar GPI-anchor membrane proteins from other protozoan parasites (including Plasmodium) using this system.  NIAID has developed malaria vaccine candidates that need to be tested for expression using an expression system that Tetragenetics owns a patent.  The goal is to express biologically active, correctly folded recombinant proteins at high enough levels to carryout pre-clinical studies. Due to the complex structure of Pfs48 and Pfs230, the efforts to express these proteins in conventional systems such as E. coli or yeast have failed to produce proteins with native confirmation.  Tetragentics is to advise on the (1) Consultation of gene design - optimal constructs for overexpression of P. falciuparum genes for Pfs48/45 and Pfs230. Selection of N- and C-terminal signal peptides; correct placement of fusion tags and restriction sites for cloning, qty-1, (2) Expression vector - material supplied: 20 ug pMTT1 T. thermophila expression vector containing a) Cd++-sensitive metallothionein promoter; b) downstream transcriptional processing sites from the Beta-tubulin 1 gene of T. thermophila; and, c) Hind III and BamH I restriction sites for insertion of foreign genes, qty-1, (3)  DNA cloning - Plasmid DNA (pMTT1 containing relevant inserts) will be transformed into E. coli K-12 bacterial strains, amplified, subjected to large-scale purification, restriction endonuclease digestion and re-purification, qty-1, (4) Gold coating - gold microcarriers will be coated with DNA at optimal concentrations for transformation of T. thermophila strain CU522, qty-1, (5) Transformation and Section - microcarrier bombardment and selection of transformants: Coated microspheres will be introduced into T. thermophila strain CU522 using biolistric bombardment and positive trasformants selected by growth in the microtubule-stabilizing agent paclitaxcel. Transformation will be verified by PCR using appropriate primers. A minimum of 5 positive transformants (cell lines) for each gene construct will be produced and supplied to NIAID, qty-1, (6) Verification of protein expression - Recombinant T. thermophila cell lines be examined for protein expression by Western blotting analysis of cells and culture supernatants using protein-specific antibodies (supplied by NIH) or antibodies against the 6Xhis tag, followed by appropriate secondary antibody conjugates linked to HRP.
Large numbers of shake flask will be used to screen for optimal expression.  Tetragenetics will verify expression from each construct via western blot using protein specific antibodies (supplied by NIAID laboratory).  The contractor shall: a) provide transformed cell lines and cloning vectors b) provide screening testing for expression within 12 weeks of receiving the test clone, c) provide all relevant data for the construction of cell lines, d) provide estimations of protein expression levels from each cell line submitted, e) provide the NIAID laboratory with at least five (5) transformed cell lines from each vaccine candidate 1) Pfs48/45 and 2) Pfs230, f) Provide advice on the proper growing conditions of the cell lines and induction of protein synthesis using the appropriate promote system, and e) experience personnel.   The contractor shall supply all necessary material to perform the studies all relevant data for the construction of transformed cell lines along with estimates of protein expression levels to the NIH Malaria Vaccine Development Branch.  In addition, Tetragenetics will provide NIH with a minimum of 5 transformed cell lines for each version of the Pfs48/45 and Pfs230 gene noted above for subsequent purification of protein. Consultation on optimal growth of cells and induction of protein synthesis using the cadmium-sensitive MTT1 promoter will be provided at no cost.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Scott Fogle, Purchasing Agent, Phone (513) 487-2049
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541330   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Reaction Engineering International, for Modeling Support for Incineration of Building Decontamination Residue.  The current NAICS code is 541330. Based on EPA's knowledge of this Modeling Support, there are features covered in the  specifications that may have unique capabilities to particular vendors.  These features include: The contractor shall model the behavior of chemical  and biological (CB) agents bound on common porous building materials in 4 types of incinerators: 	- EPA Pilot-Scale Rotary Kiln Incinerator Simulator located in RTP, NC 	- Commercial Med-Path Incinerator 	- Commercial Hazardous Waste Burning Rotary Kiln 	- Commercial Waste-To-Energy Stoker  Facility Emphasis will be placed on modeling incinerator failure modes and transient emissions.  Failure modes can occur when the normal high temperature turbulent pathway that material takes through the incinerator is bypassed.  Transient emissions occur when batch or semi-continuous feeding  operations result in operational spikes and pressure excursions that can result in material blowing out around seals, depleting available oxygen, or triggering waste feed cutoff events. Biological and chemical agents of concern to be modeled include: 	- Bacillus Anthracis (anthrax) 	- GB  (Sarin) 	- VX 	- HD (Mustard) Building materials of concern to be modeled include: 	- carpet 	- ceiling tile 	- wallboard 	- particle board 	- outdoor materials (e.g., brick, concrete, asphalt) REI developed and validated chemical kinetic mechanisms, for the destruction of military nerve agents,  including VX and GB.  In addition, REI used their expertise to couple these kinetic mechanisms with complex fluid dynamics simulation code developed in-house at REI in order to examine issues related to the potential release of CW agents from hypothetical failure modes from the Army's chem. demil  facilities.  The kinetic mechanisms for GB, VX, and HD, developed by REI (with close collaboration with the Army) are unique and are the property of REI.  REI also developed a methodology to utilize bench-scale data on destruction of BW agents, and create thermal destruction kinetics for Bacillus  Anthracis (anthrax) simulants. However, any firm believing it self capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the  posting of this notice.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b), with Amersham Biosciences, to purchase a visualization system.  The current NAICS code is 334516. Based on EPA's knowledge of the visualization system, there are features covered in the specifications that may have unique capabilities to particular vendors.  These features include: The Environmental Carcinogenesis Division requires a visualization system to meet the Agency's ongoing  research needs to visualize radio-labeled and fluorescently labeled molecules on a variety of two-dimensional matrices.   Minimum Specifications for the Visualization System: 1.  The instrument shall be capable of performing storage phosphor analysis of 2-dimensional samples containing 14C, 3H,  and 32P using existing phosphor storage screens in sizes of 20 cm x 25 cm and 35 cm x 43 cm. 2.  The instrument shall be capable of storing data in files with 16-bit dynamic range and with a minimum pixel size of 10 microns.		 3. Instrument shall be capable of performing chemiluminescence analysis  on 2-dimensional samples 4.  Instrument shall be capable of performing fluorescence analysis using red, green, and blue laser excitation, and must be able to quantitate FAM, Cy3, and Cy5 fluorescence on 2-dimensional samples including microarrays. 5. Analysis software shall be capable of performing  pixel volume integration on user-defined regions of interest, as well as on defined array grids. 6.  Software shall be compatible with data files generated by ImageQuant TL version 2003.02 and ImageQuant version 3.22.  Software must be able to read .gel files and export images to either .tiff or  jpg files. 7.  Instrument shall be UL listed. Compatibility with existing data files and storage phosphor screens is absolutely essential for the integrity of ongoing research projects, and the ability to perform chemiluminescence and multi-dye fluorescence analyses is critical to meet the needs  of the Division's strategic research plan.   However, any firm believing it self capable of meeting the EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.  Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days  of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009; PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Dr. Zhang Jian Qiang, Director, Hunnan International Technopolis Shenyang 3 Century Road, Hunnan New District, Shenyang, China 110179 Phone: (8624) 2378-9885, Fax: (8624) 2378-9879.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms, which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an integrated coal gasification, power generation and district heating project in Shenyang, China.

The Hunnan International Technopolis Shenyang (HITS) was established in 2003 through a partnership between the Shenyang local government and a Singapore-based professional park development company, Ascendas Real Estate Management System.  The HITS is located within Shenyang City in Liaoning Province, and is a development zone containing a residential area, a university town, a business district and a new high technology industrial zone.  As noted, it is an extension of the larger Hunnan industrial zone that was established in 1988 and now contains some 6,000 companies, including multinational companies such as GE, Microsoft, and NEC, among others.

The establishment of this park requires the Shenyang local authority to supply the land and for HITS to supply all utilities and services associated with the park, including power, water, heating and cooling, and waste/garbage disposal services.  HITS has worked with various Chinese energy sector agencies and private sources to develop an integrated utility facility proposal that is based on the primary use of local coal resources to generate power, district heat and steam, and use of local waste/garbage as a supplemental source of fuel.  The concept of coal gasification for subsequent multi-purpose use, known as “polygeneration”, is being widely discussed in China today and is a priority subject of the China-U.S. Energy Policy Dialogue led by US-DOE and involving participation by leading U.S. energy and service companies.  

The polygeneration system planned for use by HITS involves Integrated Gasification- Combined Cycle (IGCC) technology.  IGCC converts coal into a combustible gas called syngas, which is then burned in gas turbines to generate electricity, and then hot exhaust gas is used to generate steam to drive steam turbines and produce district heat and process or by-product steam.  Beyond these multiple products, the concept would also use syngas as a feedstock to co-produce fuel methanol and other chemical and petrochemical derivatives.  The technologies under consideration for this project are currently Texaco-Chevron’s coal gasification and purification technology, GE’s combustion and steam turbine technologies, and Air Products’ air separation processes.  As these are proven and available commercial technologies technical viability is not an issue.  The principal questions concern the economic viability of the technologies individually and jointly.  Furthermore, this project is dependent on a number of social, environmental and strategic factors.  The HITS is requesting the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funding to support a feasibility study that will assist them in technical analysis and plant design, economic and financial analysis, and implementation planning to establish the polygeneration project’s overall viability and finance-ability.  The study would assist HITS and other local authorities in Shenyang to devise the economic parameters and technology options for the establishment of coal gasification, garbage gasification, methanol synthesis and conversion processes of the proposed polygeneration plant.  The successful implementation of the project will substantially improve private sector development in the North East region of China, promote advanced clean energy production technology throughout China, and lead to a transfer of advanced U.S. energy technology. USTDA support for this study will achieve significant developmental impact in northeastern China while improving U.S. competitive advantage in China’s energy industry. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a U.S.$523,869 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 5 P.M., TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2005 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>The Program Support Center Acquisitions Branch knows of only a single source capable of accomplishing this requirement and intends to award a five month simplified acquisition for The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to CHD Research Associates, Inc., 5525 Twin Knolls, Road, Suite 322, Columbia, MD 21045.  The objective of this acquisition is to purchase two (2) dataset analyses from the Nursing home data which come from CMS’s Minimum Data Sets and the other from home health care data from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set for inclusion in the 2006 reports.  These reports assist AHRQ in addressing the health care needs of individuals with disabilities and who need chronic care.  To that end the contractor shall conduct analyses of long stay nursing home measures by race/ethnicity for Calendar Year (CY) 2004 in the following areas of concentration – bedfast, incontinent, catheter, pain restraints, high and low risk pressure sores, urinary tract infections, weight loss, ADL decline, depression, mobility, re-hospitalization; conduct analyses of short stay nursing home measures by race/ethnicity for CY 2004 – pressure sores, pain and delirium; conduct analyses of home health care measures by race/ethnicity for CY 2004 – improvement in upper body dressing, improvement in bathing, stabilization in bathing, improvement in toileting, improvement in transferring, improvement in ambulation/locomotion, improvement in management of oral medications, improvement in pain interfering with activity, improvement in dyspnea, improvement in urinary incontinence, improvement in confusion frequency, and acute care hospitalization.  This vendor has the unique capability in that they already have access to files in the format needed for these analyses and can consequently run these needed analyses more efficiently and effectively.

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with a single source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  Interested parties capable of responding to the requirement may submit a capability statement specifically identifying their ability to accomplish this requirement.

<DESC>Customs and Border Protection (CBP) intends to award a Sole Source Contract to Northrop Grumman Information Technology (NGIT) for the purchase of additional License Plate Reader (LPR) and Vehicle Counter System (VCS) equipment/components, installation and program management/logistical services in support of CBP’s continuing effort to install LPR and VCS equipment across the Southern and Northern Borders of the United States.

Through a combination effort, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and NGIT (formally Perceptics Corporation) initiated a program that successfully developed and evaluated a License Plate Reader (LPR) system from 1993-1997. As a result of this development and evaluation effort, CBP implemented, in partnership with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the initial LPR installation contract in 1998.  

The License Plate Reader (LPR) system automatically locates, reads, and communicates license plate information to the Treasury Enforcement Communication System (TECS).  TECS then automatically queries its database for law enforcement information associated with that license plate and provides the CBP officer with the response information.  The LPR image is processed through TECS and it provides alphanumeric characters, along with the state/province of origin for that license plate. As an enhancement to the LPR system, CBP also developed a Vehicle Counter System (VCS) in 2000.  The VCS capability utilizes the LPR equipment to count the number of vehicles passing through each lane as they enter the United States. The information is computerized for tabulation purposes/management reporting on the number of vehicles crossing the borders per day, per lane, in half-hour increments and is able to maintain a one-year tabulation on a rotating monthly basis. 

By the end of FY 2005, there will be 390 LPR and 60 VC Systems installed on the Southern and Northern Borders of the United States.

In a continuing effort to maintain system compatibility among Ports of Entry (POE) and the existing maintenance program, along with system integration and compatibility as it relates to the Treasury Enforcement Communication System, it is CBP’s intent for NGIT to be responsible for providing all program management and logistical support, all equipment/components, software changes, installation, testing, modification, verification and documentation as required.  NGIT currently owns the data rights to the software, specific hardware, processes, methods and algorithms that are used to support the LPR and VC Systems.

This four (4) year contract will include the purchase of equipment/components of up to approximately fifty-four (54) LPR and thirty-two (32) VC Systems, along with installation and program management/logistical support services.  

All responses are due NLT than COB Thursday, 11 August 2005.
Responses shall be in the form of e-mail to terence.lew@dhs.gov

NGA will provide background information that highlights how DNA has changed state criminal justice systems and will highlight recent state actions and they will explore issues such as the expansion of DNA testing for example for high volume crime, the use of DNA in cases involving the missing or unidentified dead and other ways DNA has had an impact in state criminal justice systems.   The focus of this NGA will convene small advisory groups consisting of state policymakers, policy advisors, researchers and practitioners.  The National Governors Association is the official network and research arm of all United States Governors.  They are the sole organization authorized to create and disseminate information to Governors and policy advisors that represents the official view of the organization.  Based on NGA’s  unique access to, and credibility with, the Governors, it is necessary that they author these reports.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research and Applications Branch (SRAB) plans to contract on a sole source basis with Instituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regena Elena, 229, Rome, Italy for: Improving Incidence and Prevalence Estimates in US at State Level:  implementing new survival methods.   The acquisition is being conducted under the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  Background:  The statistical method denoted MIAMOD (Mortality Incidence Analysis MODel) has been developed by researchers from the Instituto Superiore di Sanità in Rome, Italy. The MIAMOD method involves estimating incidence and prevalence from mortality and survival. Mortality data is available for the entire US at state level. Survival can be estimated at state level by applying an ecologic regression model of SEER survival on social-economical variables available at national level. A previous study “Projection of breast cancer incidence and prevalence in US at state level” was funded to investigate the performance of the PIAMOD/MIAMOD methodology in estimating breast cancer prevalence at states (smaller areas than nationally) and to provide breast cancer prevalence at the state level.  The Statistical Research and Applications Branch in the DCCPS at NCI, is interested in obtaining estimates of cancer prevalence at the state level. These estimates are going to be published on the State Cancer Profiles Web site. The Instituto Superiore di Sanita under the direction of Dr. Roberta De Angelis will be responsible for managing and conducting the research. Dr. De Angelis and her team of researchers are leading experts in the development of the methods and application for estimating chronic diseases incidence and prevalence.  They developed the software (MIAMOD/PIAMOD) necessary to calculate the required incidence and prevalence data.  This software has also been extensively applied to cancer data from Italy, Europe and SEER.  The Instituto Superiore di Sanita, Centro Nazionale di Epidemiologia is the only known source to the NCI that can successfully complete this project.  Period of Performance:   one year from date of award.  This is a notice of intent not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on August 19, 2005.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist at gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Supply Center, Philadelphia (DSCP), on behalf of the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), intends to negotiate a Sole Source contract to sustain the USMC Improved Load Bearing Equipment (ILBE) Pack System currently being fielded under MCSC contract M67854-03-D-3025.  The requirement is to purchase sustainment quantities for the entire ILBE Pack System, manufactured by Propper International.  The USMC ILBE Pack System is a proven technology and with direct Marine input that maximizes the mobility and survivability of the individual Marine.  The Marine Corps is looking for sustainment to the ILBE Pack system that is readily producible, simple, functional, durable and lightweight.  The ILBE Pack System is a commercial item based on the Arc’Teryx Equipment Incorporated commercially available Bora 95.  The ILBE pack system is the only known domestically manufactured system that is capable of transferring the shear loads using a waist belt made solely of laminated foams.  This is possible due to a unique combination of open cell foam, close cell foam, special glues, heating and cooling.  Arc’Teryx has exclusively licensed their technology to Propper International.  Currently, it is believed that no company worldwide has been able to duplicate the Arc’Teryx process.  

This item is sole source to Propper International. Drawings are not available.  No Request for Proposal is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties may submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement, to include descriptive literature, within 15 days of this announcement to the contact person listed above. This requirement is subject to the Berry Amendment  (10 USC 2533 a) and the NAICS code is 314911

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The announcement of solicitation 2005-Q-01129 posted on July 18, 2005, whereby CDC intended to compete a requirement  for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of airborne fiber samples using two modifications of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Direct-Transfer Method (10312, 1995-05-01 is hereby modified to cancel the competition and reissue this notice indicating that this requirement shall now be processed as a sole source action to EMS Laboratories in Pasadena, CA.  To perform the comparison under the initial competitive announcement, CDC would need to release the Berman TEM counting method to the public.  At the time of the original posting,  it was believed that the interagency agreement between NIOSH and the EPA granted NIOSH the rights to release the Berman method.  However,  NIOSH has since discovered that the Berman TEM modification method was submitted under a prior EPA contract  containing FAR Clause 52.227-14, Alternate II (June 1987) which granted the Government only limited rights to the data with no right to disclose the data outside the Government without his written permission. Since we are unable to release the Berman TEM counting method, a determination has been made that CDC will issue the purchase order to EMS Laboratories for this comparison because Berman previously disclosed his method to EMS for analysis work in the past. Therefore, performing this requirement would not violate any nondisclosure agreements.
Point of contact is Jenny Bayer, e-mail address is jmh8@cdc.gov.  No phone calls please.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to post an additional question and answer to the above referenced Broad Agency Announcement.  All other terms and conditions remain unchanged:

Question:  The subject solicitation requires a “Summary of Cost, Deliverables, Schedule, and Milestones” in Section B.  Does this refer to the cost of the work covered in the proposal or the capital costs and annual maintenance/operations of the technology when implemented?

Answer:  In Volume I, Section B of the proposal, under “Cost, Deliverables, Schedule, and Milestones,” the offeror should provide a summary of the cost, deliverables, schedule, and milestones for the demonstration of the technology at the proposed test sites for the project.  The cost estimates are to be made for the actual work being proposed -- not cost estimates for the technology after the demonstration project is completed and the technology is rolled out.   
On the other hand, in Volume I, Section C, subsection entitled “Description of Technology” of the proposal, the offeror should provide a summary of the capital costs and annual maintenance/operations costs of the technology when it is ready for implementation after the demonstration project is completed and the technology is rolled out.  
As stated in a previous modification to this solicitation, the assumption (about a group of three truck stops within a 50-mile circle, each with 50 parking spaces) does NOT apply to the demonstration project because it may not be practicable for all proposed test sites.  This assumption applies for the technology after the demonstration project is completed and the technology is rolled out.  The assumption is required for making the cost estimates so that the cost estimates for different technologies proposed by different bidders can be evaluated on the basis of a common assumption.

The proposed contract actions are for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  In accordance with FAR 5.203(a), interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement within the response date specified above in order to be considered by the Government.

<DESC>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY A critical need exists to acquire Construction Equipment (CE) Material Handling Equipment (MHE) Add on Armor (AoA) Crew Protection Kits (CPK) for the following systems (minimum and maximum quantities will be provided at time of Request for Proposal release ). 	Grader 130G 	2.5 Cubic Yard Loader MW24C 	Scraper 621B					 	Tractor Full Tracked D7G/D7GwRPS		 	HYEX	 JDC230CLR					 	22 Ton Crane AT422T				 	VIB Roller CS563D	 	5 Cubic Yard Loader H100				 	HS Compactor 815F 	LRT 110 7.5 Ton Crane 	530S Pneumatic Roller	 	SEE feasibility Study		 The systems listed above are used worldwide by U.S. soldiers, with a large number currently being operated in both Iraq and Afghanistan.  They are extremely vulnerable as potential targets from small arms fire (7.62mm AP rounds) and improvised explosive de vices (IEDs).   Acquisition Strategy The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for up to two (2) each, five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts for the design, prototype build, test, production, delivery of a Level III Technical Data Package (T DP), and installation of the CE Crew Protection Kits in Iraq and Afghanistan by the selected contractor. This function can be completed by U.S. citizens or third country national, but offerors are responsible for finding people who can complete the install  in a timely and satisfactory manner, and who can get onto the installation. The design, prototypes build and test efforts are on an accelerated schedule to meet the critical need for construction equipment operator protection.  Any orders issued under a p otential contract will be system specific.  Please note that we anticipate that most of the orders will be placed during the initial two years of the 5 year IDIQ contract.  The selected contractor may be required to have access to classified data and shall be required to comply with the requirements of DOD 5220-22-M National Industrial Security Program.  The Government will use source selection procedures to select the offeror whose proposal represents the Best Value to the Government.  An offerors submission must be a complete stand-alone proposal addressing all of the RFPs requirements.  The Government  reserves the right to award this contract without conducting discussions.  An offerors proposal must be comprehensive, fully responsive to the information requested in the RFP and reflect the offerors best prices. This is an accelerated acquisition.  Offerors are required to propose materials that have already been tested and approved by the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to provide at least Class 3 Protection  as defined in the attached Analysis of Threat Projectil es for Protection of Light Tactical Vehicles (please see the ARL link that is provided on this webpage).  Offerors who are proposing the use of materials not previously tested and determined by the Government to provide this level of protection will not be  evaluated.   Contract award is needed as soon as possible to facilitate the installation of CE MHE AoA CPK on the aforementioned systems in Iraq and Afghanistan.  If you are interested in receiving the RFP when it is issued please notify the contract specialist, Ms.Toni Spalding via email at toni.spalding@us.army.mil.

<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to negotiate and award a sole-source contract to Carlisle Research, Incorporated (CRI), Van Nuys, California for non-personal services for the life-cycle software management and upgrade of the USMC’s AN/TYQ-23(V)4 Tactical Air Operations Module (TAOM) main computer software.  The AN/TYQ-23(V)4 is a transportable, modularized, automated command and control element that provides automatic acquisition, identification, and tracking of all aircraft, Air Breathing Targets (ABT) and Theater Ballistic Missiles (TBM) and directs air defense for its area of responsibility.  The USMC has adopted the main computer software program developed by the United States Air Force (USAF) Ground Theater Air Control System (GTACS) Software Consortium for the USAF Modular Control Equipment (MCE), a separate version of the AN/TYQ-23 TAOM.  This allows the USMC to leverage software development and Joint Interoperability Testing and Certification for Li! nk-16 the USAF has accomplished.  CRI is one of the major contributors to the USAF GTACS Software Consortium.  The initial step in the combination of these programs was accomplished under CRI contract M67854-00-C-2108 and additional collaborative efforts were accomplished under CRI contract M67854-03-D-2011.  This effort is follow-on to the previous contracts.  The GTACS Software Consortium has developed additional capabilities, which have application to the USMC TAOM main computer software.  This new USAF version, T6.0, is to be integrated with the Marine Corps’ T5.1 to provide the TAOM with enhanced capabilities.  The support will include maintaining the AN/TYQ-23 main computer software program configuration and developing updated software releases for the USMC.  The contract will encompass engineering studies and analyses, preparation of software modifications and releases, informal and formal testing of software releases, and updating software configuration documentation!  to reflect the updated software programs, and maintenance of the system software test bed.  The Government anticipates a contract period of one year with four (4) option years.  No RFP is available for competitive bidding; however, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying the requirement.  No telephonic requests will be accepted.  All communications shall be in writing to the Contracting Officer.  Proprietary information shall be clearly identified.  Numbered note #22 applies.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Boulder CO proposed to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) Calmar Optcom, 755 North Pastoria Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94085.  NIST requires a femtosecond fiber laser with fundamental wavelength between 1550-1570 nm, and second-harmonic output wavelength between 775-785 nm. Both wavelengths shall be available in free-space, collimated output beams. In addition, there must be another output for synchronization with external equipment (this can be a separate fiber-coupled output at the fundamental wavelength that could be input to a high-speed photodiode, or could be an electrical output that is synchronized with the fiber laser pulses). The laser repetition rate must be 10 MHz. 	At the fundamental wavelength, the pulse width shall be less than 150 fs, and the output power shall be at least 10 mW average power, and at least 10 kW peak power. At the second harmonic wavelength, the pulse width shall be less than 300 fs, and the output power shall be at least 10 uW average power and at least 10 W peak power. The output at the fundamental wavelength shall be linearly polarized with a polarization extinction ratio greater than 20 dB. The laser must have a stable repetition rate with a method for locking the repetition rate to an external source (most likely achieved with a piezo stretcher in the fiber laser cavity, and a port for control of the stretcher). Tunability of the repetition rate with the piezo stretcher shall be at least plus or minus 200 Hz. The vendor shall provide at least a 1 year warranty. The vendor shall provide at least 2 references from customers who have received similar systems. Delivery shall be within 3 months after receipt of the order.

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). This notice is for information purposes only. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether on not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government’s best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or e-mail before August 18, 2005. Anticipated award date is August 19, 2005.

<DESC>Purpose:  This Sources Sought Synopsis is requesting responses ONLY from small businesses that can provide the required services under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 517410, Satellite Telecommunications Carriers/Resellers, with an associated size standard of $12.5M receipts/year or less.  In addition to Small Businesses, this Synopsis is encouraging responses from qualified and capable Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses, Women-owned Small Businesses, HUBZone Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Small Businesses, Small Business Joint Ventures, Consortiums and Teaming Partners.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued to assist the agency in performing market research to determine whether or not there are qualified and capable Small Businesses to provide systems engineering and integration (SE&I) services to procure and integrate Commercial Satellite Communications (COMMSATCOM) fixed satellite service (FSS) for the Department of Defense (DOD).

Background:  COMMSATCOM is an essential component of today’s DOD communications.  Current capacity of on-orbit Military Satellite Communications (MILSATCOM) systems cannot meet the increasing communications demands of the joint warfighters.  To augment the existing MILSATCOM capacity, DOD leases capacity on commercial satellites and procures or leases terminals to satisfy operational requirements.  The current services include leased C- and Ku-band COMMSATCOM world-wide bandwidth totaling approximately 4 GHz.  Along with leasing bandwidth, DOD contracts for associated SE&I services such as planning, engineering, network operations center support, service level agreement (SLA) management, operational spectrum monitoring of leased service, turn-key service, earth terminal installation, host nation agreements, licensing, troubleshooting assistance, and administrative support.  These services are obtained through multiple contractors that procure bandwidth from multiple global and regional service providers around the world.  Orders are placed for both short notice requirements (i.e., several hours) and more preplanned acquisitions (i.e., a few weeks).  Services are typically one year in duration and usually include option years.  The nature of the SE&I work requires a minimum facility clearance of SECRET and staff will require appropriate clearances.

Sources Sought:  Two or more qualified and capable small businesses must submit responses that demonstrate their qualifications to make a determination for a small business set-aside.  Responses must demonstrate the company’s ability to perform in accordance with the Limitations on Subcontracting clause (FAR 52.219-14).  Interested small businesses meeting the small business standard of NAICS code 517410 are requested to submit a response to the Contracting Officer within 30 days of issuance of this RFI.  Late responses will not be considered.  Responses should provide the business’s DUNS number and CAGE code and include a statement of self certification under the NAICS code.  Additionally, responses should include recent (within the past five years) and relevant experience (work similar in type and scope) to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers where the responder performed the relevant work.  Marketing brochures and/or generic company literature will not be considered.  Not addressing all the requested information may result in the Government determining the responder is not capable of performing the scope of work required.

Responses must describe the company’s demonstrated ability to perform the work detailed in the above background section and in the following specific areas:

1.	Lease FSS C-, X-, Ka-, and/or Ku-band bandwidth on a world wide basis on behalf of an enterprise consumer from multiple global and regional providers to include negotiating lease portability, where portability is defined as moving existing service from one transponder to another and one coverage region to another.  Responses must include: the amount of bandwidth leased; demonstrated examples where the amount of bandwidth leased has earned “valued” or “favored” customer status from the service providers; how this experience can be applied to the scale (i.e., up to 4 GHz world-wide) necessary to support DOD; and, the cost and timeliness of invoking lease portability.
2.	Determining feasibility (e.g., link budget analysis) and leasing technical solutions in response to high-level communications requirements including obtaining FSS licenses and host nation agreements/landing rights to activate the leased service.  Include metrics (shortest, average, and longest) on the company’s observed ability to obtain host nation agreements/landing rights.
3.	Implementing strategies that optimize performance or minimize enterprise lease costs (e.g., combining multiple FSS service requests across services/geographic areas to achieve economic order quantities) in an on-going or long term basis.
4.	Providing quick reaction FSS service (i.e., several hours) on behalf of an enterprise consumer including measured response times, if available.
5.	Integrating multiple sources of RF spectrum and FSS link and terminal status information into an enterprise-level situational awareness picture.  Monitoring and reporting performance and providing rapid customer response to outages/degradations including measured response times, if available

This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  Responses should be no more than 25 pages and will be provided electronically to commsatcom.rfi@disa.mil.  The government may request additional information from those responding to this RFI to adequately assess qualifications.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative cost incurred in response to this announcement.  Proprietary information or trade secrets should be clearly identified.  All information received that is marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the Sources Sought Synopsis will not be returned.

<SUBJECT>R -- Technical Assistance for Phase II-Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program
<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration intends to negotiate on a SOLE SOURCE basis with the Rural Health Policy Center at Penn State College of Medicine, 600 Centerview Drive, Suite 5301, PO Box 855, Hershey, PA 17033.  The purpose of this contract is to obtain technical assistance for grantees in the 2nd phase of the Delta States Rural Development Grant.  The Penn State College of Medicine’ Rural Health Policy Center (RHPC) has served as the National Program Office of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Southern Rural Access Program since 1997.  The Southern Rural Access Program grantees and partners have played a significant role in the Delta States program.  Since 2002, the RHPC has also served as a subcontractor under a Georgia Health Policy Center contractor to provide technical assistance to the Delta States grantees and other key rural health partners in all eight of the Delta States.  From 2002-2004, the RHPC staff played important leadership roles in planning conference calls and convening of workshops for Delta States grantees.  They have considerable expertise and a positive history in helping rural health agencies leverage additional public and private resources.  The RHPC staff has been involved with the Delta States program since its inception in 2001 and has a deep understanding of both of it’s initial thrust and how it has evolved over the past four years.  Because of their association with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Penn State College of Medicine Rural Health Policy Center has offered to provide a substantial portion of these services as an in-kind contribution.  (The Government would not have to pay the full cost of a resulting contract).  This in-kind contribution will result in substantial savings to the Government which would not be expected to be recovered through competition. The anticipated period of performance for a resulting contract would be one base year with 4 option years from the effective date of the contract. This will be a cost sharing type contract. The statutory authority for sole sourcing is 41USC 254 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 (ii) (A), “it is likely that an award to any other service would result in –(A) substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.” A Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition has been prepared by the Government.  This notice of intent is for informational purposes only, and is not a request for competitive proposals.  See Numbered Note 22.

Procurements under the purchase orders will be conducted on a sole-source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

The repairs/procurements are unique to the EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft and must integrate precisely with existing equipment in terms of form, fit, function, and compatibility.

<SUBJECT>89 -- Notice to Industry - Produce
<DESC>Notice to Produce Industry

SUBJECT:  New Business Model

          In an ongoing effort to provide our customers with best value solutions, the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) is modernizing its business practices in the [deleted] acquisition of Fresh Fruits and Vegetables (FF&V).  DSCP currently supports military installations, Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA), State USDA School Lunch Programs and Federal Native American Indian Programs via various methods throughout the continental United States. 

The DSCP, Subsistence Supplier Operations Directorate, Produce Division intends to contract with commercial full-line vendors to provide FF&V to DeCA, troop issue, school customers and Native American Indian Program participants within the Continental United States (CONUS).  Vendors will be requested to supply quality products that meet or exceed U.S. Grade No. 1 or equivalent and will be responsible for providing all necessary customer support, order processing, item catalog, electronic price updates, vendor billing, purchasing, distribution, and merchandising materials.  In addition, vendors will be required to provide all necessary licenses, permits, facilities, equipment, order processing, distribution services, inventory management, and personnel at their own facility/distribution center to receive, store, handle, sort and deliver all required FF&V items to the designated customers.  Contractors will be required to comply with all applicable domestic sourcing requirements.  Our current intentions will be regionalized and zones will be developed within the regions.  Contracts will be awarded on an all or none basis for each zone.  DSCP will utilize an Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC), where Delivery Orders (DO’s) will be placed electronically directly from the customer to the vendor.  The current Blanket Purchase Agreement procurement system will no longer be utilized.  DSCP is contemplating a base contract with options.  The terms of the base and options and the number of options will be determined based on the results of market research conducted with the produce industry.  

            We plan to hold round table discussions in the near future to discuss various issues with the new business model.   Information regarding the place, dates and agenda of the round table meetings will be provided at a later date.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The solicitation number is PR-NC-05-10603, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-04. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $10.0 million to qualify as a small business, is applicable. A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. This procurement is for Congener and Chiral Analysis of PCBs at the Twelvemile Cr./Sangamo-Weston Superfund Site.  The anticipated period of performance is September 1, 2005 - December 31, 2006.  BACKGROUND:  Between 1955 and 1978 the Sangamo-Weston capacitor plant released 400,000 lbs of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) into an adjacent stream, contaminating 26 km of Twelvemile Creek and portions of Lake Hartwell, a reservoir on the Savannah River.  Mitigation efforts included onsite treatment of contaminated sediment and groundwater and Monitored Natural Recovery (MNR) of downstream areas.  MNR efforts have primarily focused on Lake Hartwell, and few data exist to evaluate the recovery of Twelvemile Cr.  In 2003,  NERL began a two-year study to identify (1) the extent and magnitude of contamination in the stream and (2) pathways of PCBs through stream food webs.  Based on the preliminary findings, the National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) and National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) have expanded this study and require analyses of PCB contamination from a variety of matrices (e.g., soil, periphyton, tissue, etc.) collected from the stream ecosystem. In providing this support, the contractor shall provide the necessary personnel, facilities and equipment, and otherwise do all things necessary for, or incidental to the analysis of samples provided by EPA.  This shall include providing congener and chiral PCB  analysis of various sample matrices (following Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and required QA-QC standards, meeting required sample processing and holding times, and timely reporting of analytical results.  The support will require (1) PCB analysis:  Sample matrices will include sediment, fine benthic organic matter (FBOM), coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM, i.e., leaves), periphyton, semipermeable membrane device (SPMDs) extracts (provided by EPA), macroinvertebrate tissue, and fish tissue.  Samples will be analyzed for at least 107 individual and co-eluting PCB congeners; (2) Chiral analysis:  Chiral analysis is an emerging analytical tool for assessing PCB transfer through aquatic and riparian ecosystems.  Nineteen of the 209 congeners are chiral, meaning that they have axial asymmetry due to restricted rotations around the biphenyl bond (Wong et al. 2000).   Chiral congeners, usually referred to as "enantiomers" in the literature, were usually released as racemates in equal proportions.  Nonracemic proportions of enantiomers is strong evidence of enantioselective bioprocessing (Wong et al. 2001), so differences in the relative proportions of these chiral compounds are useful for understanding the fate and transport of PCBs through contaminated foodwebs.  Nine of the nineteen chiral congeners can be separated using a Chiral-Dex column (Wong and Garrison 2000; Table 2).  All samples will be analyzed for these nine chiral compounds.  Enantiomeric ratio (ER) and enantiomeric fraction (EF) will be calculated by the contractor following the methods of Wang et al. (2001); and, (3) Lipid, moisture, total organic carbon (TOC) analysis:  Lipids will be measured in all tissue samples (fish, Asian clam, macroinvertebrates), periphyton and CPOM.  Lipids will be analyzed using standard gravimetric methods.  Moisture will be measured in all samples (except SPMDs) using ASTM D2216.  TOC will be measured for sediment, CPOM, FBOM, and periphyton.  TOC will be measured using ASTM D4129-82M.  The following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items. Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD:  The Government will make an award to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is determined to be most advantageous to the Government, cost or other factors considered.  For this solicitation, all evaluation factors other than cost or price when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.  Selection Criteria:  This procurement will be awarded on a "best value" basis per the following evaluation criteria:  1.  Technical Approach                        	 Demonstrated technical approach to the Statement of Work.  Specifically, offerors shall demonstrate the ability to perform the required PCB analyses using the prescribed methods.

As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision:
Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jan 2005)
(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --
(1) The solicitation number;
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
(5) Terms of any express warranty;
(6) Price and any discount terms;
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address;
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(j) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees. However this requirement is unrestricted and all interested Contractors may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Alpha-Beta Sample Counter to be used in the Safety, Health and Environment Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD.  ***
 
***All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following line item:  Line Item 0001: The Contractor shall furnish one (1) each, Alpha-Beta Sample Counter.  

The Alpha-Beta Sample Counter shall meet or exceed the following specifications:

1. The system shall consist of a sample detector, background guard detector, shielding, counter electronics, operating system, sample changer, user interface, a computer for systems parameters programming and data logging, printer, monitor, input devices (keyboard and mouse), connecting cables, uninterruptible power supply/power surge suppression, cart, detector gas controls, connections and tubing, sample planchets, and any other components needed for appropriate turn key operation. Software based operating systems are strongly preferred but firmware operating systems will be considered if it can be demonstrated or documented that they provide the acceptable protocol programming and output format flexibility, QA tracking, data storage, and data transfer capabilities, and provide a reliable and simple user friendly interface.

Detector Characteristics:
2. The system shall utilize ¡§ultra-thin windowed¡¨ gas flow proportional detector capable of detecting alpha and beta particles.   (Venders may optionally propose using solid state detectors.  If they do they must provide documentary evidence that they will meet the same or better performance, detection, and background suppression specifications that are available with gas flow detectors. They shall also provide similar documentary evidence of reliability, stability, reparability, and cost effectiveness).  
3. The system shall be capable of detecting 0.005 uCi of contamination from sources including C-14, S-35, Fe-59, Cl-36, Cs-137, Co-60, I-131, Am-241, and U-238,  Detection efficiencies (CPM/DPM) shall be at least 15 percent for C-14, 35 percent for Cl-36, 45 percent for Sr/Y-90, and 40 percent for Am-241.
4. The system shall be capable of meeting detection requirements while operating in external gamma radiation fields up to 0.5 mR/hr.   

5. Lead shielding as well as a separate background ¡§guard¡¨ detector and subtraction algorithm shall be utilized to achieve optimum counting statistics and to minimize sample count times for an established minimum detectable activity.  Backgrounds shall not exceed 2 CPM beta or 0.2 CPM alpha while operating in typical background fields of 20 uR/hr

6. Changes in background (guard detector) count rates shall be apparent through an on screen display of the guard counts or by an automated signal from the system.

7. Spillover of the beta channel signal into the alpha channel shall be less than or equal to 1%.

8. Samples with count rates up to 500,000 cpm shall be measurable with less than 2% dead time loss.

9. The active diameter of the detector shall be „d 2 inches to provide approximately 2 pi coverage of the sample trays


Flow Control:
10. If a gas flow based detector is proposed, the counter shall use a standard P-10 counting gas.  Gas flow shall be monitored and controlled by the system and designed to minimize gas flow during times of inactivity and purge the chamber following a shut off.  The detector voltage shall power down automatically with a signal of low flow to prevent damage to the detector and prevent operation that could report erroneous measurement results.  A low flow indication shall be displayed visually and/or audible either via the controlling computer or the instrument.
 Physical Considerations:
11. The system shall meet performance requirements for normal laboratory environmental conditions with room temperature 15 - 32 degrees C, and relative humidity 20 - 70 percent.

12. The system shall operate on standard AC power at 115 to 125 Volts at 60 Hz.    

13. The instrument shall be self contained and semi portable.  The system shall be fully incorporated onto its own wheeled cart.  The entire counting system (including computers and output devices but not necessarily the gas bottle) shall be capable of being moved by one individual, without disassembly or technical support from the manufacturer.

14. The system shall be designed for ease of maintenance and repair.  The counting chamber and detectors shall be capable of being removed, cleaned, or replaced by NIST personnel without undue difficulty or use of specialized tools unless such tools are provided.  The detector window shall be removable for cleaning or replacement by NIST staff in the event of damage or contamination.  A replacement window shall be included with the counter system. 

15. The sample changer shall be automatic with the capability of handling at least 50 pre-loaded samples.  Each sample holder shall be sized to handle sample holders, i.e. planchettes, of 2 inches in diameter by 1/4 inch tall and shall be individually identified or coded for use in the counting system. The sample holders shall be removable, washable and replaceable without affecting the system operation.  It shall be permissible to use sample holders in any combination or sequence order.  The changer mechanism shall require minimal preventive maintenance requirements and having an expected operating life of at least ten years without major service or component replacement.  The time required to change samples and initiate the next count shall be less than 20 seconds. 

16. Control of loading, manual sample advance, reverse, or restack, start count sequence, stop count, and unloading shall be possible from a top panel touch pad, keyboard, or mouse ergonomically placed close to the sample planchets for quick loading and unloading.  The unit should also have a flat shelf space to place the smears during loading and unloading.

System Control Algorithms: 
17. Full setup and QA of the counter, input and monitoring of system parameters, gas flow control, protocol programming, sample handling commands, output templates, and data file storage shall be possible via the computer linked interface.  

18.  The interface computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and printer shall be supplied with the counter. The vendor shall also supply all required software along with backup disks of the programs for reinstallation or for installation on a replacement computer with an off the shelf unit if necessary.  (A list of all proprietary computer boards, system requirements, current costs, and replacement lead times shall be included with the documentation).

19. It shall be possible to have multiple protocols in the sample stack to allow multiple users to set up their samples and leave the system to run and automatically provide the output without further intervention. 

20. Sample count times shall be program/protocol adjustable from 0.1 to 1000 minutes.  

21. The program shall allow for repeat or sequential counting to track decay or test system stability (Chi squared tests).

22. The system shall be fully integrated with customizable programming for at least ten different sample protocols which will be selected via a sample stack loaded card.  The user and/or system manager shall be able to customize counting and sample parameters such as count time, repeat counts, efficiencies, background subtraction levels, and data output formats.

23. Protocol programming shall support simple mathematical algebraic operations to convert data output to user specified values or units. These simple operations shall include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, log, and square root functions allowing background subtraction, efficiency and unit conversions, decay corrections, and statistical analysis.  The protocol programming shall also allow for input specification of flow rates, deposition rates, or volumes for calculations when counting particulate air filters.    

24. Protocol specified output reports formats shall support units such as gross and net counts and count rates, disintegration rates as reported in disintegrations per minute, disintegrations per second, multiples of Becquerel (Bq, kBq, etc.) and multiples of Curies, (nCi, uCi, etc).  Outputs shall be capable of reporting at a minimum: Protocol Titles, Sample Identifications, User Identifications, Dates, Clock Time, Count Rates, Disintegration Rates, Sample Count Times, Minimal Detectable Activities, and Standard Deviations, and ¡§Alarm¡¨ or ¡§Contaminated¡¨ warnings. The ¡§Alarm¡¨ or ¡§Contaminated¡¨ warnings shall be based on user specified levels appropriately programmed for each protocol.  

25. The report output templates shall be user customizable.  Programming these templates shall be menu driven with on screen help and full instructions shall be provided with the documentation.  Customizing the reports shall be simple without requiring extensive programming knowledge. Output report templates shall include optional space for comments, sample descriptions, and signature blocks. Printout formats shall be capable of reporting results for at least 25 samples per page.

26. Users shall have the option or ability to input a description, user name, or other pertinent input data such as sample descriptions that will be included in the reports at the beginning of a batch counting.  Should the user choose not to input that data before counting, the report formats shall be able to include blank lines to add the information to the file after the count and to hand write this information on the hard copy print out.  

27. Real time on screen display of sample data, counting session results, system parameters, and specified analysis shall also be supported while the count is in progress.  For example when the 1st sample is completed the screen shall echo the calculated report results to the screen.  An update of the second count or count rate and count time will also be displayed either on the monitor or a separate display panel on the unit while the count is in progress.  When the second sample count is done, the monitor shall display those calculated report results below the first sample results and shall proceed to the third sample, etc.  In this way the user shall be able to track the results for the batch while the counting is in progress. 

28. Automatic hard copy report print outs for each batch of samples shall be available in all operating modes. For example it shall be possible to set the protocol for normal sample counting so that the report shall be printed automatically upon completion of the counts without requiring the user to return to the machine, select a file, then command a print.  The user shall be able to start the count, walk away, comeback later, and take the printout off the printer tray.  

29. Counting session results shall also be saved in memory so that the data can later be retrieved to generate an additional hard copy report output at a later time.   The software shall support saving the sample count results to an electronic media such as disks, CD RW, or other standard and supportable computer data transfer media.  The data files shall be retrievable, transferable, and editable as needed using common database or spread sheet software (This soft ware shall also be supplied and loaded onto the computer).  The system shall indicate when the disk memory is nearing capacity to allow the users to remove files without loss of data.

30. All operating parameters for each of the sample types (protocols)  shall be stored and available for use at any time during counting of samples with sample type identified by a built-in designed method (such as protocol cards).  A function to back up and recall all system parameters, user created/defined controls, output formats, collected data, and analysis results to removable media shall be provided either within the program or external to the program.

31. The system shall be designed to automatically recover from any power interruption and continue operations without loss of operating parameters or completed count data.  

32. Separate modes for alpha and alpha+beta measurements shall be provided and be selectable from the sample protocol batch programs.

33. Quality assurance and Quality Control shall be integrated features of the software.  The software shall include automated routines for comprehensive calibration and quality assurance determination and adjustment of all sensitive parameters.  These will include voltage plateau, threshold, and window settings, detection efficiency, detector background count rates, alpha and beta channel spillover, and efficiency/background figure of merit or similar optimization measures. Quality control parameters (back ground, Chi-squared stability, long term alpha and beta source response stability, energy efficiency, alpha window cross over, and LLD or MDA) shall be monitored and trend plots should be generated automatically and/or at the users request.  Indications of statistical deviations from set parameters shall be identified by the QC software.

.     
All interested offerors shall provide a quote for the following services:     

A. BACKGROUND INFORMATION

The US Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, (NIST), Intelligent Systems Division (ISD) of the Manufacturing Engineering Laboratory is working with the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL) to address the information security issues of computer control systems used in the industrial process control industries.  Specifically, NIST is leading the Process Control Security Requirements Forum (PCSRF).  The PCSRF is a working group of users, vendors, and integrators in the industrial process control industry which is addressing the cyber security requirements for new industrial process control systems and components, including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, Distributed Control Systems (DCS), Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), and Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs).  The 650 members of the PCSRF represent the critical infrastructures and related industrial process industries, including oil and gas, water, electric power, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, metals and mining, and pulp and paper.

In order to define reasonable IT security requirements and weigh the costs and benefits of adding new security features, it is necessary to understand 1) the vulnerabilities, threats, and their associated risks for these systems, 2) the effectiveness of different security technologies and procedures, and 3) the performance impacts and other costs that result from implementing those technologies and procedures.  Real-time computer systems used in industrial process control applications have many characteristics that are different than traditional information processing system used in business applications. Foremost among these is design for efficiency, time-critical response and safety. Security has generally not been a strong design driver and therefore tended to be bypassed in favor of performance and safety.
 
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems integrate data acquisition systems with data transmission systems and Human-Machine Interface (HMI) software in order to provide a centralized monitor and control system for numerous process inputs and outputs.  SCADA systems are designed to collect information, transfer it back to a central computer, and display the information to the operator(s) graphically or textually, thereby allowing the operator to monitor and/or control an entire system from a central location in real time. Based on the sophistication and setup of the individual system, control of any individual system, operation, or task can be automatic, or it can be initiated by operator commands.
SCADA systems consist of both hardware and software and are used to control dispersed assets where centralized data acquisition is as important as control such as in the distribution operations of water supply systems, oil/gas pipelines, electrical systems and rail systems.  Typical hardware includes a Master Terminal Unit (MTU) placed at a central location, communications equipment (radio, telephone line, cable or satellite), and one or more geographically distributed remote stations consisting of either a Remote Terminal Unit (RTU), a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) which controls actuators and/or monitors sensors, or Intelligent Electronic Device (IED), such as a protective relay.  These geographically distributed remote stations (RTUs, PLCs and IEDs) will hereby be called “field devices” throughout the remainder of this document.  The MTU stores and processes the information from field device inputs and outputs, while the field device controls the local process. The communications hardware allows the transfer of information and data back and forth between the MTU and the field devices. The software is programmed to tell the system what and when to monitor, what parameter ranges are acceptable, and what response to initiate should the parameters go outside acceptable values.

Most current SCADA field devices are highly insecure because encryption, authentication, and other security measures were not designed into the devices. An adversary could potentially exploit these insecurities by inserting false commands and responses, modifying legitimate communication, or altering field device behavior. 

Common vulnerabilities in SCADA field devices include (but are not limited to):
•	IP-addressable using TCP/IP
•	Authentication is usually weak or nonexistent
•	Remote configuration capabilities and modem access
•	FTP, TElnet, SNMP and HTML ports open to allow for remote configuration
•	Configuration modes that are protected by password, but most are sent in clear text
•	Unencrypted communications with SCADA MTU
•	Configurations are not stored or backed up
•	Embedded web servers
•	Default OS security configurations
•	System logs are neither collected nor examined

Security capabilities don’t exist in SCADA field devices largely because appropriate security solutions are not available.  Vendors have not had a business case for developing SCADA field devices with security capabilities.  This is why there is a need for a SCADA Field Device Protection Profile (PP).  Concise functional and assurance security requirements need to be specified for new SCADA field devices so that the requirements can get into the product design cycle and the vendors have specific security requirements to build to.

B. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT

The overall program objective is to reduce the vulnerability of industrial process control systems used in key industries of the Nation’s Critical Infrastructure. This procurement is to acquire services to define the information security functional and assurance requirements for new SCADA field devices and to capture the requirements as a Protection Profile utilizing the Common Criteria.  The SCADA Field Device PP shall be complete and capable of having a Security Target written against it and be capable of testing and evaluation, leading to certified products by accredited IT security test laboratories.  These security requirements could be specified in procurement Request for Proposals (RFPs) for new field devices used in SCADA systems.  There is no intent to suggest or imply that the Government will enforce the adaptation of these requirements.

C.  CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS

The contractor shall perform all tasks listed below, utilizing the Common Criteria to develop a Protection Profile for new Field Devices used in SCADA systems.  The SCADA Field Device PP must be complete and be capable of leading to certified products.  The contractor must have specific knowledge of SCADA systems and their unique security requirements.

DESCRIPTION/SOW:     FIRE/SAFETY WARNING SYSTEM This project is to install and/or upgrade fire alarm system at the Fort Chaffee Maneuver Training Center (FCMTC).  Each listed facility will have fire/smoke detection units, manual alarms, local enunciation/warning devices and system control panel.  Specif ied facilities will also include CO2 detection/alarm.   Vendors will be provided an opportunity to access site and perform evaluation prior to submitting a proposal.  The vendor will evaluate the current system to identify which existing components are salvageable, reusable or upgradeable and will be retained.  The vendor will ensure retained components are compatible with new system control panels to be installed.  All detection and warning devices will, at a minimum, meet NFPA Code. The new system is to have the capacity for expansion without replacing equipment or components. Expansion capabilities are to include, but are not limited to, intrusion detection, access control, personnel alerting (mass notification,) and energy managemen t control.  The new control panels will be low voltage, automatic, integrated, telecommunication-compatible units.  Each control panel will, at a minimum: "	Have the capacity to monitor 60 zones.  "	Have two class A or four class B (switch selectable) zones, and two auxiliary zones.  Zones may be added in increments with zone expansion cards.  "	Panels are to have the capacity to plug in auxiliary output cards that can provide eight programmable outputs.  The vendor will provide system operation/maintenance training for up to four (4) FCMTC personnel, troubleshooting/repair manuals and any access codes required for system maintenance.  Vendor will not have proprietary locks or codes which force exclusive se rvice contracts for future servicing.  System will be warranted one (1) year from contract completion for labor and equipment. General breakdown of requirements per building: "	Remove existing fire alarm control panel, area smoke detectors and alarm bells. "	Install new alarm control panel. Connect to existing electrical panel (120V a/c power). "	Remove existing heat detectors and manual pull stations. Check for proper operation. These devices are to be reused if compatible, functional and replaced if defective. "	Check all existing wiring for defects, may reuse if serviceable and in accordance with code. Repair/replace as required.  Existing raceway/wiring is to be reused where possi ble.  Where new wiring is required, it will consist of approved fire alarm cable.  Cable will be run above dropped ceilings and other like areas where practical.  If cable must be installed in exposed areas, it will be run in conduit raceway.  Existing wir ing not reused will be disconnected from power source and abandoned in place.  "	Install new area smoke detectors. The existing interior bell type audible alarms are to be removed and replaced with horn/strobe audible alarms. Horns are to have a 3-tone temporal mode. Install components in existing locations if acceptable. Relocate if  required to comply with NFPA code  "	Reinstall functional heat detectors and manual stations. All detectors, manual stations, panels and other existing components that are not usable or compatible are to be disposed of by the contractor. "	Connect the existing duct detectors to the new system. (This presumes that the existing duct detectors have auxiliary unused alarm contacts available for connection). In buildings where no duct detectors exist or where existing duct detectors are incompa tible, install new. "	Every device is to be tested for proper operation and reporting capabilities. Provide written test report. "	Locally powered single station units are to be replaced with equal quantities and in same locations if acceptable. Relocate or install additional as required to comply with NFPA code. All components are to be powered by the new control panel and connecte d such that operation of the smoke detector will sound the local internal audible while operation of the associated heat detector will activate the fire alarm panel. Where no other alarm notification exists, the units will also be connected so that all int ernal audible devices will activate on general alarm. "	Although all tested, functional, low voltage heat detectors and pull stations are to be reinstalled, existing panel operated smoke detectors are to be replaced with units compatible with the new fire alarm panels. This is required due to the extended age  and voltage requirements of the existing units. All battery operated smoke detectors are to be replaced and wiring will be installed and connected to the new panel. "	All initiation and notification circuits will be connected NFPA Style B as is consistent with existing systems. "	All buildings listed in the Barracks section and all buildings listed in the Billeting section that have gas supplied heat are to have CO2 sensors installed. The CO2 sensors are to be mounted on the return duct with a remote probe implanted into the duct . The sensors are to be electronically controlled. A new circuit will be required for powering the sensor. Buildings that do not already have a smoke detector on the return duct will require a combination CO2 /smoke detector installed with accompanying ele ctric circuit.

<DESC>Leaf-off LiDAR Data Acquisition and Processing- provide aircraft services to collect data with a LiDAR Instrument(Optech 3100) 
There are two bid items for this project.  

BID ITEM 1
The spatial extent of the study area will be all land contained within a 200 meter outside perimeter buffer in the study area.  This study area includes the watersheds of: Johnson Creek; Big Elk Creek, Middle Big Elk Creek; Feagles Creek; Rail Creek; Cougar Creek; Beaver Dam Creek; Baker Creek; and Sugarbowl Creek of the Coastal Range of Oregon.

All remotely–sensed data shall be acquired between October 15th and November 20th, 2005. The exact data acquisition dates within the specified period will be agreed upon, prior to the data acquisition mission, by the Forest Service (FS) and the contractor, based on forest senescence seasonality and weather.

The Contractor will: 
	Obtain LiDAR data for the study area using an Optech 3100 instrument

Specifications of LiDAR data:
	Return Density:	Minimum of 4 per square meter
	Mean beam spacing:	Maximum of 0.50 meters both along and cross track
	Beam divergence:	0.3mRad 
	Flight swath sidelap:	50%

Deliverables:
All final products shall be delivered on portable hard drive(s) with USB-2 connectivity.  All digital data and the portable hard drives will become property of the FS.  All digital data shall be in ASCII or Arc/INFO grid or coverage format in the projection parameters stated below.  All coordinate, LiDAR return intensity, and DEM values shall have a minimum of two-digit precision.

All spatial data shall be in Arc/INFO coverage or GRID format with the following projection parameters:
	Projection: 	UTM
	Datum:	NAD27
	Units:	Meters
	Zone:	10

All X, Y coordinate data shall be in the above described UTM projection.

1) LiDAR data in one ASCII file containing the following information:
-	Unique ID identifier
-	X, Y, and Z coordinates (in UTM zone 10 projection parameters)
-	Return beam intensity
-	Return beam identifier (1-4 with ground return always designated as “4”)
-	Forward scan angle
-	Side scan angle

2) Orthorectified Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Arc/INFO grid format with cell size equal to the resolution of the coarser multispectral data set (0.8 – 1.0 meter), generated by processing LiDAR ground returns, and using value cells only for the portion of the area where such returns are available.
3) Orthorectified Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in Arc/INFO grid format with cell size equal to the resolution of the coarser multispectral data set (0.8 – 1.0 meter) resulting from processing Deliverable #2 to obtain interpolated values for cells without ground LIDAR returns.
4) Orthorectified Vegetation surface model (VSM) (similar to a DEM except the surface is the vegetation canopy, not the earth’s surface), of equal cell size to Deliverable #2 and #3 above, and co-registered with the DEMs generated in Deliverable #2 and #3 above resulting from processing the LiDAR first returns.  (NOTE: This will allow the FS to create a vegetation height data layer for the study area by subtracting the values in Deliverable #3 from Deliverable #4)
5) Arc/INFO coverage containing the flight lines used to obtain the LiDAR data.


 ITEM 2 
Overview: 
Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data acquisition is proposed for a ~42,591 acre area of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest near Ashland, OR. The objective of the project is to map forest and vegetation stand structure in the forest and to provide an accurate ground model.  To be compatible with previous data collected, the contractor is required to use the Optech 3100 LiDAR system, which is capable of high laser pulse repetition rates (33 to 100k Hz), resulting in sub-meter ground spot spacing. Dense spot spacing provides better penetration of vegetation and detailed mapping of terrain topography. In addition, the system records four range measurements per pulse (first, second, third, and last), allowing for the differentiation of forest canopy from the bare ground, understory and vegetation density derivation. The LiDAR system is integrated with a high resolution Applanix DSS digital camera that can be filtered for either true color or near infrared images. Details of the instrumentation are included in Attachment A. 
Data Collection: 
Flight plans are optimized to cover the entire project area. In forestry applications, the goal is to maintain a scan angle of no more than 15o from nadir. The narrow scan angle minimizes laser shadowing from vegetation and increases the probability of ground returns. 
Figure 1 illustrates the target LiDAR area with proposed flight lines for average ground spot spacing of 74 cm. The system has both wide (0.3 mR) and narrow (0.7 mR) beam divergences settings. The narrow beam divergence is recommended in mountainous terrain with heavy canopy. Cost estimates are provided for different point densities in the table below. 
Schedule: 
The flight will take place during leaf-on conditions. If photos are requested, the optimum flight window is mid-June to late July, 2006 due to higher sun angles.  
_____________________________________________________________________________________ 
Specifications for Deliverables: 
Sensor: LiDAR - Optech 3100 
Standard Deliverables: One-meter digital elevation model (DEM). 
Geocorrected data for all un-gridded return signals. 
Surface intensity image. 
Survey report that includes all LiDAR mission parameters 
Specifications: Beam Divergence = 0.3 mR (Narrow) or 0.7 mR (Wide) 
Scan Angle less than ±15o off nadir 
Side Overlap: ~50% 
Average Point Density: 3.2 points/meter squared 
Sensor: Digital True Color or Near Infrared Digital Photos (Optional) 
Standard Deliverables: GIS compatible Orthorectified digital air-photos. 
Specifications: Spatial resolution: <= 30 cm. 
Spectral: True Color: (blue, green, red) OR 
Color IR: (green, red, near infrared) 
Side Overlap: ~50% 
Accuracy: <= 2meter RMSE.  
Notes: 
• The average point density considers the side overlap between flight lines. 
• Experience has shown that using 50% overlap between flight lines significantly reduces laser shadowing in forested environments. 
 
________________________________________________________________________
Attachment A - INSTRUMENTATION 
The Optech 3100 LiDAR system is comprised of a sensor and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). LiDAR data can be collected with a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of up to 100kHz (i.e., 100,000 laser pulses per second), with lower PRF settings spanning 33-71kHz. The inertial measurement unit includes a GPS receiver that streams data from the IMU, stored independently during the flight (and differentially corrected and integrated with LiDAR pulse data during post processing). The data collection system can record all returns at the highest PRF(s) with no truncation errors (i.e. full throughput). The LIDAR system is mounted in the belly of the airplane and calibrated per manufacturer’s specification, and is also independently tested by the Contractor for internal consistency. 
The system records four range measurements per pulse (first, second, third, and last), allowing for differentiation of forest canopy from the bare ground, understory and vegetation density derivation. Return intensities are also recorded, which allows for the creation of a surface intensity image (also known as a combined elevation model ~ CEM). The intensity image provides a measurement of the surface reflectivity. In forestry applications, return intensities are often used to differentiate between hardwoods, conifers, snags, diseased/dying trees, etc. 

Figure A-1 – Raw LiDAR Return Points. 
During the flight, the pilots use a heads-up navigation display to accurately track and maintain each flight line. The sensor operator monitors the data collection on a graphical display that ‘paints’ the ground with real-time swath (coverage) and range (altitude above ground) as the LiDAR points are acquired. The instrumentation and in-flight procedures ensure that the study area is covered with no discontinuities or gaps.  
_______________________________________________________________________
The LiDAR system is fully integrated with an Applanix DSS Model 301 digital multi-spectral camera with a 16 mega-pixel detector array. The camera is housed in the aircraft sensor bay on a stabilized mount that is designed to hold geometric accuracy in operational environments to within one pixel. The integration of the two sensors with the same GPS/IMU is specifically designed for seamless image registration to the LiDAR data. The camera has a field of view of 37o and has a single Bayer detector array, so band registration errors are not applicable. 
The camera stores imagery in three bands that can be filtered to present either color (visible band) or near infrared (color infrared) imagery (Figure A-2). Band centers for the color infrared images are 555nm (green), 660nm (red), and 820 nm (near infrared). The images are stored in a native 12-bit format and the full radiometric resolution can be maintained through the ortho-rectification process.

Ground Support/Quality Control 
During acquisition, a minimum of two dual frequency DGPS base stations recording at 1–second epochs will be utilized. These stations will be established on control points surveyed to CORS96 or HARN datum within or near the project area. Maximum baseline lengths between control points and airborne GPS will not exceed 30 kilometers (18 miles). 
Quality control data will be collected within the project area using a ground-based real-time kinematic survey, also linked to the DGPS base stations and collected with rovers. The rover units receive real-time position corrections from the base stations and can efficiently collect any number of ground control points within the project area (300 or more points surveyed across multiple flight lines). Quality control data are then compared to the processed LiDAR data to ensure minimum accuracies across the project area during post processing, and will be reported with metadata. An absolute RMSE will be calculated for the entire study.

52.212-1 -- Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items.
As prescribed in 12.301(b)(1), insert the following provision:
Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jan 2005)
(a) North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code and small business size standard. The NAICS code and small business size standard for this acquisition appear in Block 10 of the solicitation cover sheet (SF 1449). However, the small business size standard for a concern which submits an offer in its own name, but which proposes to furnish an item which it did not itself manufacture, is 500 employees.
(b) Submission of offers. Submit signed and dated offers to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Offers may be submitted on the SF 1449, letterhead stationery, or as otherwise specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, offers must show --
(1) The solicitation number;
(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of offers;
(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the offeror;
(4) A technical description of the items being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation. This may include product literature, or other documents, if necessary;
(5) Terms of any express warranty;
(6) Price and any discount terms;
(7) “Remit to” address, if different than mailing address;
(8) A completed copy of the representations and certifications at FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(j) for those representations and certifications that the offeror shall complete electronically);
(9) Acknowledgment of Solicitation Amendments;
(10) Past performance information, when included as an evaluation factor, to include recent and relevant contracts for the same or similar items and other references (including contract numbers, points of contact with telephone numbers and other relevant information); and
(11) If the offer is not submitted on the SF 1449, include a statement specifying the extent of agreement with all terms, conditions, and provisions included in the solicitation. Offers that fail to furnish required representations or information, or reject the terms and conditions of the solicitation may be excluded from consideration.
(c) Period for acceptance of offers. The offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 30 calendar days from the date specified for receipt of offers, unless another time period is specified in an addendum to the solicitation.
(d) Product samples. When required by the solicitation, product samples shall be submitted at or prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. Unless otherwise specified in this solicitation, these samples shall be submitted at no expense to the Government, and returned at the sender’s request and expense, unless they are destroyed during preaward testing.
(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.
(f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers. 
(1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.
(2)
(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is “late” and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and—
(A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or
(B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government’s control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or
(C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.
(ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers. An offer may be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of offers, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and the person signs a receipt for the offer.
(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror’s initial offer should contain the offeror’s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.
(h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified. The Government reserves the right to make an award on any item for a quantity less than the quantity offered, at the unit prices offered, unless the offeror specifies otherwise in the offer.

The following  factors shall be used to evaluate offers:   (i)	The technical capability of the item(s) offered to meet the Government requirement as described above.  Offers will be evaluated to determine if the product(s) offered meet or exceed each of the minimum specifications identified above.  Each line item will be evaluated separately.  Offers shall include sufficient technical documentation regarding the specifications of the offered product(s) for the Government to determine if all the minimum requirements stated above are met or exceeded.  Offerors may su bmit a quote for one, two or all three line items.  Offers shall specifically identify which contract line item (0001, 0002 or 0003) any product offered is in response to.   (ii)	Price.  The Government intends to award a contract, or contracts, for the lowest-priced items meeting all the stated minimum requirements.    Price will be the critical factor in determining which technically acceptable offer will be the awardee.  Con versely, for any product offered that does not meet the stated minimum specifications, price is irrelevant. (iii)	Past performance.  Offers shall include evidence of identical or very similar items having been sold in the past. Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  If an offer includes a product that does not meet each of the stated minimum specifications, that offer will not be further evaluated or considered for award for t hat line item.  For each line item; among offers that meet all of the minimum technical requirements; award will be made to that offeror with the lowest proposed fixed price.  If an offer does not include a quote for one or two of the line items, it will s till be considered for the line item(s) quoted.  If an offer is determined to be not technically acceptable (i.e., not meeting all the stated minimum specifications) for one or two line items, it will still be considered for the line item(s) that were dete rmined to be technically acceptable.    (x)	Offerors shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, and DFARS 252.212-7000, Offeror Representations and Certifications -Commercial Items, with its offer.
