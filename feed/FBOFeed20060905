<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE:  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announces its intention to negotiate a sole source follow-on contract with Cerner Corporation to augment research, data collection and other related activities among a cohort of HIV –infected persons receiving care at 15 HIV –specialty ambulatory clinics in several United States cities.  The anticipated performance period is five years.  The contractor will be required to continue to collect and assure the quality of data collected from HIV care sites—notably, the patients’ demographics, social and behavioral characteristics, physical signs and symptoms, medical diagnoses, treatments, laboratory values, and will propose and execute at least two sub-studies within the framework of such data collection.  The sub-studies shall include clinical, epidemiologic, laboratory, and social-behavioral issues in HIV infection.  Specifically, the Contractor shall perform the following tasks in this project:   

TASK 1: Data Abstraction and Entry from 15 study-sites treating HIV –infected adult patients (at least 75 patients per study site per year).  The Contractor shall collect and assure the quality of data collected from the HIV study sites within the data management system.  These activities shall include database entry of patient visit information within the study sites’ protocol and patient consent.  

TASK 2:  The data shall be entered into the Clinical Practice Analyst (CPA), and the contractor shall provide technical support for the CPA and modify the software as requested by CDC.  

TASK 3:  Provide and assure the completeness and accuracy of data by data-management training for on-site personnel to each study site and site visit to assure the timely, complete and accurate addition of data to the overall database; and ongoing quality assurance-driven data management.  


TASK 4:  The Contractor shall ensure all study sites maintain their local IRB approvals with annual renewals.  All approvals and final clearances (CDC and local IRB’s, FWA’s and other applicable requirements) must be obtained for the protocol acquired under TASK 1 above.  

TASK 5: Conduct and execute at least two sub-studies relevant to the prevention and treatment of HIV infection within the cohort of enrolled patients to address issues that emerge during the course of the study and as a result of the evolving knowledge about HIV/AIDS. These issues may include mortality and morbidity of HIV infection in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), treatment and prevention of opportunistic illnesses, and the treatment and prevention of complications related to the use of HAART and attendant longer survival.  The sub-studies shall include clinical, epidemiologic, laboratory and social-behavioral issues in HIV infection

TASK 6:  Organize and execute a two-day annual meeting for this project.  Participants will include CDC staff, Contractor’s staff, investigators, and others from study sites.

TASK 7:   The Contactor shall provide statistical support for at least eight new and separate scientific analyses of the data.  Analyses will be conducted in consultation with and under the guidance of CDC.  All presentations and publications from data analyses under the contract will be restricted. 

Cerner Corporation’s long-term experience with this study will help ensure the most efficient implementation of this project for the following reasons:

a)	Cerner Corporation has worked on this project for 13 years and is already intimately familiar with the study sites, agency’s requirements, and past and ongoing information on the “existing” cohort of patients.
b)	Cerner Corporation‘s past participation and continued partnerships are critical for resolving ongoing resolutions and/or remediation.
c)	Time constraints imposed by CDC for target patients’ group data, publications, site monitoring and reporting, require Cerner Corporation’s continued work on this project.  Cerner Corporation’s experience and history with the project will ensure timely reporting and meeting CDC’s requirements. 

It is critical to the study to continue to collect longitudinal, ongoing information on the “existing” cohort of patients from the original source than to any other source which would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling CDC’s requirement.  Hence, a follow-on contract with Cerner Corporation would be the most efficient and cost effective way to deliver services that are critical and essential to meet CDC’s requirement.   CDC intends to negotiate this requirement with Cerner Corporation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, HHSAR 306.302-1, and 10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1).  Any other responsible sources may submit a statement of qualifications and experience which, if timely received, will be evaluated by CDC to determine if a competitive solicitation should be issued.  Responses must be received on May 16, 2006, at 4 PM, Eastern Standard Time (EST).  Collect calls will not be accepted.  Responses may be E-mailed to Betty Vannoy at bbv9@cdc.gov.  Questions concerning this proposed acquisition may be directed to Betty Vannoy, Contract Specialist.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>As part of its biodefense research mission, the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  announces a program to support a systems biology analysis of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection, vaccination, or immunotherapy, with a focus on NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens (listed at http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm). Immunological research that is not directed specifically at one or more NIAID Category A, B, or C priority pathogen or their products is responsive only if the research: 1) addresses a practical approach to inducing, controlling or improving the effectiveness of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection by those pathogens or vaccines or immunotherapies to prevent them; and 2) includes validation studies with at least one NIAID Category A, B or C priority pathogen to confirm the importance of the immunological pathway in protection of the host from, or clearance of that pathogen. 

The goal of this program is to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of innate and adaptive immune responses to bacteria and viruses or host responses to vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these pathogens, using a systems biology approach.  Knowledge gained from these studies will advance our understanding of the delicate balance required to induce protective immunity against infectious agents, in particular NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens, without accompanying immune-mediated damage to the individual.

The systems biology analysis shall be based on high-throughput screens of existing or novel mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes, supported by detailed genomics, proteomics, computational biology, and bioinformatics approaches to determine the gene products’ functions in innate and/or adaptive immunity to infection with, or vaccination or immunotherapy against, NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens. 

The systems biology analysis shall include:

(1) High-throughput screens of mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes. Forward genetic approaches are preferred for the generation of novel mouse models or study of existing models, since genes can be identified in the absence of a detailed knowledge of the genetic regulation of an observed phenotype. Some recommended genetics approaches include random mutagenesis using ethylnitrosourea (ENU), or large-scale analysis of recombinant inbred strains or congenic animals.  More targeted high-throughput methods (e.g., high-throughput generation of targeted Knock-outs, Knock-ins, or deletion mutations) may be utilized with adequate justification of the benefits these approaches bring to large-scale identification of novel immune response genes; and 

(2) Human correlation studies for analysis of a subset of immune regulatory genes, identified in the mouse studies, in human cell or tissue samples. While human cell lines may be used in initial screens, results shall be validated in primary human cell lines or tissues.  The analyses shall be designed to determine whether the immune response genes identified in the mouse function similarly in human immune cells. 

This RFP will be available electronically on/about June 30, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.     This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.     No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The National Park Service anticipates issuing a Prospectus for the operation of guided horseback rides at Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming.  The Prospectus is expected to be released during the "off" season, when the trails related to the opportunity may be difficult to access due to snowfall.  Site visits will be available by appointment until October 1, 2006.  Because only a portion of the business is within Grand Teton National Park boundaries, this prospectus will only authorize use of specified trails within the park.  Interested parties must contact Dave Rhinehart at 307-739-3414 or by email at Dave_Rhinehart@nps.gov or Mallory Smith at 307-739-3434 or by e-mail at Mallory_Smith@nps.gov by the close of business on September 25, 2006. A site visit is not required to submit a proposal for the Prospectus, but is encouraged.  No questions specific to the Prospectus will be entertained during the site visit. Questions specific to the Prospectus will be answered after the Prospectus is issued. The site visit will view existing concession trails and address questions about the existing Concession Contract. The guided horseback rides generally operate from mid May to late September. The annual gross receipts for the in-park portion of this Concession Contract averaged $83,502 from 2002 to 2005.

This feature should delay the heat cycle until selected work thermocouples are within a preset deviation band with respect to the furnace control thermocouple.  Activation of this event causes the system to "hold" until all of the pre-selected work thermocouples are within a set deviation band. 8.17 SAFETY & INTERLOCK DESIGN „« To avoid damage to the furnace system, the electrical control system should incorporate a sequencing protection feature in its design. „« All vacuum valves should close and all pumps and motors should de-energize should a power failure occur with manual re-started upon restoration of power. „« Should loss of cooling water occur, the hot zone and diffusion pump will be automatically de-energized. 9.0 TEST PROGRAM 9.1 The manufacturer will perform complete factory testing of the equipment. All tests will be recorded and results provided to us.  Included in the furnace check-out procedure are: „« Electrical cabinet and component check „« Furnace leak check „« Ultimate vacuum pressure „« Operation of pumping system including valves „« Operation of gas system including valves „« Safety interlock systems and alarm functions „« Recording of serial numbers from the vacuum pumps and gas blower „« All functions activated by the programmer and all other vacuum components will be tested. „« In addition to the above test criteria the manufacture will run a complete cycle and provide full vacuum, leak rate and temperature performance and report these results in light of the requirements.  Work thermocouples can be refrasil insulated Type "K".  Temperature uniformity testing can be limited to 2100¢X F due to limitations of the Type "K" work thermocouple. „« Backill and partial pressure system operation will be performed including cooling rate and these results will be reported in light of the requirements. „« General training on the operation of the equipment should also be included. This purchase order is being issued to Solar Atmosphere Manufacturing Inc because the NETL Albany needs to purchase a horizontal loading vacuum furnace to support its Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Project and its Advanced Research Program projects.  The Solar Model Solar Manufacturing Model HFL-2624-EQ vacuum heat treating furnace is the only furnace that is designed with graphite heating elements mounted cylindrically in the hot zone and divided into multiple trim zones and segments for ease of replacement of element replacement.  This is a great cost saving advantage preventing the total element replacement by allowing for replacement of just the localized failed area.  More importantly the heating elements supports are designed in such a way to shield the ceramic insulators from the build up of metal plating that can cause arcing and shorts because these designs are covered by three Solar-held patents.  This is a critical aspect of the vacuum furnace design that makes the Solar furnace much safer.  In the past other furnaces at the site have failed because of metal build up around the base of the heating elements causing a dangerous short which is unsafe and very expensive to repair.  The Solar design protects against this occurrence. All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by this agency.  All interested firms must respond to DE-RQ26-06NT00914.  Offerors shall provide sufficient technical literature, documents, etc., in order for the Government evaluation team to make an adequate technical assessment of the quote as meeting technical acceptability. Therefore, no solicitation will result with this announcement.  This award shall be made using FAR 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The North American Industry Classification (NAIC) is 339111.  Request for information should be addressed to Mr. Robert L. Mohn, FAX 412-386-5770.  The Technical Representative for the above requirement is Mr. Paul Turner, PHONE 541-967-5863.  All bids, proposals, or quotations must be submitted by 5:00 PM Eastern Time, September 20, 2006.

<CONTACT>Susan Slivinski, 937-257-6146 ext. 4216
<DESC>IMAGING FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROMETER.   This announcement constitutes a Notice of Proposed Contract Action in accordance with FAR  5.203(a). The Government intends to issue a Request for Proprosal (RFP)  for the acquisition of one (1) each Fast Scanning, Imaging (staring, non  scanning) Fourier Transform Spectrometer in the mid-infrared range with  high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution.   Spectrometer will be  used in faculty and student research such as remote sensing of battlefield  conditions and bomb phenomenology research.  The Air Force is developing a  database for Infrared (IR) signatures to be used in a variety of  applications.  Knowledge of the IR signatures is essential to determine  battlefield operations.  This data base can only be built through the use  of an Imaging Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer.  This instrument  will find several key military applications including: (1) the  classification of battlespace detonations, including bomb detonations,  muzzle flash, and missile launches, (2) plume monitoring for chemical and  biological agent detection, and (3) fast framing, hyperspectral imaging  applications.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 334516.  The  acquisition will be conducted under full and open competition.  The  ESTIMATED solicitation issue date is 24 January 2006.  All information  will be posted at the following web address:  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/.  No telephone, written or fax requests from  a requester will be accepted; documents must be downloaded from the  Internet. All interested offerors are encouraged to register to receive  e-mail notification of PIXS updates.  For more information on "IMAGING FOURIER TRANSFORM INFRARED SPECTROMETER",  please refer to:  http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil/pixs_solicitation.asp?id=4228

In these capacities, responsibilities of the Coordinator include programmatic planning and coordination of drug abuse research on womens health and sex/gender differences; promoting and facilitating high-quality research applications in this area; information sharing within the Institute and among ICs; responding to inquiries from DHHS, the NIH Office of Research on Womens Health, the scientific research community, and the public; dissemination of research findings to the research community and to the public; and liaison activities with professional organizations.  Activities to be conducted include the following: Use NIH grants databases including CRISP, Quick View and QVR, as well as Reference Manager to complete and maintain a database of NIDA-awarded grants dealing with women and sex/gender differences. Use the NIH library utilities including PubMed, PsychInfo, Online Journals, and Porpoise to identify and compile drug abuse research articles dealing with women, gender differences and drug abuse. Prepare reviews of NIDA-supported research published during years 2005-2006 on women and sex/gender differences in various NIDA-wide areas of research including basic human and animal laboratory research,  adolescence, HIV/AIDS, prevention and treatment. Using data from national surveys such as the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and Monitoring the Future, construct graphs for PowerPoint presentation showing sex differences in drug abuse.  
Other literature review and PowerPoint presentations as needed.
The priority and due dates of the activities will be determined by the Women & Gender Research Coordinator.  Specific due dates within each project are subject to change depending upon changing opportunities and priorities within the Women and Sex/Gender Differences Program. Ms. Charlery has been actively engaged in most of activities described above and is currently available to continue these activities.  Because she is trained in these activities, her continuation in these activities will prevent loss of progress that would occur if a new contractor were hired.  Hiring a new person would require a long training period and consequent down time on these projects as well as considerable training effort by the Women & Gender Research Coordinator, thus taking her away from other obligations.  Therefore, awarding the contract to Ms. Charlery will be cost effective for the government so as to avoid unnecessary training delays and to ensure timely and efficient completion of these tasks.  In addition, Ms. Charlery is uniquely qualified given her background and expertise in areas related to the tasks described above.  She received a Bachelor?s Degree in Psychology with an emphasis in psychobiology in May 2006, she has laboratory experience with both humans and animals, and she has experience in data collection, analysis and evaluation, as well as presentation of research at a major regional psychology conference.  She has served as a developmental neurobiology research intern conducting immunohistochemical assays on incubated chick brains, and in research with humans, she conducted behavioral assessments on adolescent participants in drug abuse research.  Further, she has the necessary software and NIH database expertise.  She is experienced in the use of Excel, PowerPoint, Reference Manager and NIH Library utilities including PubMed, PsychInfo, Online Journals, and Porpoise.  And she has rexperience in the use of NIH grants databases including CRISP, Quick View and QVR.  This Notice is a not a Request for Quote. Interested parties may identify their interest to this requirement in writing by the posting end date [box#2] of this notice.

<DESC>Air Force Distributed Common Ground System (AF DCGS) is a net-centric Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) weapon system (WS), capable of tasking ISR sensors and receiving, processing, exploiting, and disseminating data/information from airborne, national, and commercial reconnaissance platforms and sensors such as the U-2, Global Hawk, and Predator. AF DCGS performs global multi-INT operations and correlates collected Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT). This WS consists of numerous active duty, Air National Guard, and mission-partner sites interconnected by the Global Information Grid (GIG). AF DCGS Increment 2 is the next major acquisition activity building upon the architectural framework established by AF DCGS Block 10.2. Increment 2 will modernize Signals Intelligence capabilities, integrating it into AF DCGS net-centric environment as well as provide new and enhanced capabilities and continuing IMINT and MASINT updates. AF DCGS WS capabilities will be expanded to handle an increased number of existing, upgraded, and new sensors with improved communications and processing/ exploitation timelines. Current planning is for these capabilities to be developed and fielded through several versions, with each version providing a capability that is affordable, militarily useful, and based on a mature technology. Delivery of Increment capabilities will be primarily based on user priorities and the availability of mature technologies. Please check back on HERBB for future updates and more information when it becomes available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NOTE:  RESPONSE DATE CHANGED TO OCTOBER 31, 2006

As part of its biodefense research mission, the Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),  announces a program to support a systems biology analysis of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection, vaccination, or immunotherapy, with a focus on NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens (listed at http://www2.niaid.nih.gov/biodefense/bandc_priority.htm). Immunological research that is not directed specifically at one or more NIAID Category A, B, or C priority pathogen or their products is responsive only if the research: 1) addresses a practical approach to inducing, controlling or improving the effectiveness of innate and/or adaptive immune responses to infection by those pathogens or vaccines or immunotherapies to prevent them; and 2) includes validation studies with at least one NIAID Category A, B or C priority pathogen to confirm the importance of the immunological pathway in protection of the host from, or clearance of that pathogen. 

The goal of this program is to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of innate and adaptive immune responses to bacteria and viruses or host responses to vaccines and immunotherapeutics against these pathogens, using a systems biology approach.  Knowledge gained from these studies will advance our understanding of the delicate balance required to induce protective immunity against infectious agents, in particular NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens, without accompanying immune-mediated damage to the individual.

The systems biology analysis shall be based on high-throughput screens of existing or novel mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes, supported by detailed genomics, proteomics, computational biology, and bioinformatics approaches to determine the gene products’ functions in innate and/or adaptive immunity to infection with, or vaccination or immunotherapy against, NIAID Category A, B, and C priority pathogens. 

The systems biology analysis shall include:

(1) High-throughput screens of mouse models for identification of key regulatory immune response genes. Forward genetic approaches are preferred for the generation of novel mouse models or study of existing models, since genes can be identified in the absence of a detailed knowledge of the genetic regulation of an observed phenotype. Some recommended genetics approaches include random mutagenesis using ethylnitrosourea (ENU), or large-scale analysis of recombinant inbred strains or congenic animals.  More targeted high-throughput methods (e.g., high-throughput generation of targeted Knock-outs, Knock-ins, or deletion mutations) may be utilized with adequate justification of the benefits these approaches bring to large-scale identification of novel immune response genes; and 

(2) Human correlation studies for analysis of a subset of immune regulatory genes, identified in the mouse studies, in human cell or tissue samples. While human cell lines may be used in initial screens, results shall be validated in primary human cell lines or tissues.  The analyses shall be designed to determine whether the immune response genes identified in the mouse function similarly in human immune cells. 

This RFP will be available electronically on/about June 30, 2006, and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps and the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the agency.     This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.     No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-wide Numbered Note 26.

This announcement is published as a Total Small Business Set-Aside action per FAR 52.219-1 and 52.219-6 (this means you must be a small business, quoting the product of a small-business manufacturer); all eligible, responsible sources may submit an offer.  This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with FAR 13 and the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  Solicitation number / RFQ N00244-06-R-0057 applies; an electronic copy of the RFQ can be accessed at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-12 (8/4/06) and DFAR Change Notices effective through 8/14/06.  The standard industrial code is 1711 (NAICS 238220) and the business size standard is $13million.   The agency need is for a contract to provide boiler feedwater services to Naval ships in the San Diego Metro area bases.  The contract will be for a base year and four one-year options.  The statement of work is as follows:  Boiler Feedwater Services 1.1	Each delivery of boiler feedwater shall be accompanied by a water quality certification showing that the water meets the requirements listed below (refer to NSTM S9086-GX-STM-020/CH-220 V2 paragraph 220-22.18 through 220-22.22).  Constituent or Property Hardness—0.10 EPM max; Conductivity -<2.5 micro mho/CM* hardness. * NSTM S9086-GX-STM020/CH-220 V2 paragraph 220-22.24 states, “The maximum permissible demineralized makeup feedback conductivity is 1.0 micro mho/cm.  If the demineralized makeup feedwater conductivity exceeds this limit, the resin is expended.” 1.2	To ensure the feedwater, which is processed from shore water and provided to ships, meets the above standards, the Contractor shall continuously monitor the conductivity of the feedwater being provided and shall test the feedwater for silica before delivery to each ship.  When any test result indicates that the effluent does not meet the above standards, the Contractor shall test the water in all the ship’s feed tanks which received water.  The Contractor shall provide copies of all test results to the ship receiving the water. 1.3	pH will be measured with an in-line-mounted probe on the discharge side of the mobile demineralized by other products. 1.4	Hardness and alkalinity will be monitored by the Receiving Activity.  1.5	Shipside testing is to be completed on silica with the use of the Hach Low Level Silica Test Kit and on resistivity with a Blasbaugh Resistivity Monitor (use polyethylene bottles and avoid using a glass container which can give a false high silica result).  The test and certification is to be performed on site through the use of this equipment provided by the Contractor. 1.6	The exact amount of processed water going to the customer will be calculated via an inline Flow meter mounted on the discharge side of the mobile demineralized.  After completion of delivery of demineralized water to customer the Contractor shall not proceed to disconnect equipment until a ship’s force personnel has recorded the exact amount of product delivered by the Contractor.  The point of contact on the ship will be the Ship’s Oil King or the Main Propulsion Assistant (MPA). 2.0	Water Quality Certification 2.1	The Contractor will be required to furnish certification that each delivery meets the requirements listed in paragraph 1.1. 2.2	Certification shall be provided to the Engineering Officer of the receiving ship at the time delivery is made. 2.3	The Navy has the right to conduct independent testing to confirm that the water delivered is within specifications.  The Government will not make payment for any deliveries found not to meet specifications. 2.4	Inspection and acceptance of feedwater to be furnished shall be made at destination by the receiving activity.  Questions shall be handled by the Ordering Officer. 2.5	At the request of Southwest Regional Maintenance Center (SWRMC), a demineralized unit delivered to a ship can be retained at the delivery point by the Government when a complaint is received by SWRMC from the ship that the quality of water does not meet contract specifications.  Once retained by the Government, neither the Contractor nor the Government can operate the unit.  The unit will be tested for water quality within 24 hours and returned to the Contractor.  A representative from the ship alleging the poor water quality and the Contractor will observe operation of the unit and witness quality test performed by the Government and/or a separate water quality test performed by the Contractor. 2.6	Contractor/Facility shall continuously monitor the Contractor’s Demineralizer IAW NSTM 220-22.21 (Conductivity Cell). 2.7	Shore processed feedwater (demineralizers) or any other process other than steam condensation shall meet the requirements NSTM 220.22.20. 2.8	The Contractor shall provide the ship’s force point of contact, Ship’s Oil King or the Main Propulsion Assistant (MPA) with the most recent Pierside mobile demineralizers efficient meter readings prior to delivery. 2.9	The Contractor shall provide the ship’s force with the most recent Pierside mobile demineralizer mixed bed ion exchange resin change out date, efficient meter readings, and the projected date of the following resin change out. 2.10	The Contractor supplying the feedwater shall certify that a sample of the feedwater meets the requirements set forth in paragraph 2220-22.20.  Prior to supplying water to the ship’s feed system, Pierside demineralizers shall be flushed to the waste and flowing effluent shall be tested and certified by the Contractor as meeting the standards of paragraph 2220-22.20.  The requirement applies anytime Pierside demineralizers are secured and restarted regardless of the lead-time.  A manifold system shall be used such that the ship’s continuous flowing pierside demineralizer effluent can be directed to waste or ship’s feed system without interrupting the flow through the demineralizer.  A 100 mesh “Y”-type strainer shall be installed in the feed line to the ship to preclude resin contamination in the ship system. 2.11	To ensure that feedwater, which is processed from shore water and provided to ships, met the required standards, the Contractor shall test the feedwater for silica before delivery to each ship in accordance with NSTM 2220-22.20. 3.0	Contractor Facility and Experience 3.1	The Contractor will be required to regenerate, maintain, and repair mobile demineralizers. 3.2	The Contractor will be required to have facilities accept oral orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Mobile communication equipment shall be maintained in all delivery trucks. 4.0	Mobile Demineralization Specifications shall be as follows: 4.1	Exchange capacity shall be 750,000-1,000,000 grains for each mobile demineralizer and be regenerated after they have delivered 70% of their rated capacity. 4.2	The equipment furnished shall incorporate all features necessary for satisfactory operation in a sea and air environment. 4.3	The demineralizer shall consist of carbon steel, rubber lined (or equivalent) demineralizer trains containing at least one cation unit, one anion unit, and two parallel FRP mix bed units with interconnecting piping valves and accessories not specifically identified herein but required for an operable system.  The Contractor shall be required to supply industry standard “small” or “medium” demineralizers which are to be approximately 12’ H  x  8’  W  x  16’ L.  4.4	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with a batch meter device that shall automatically shut off the inlet valve when a pre-set number of gallons have been delivered.  This device shall be of a design that cannot be reset by ship’s company, only by the Contractor. 4.5	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with a resistivity monitor.  The delivery of feedwater shall be automatically terminated if the water exceeds specifications.  The resistivity monitor and cell shall be calibrated at least quarterly. 4.6	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with a fully automatic rinse control panel.  Unit  shall have a light to indicate control panel is on (and if not on, there is no power to the unit), a light indicating poor water quality and a 10 minute flushing cycle before being manually reset, and a light shall also indicate good water quality.  The Contractor is responsible for flushing all units at a maximum of 24 hours prior to arrival at the pier.  Contractor shall therefore pre-flush the equipment at their facility prior to any delivery. 4.7	No mobile demineralizer shall be delivered and set-up for a ship without a theoretically calculated number of gallons remaining in that mobile demineralizer.  Under normal circumstances, the mobile demineralizer shall shut down on the gallons delivered, not on exceeding resistivity limits. 4.8	Mobile demineralizers are to be placarded with detailed operating instructions including flushing procedures; and if necessary, instructions shall be displayed for recovery after there has been an interruption in delivery. 4.9	Raw water inlet and boiler feedwater outlet fittings shall be furnished by the Contractor and be compatible with Navy 1 ½” fire hose fittings. 4.10	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with a sample valve on the outlet for the purpose of taking water samples while equipment is operating. 4.11	Each mobile demineralizer shall be equipped with automatic air venting valves and inlet and outlet pressure gauges. 4.12	Each mobile demineralizer shall not exceed 12 feet (H) X 8 feet (W) X 16 feet (L) and a weight of 10,000 pounds. 4.13	The Contractor is required to use 120 degree Fahrenheit hot caustic injection, since silica loading of resin and break-through into the boiler feedwater is of great concern. 4.14	A “Y”-type strainer with ICU mesh filter in feed line is required. 4.15	Unit price shall include removal of all equipment after completion of deliveries. 5.0	Government Supplied Equipment 5.1	The Government will supply raw water at a minimum pressure of 40 PSI and at an estimated flow rate between 30 to 60 gallons per minute.  Due to variable demand at any pier for raw water, supply pressures could exceed 70 PSI or higher.  The Contractor shall be required to protect its own and any Government equipment from damage due to maximum pressure fluctuations by installing necessary regulating systems. 5.2	The Government will supply 120 volt, single phase, 60-hertz electrical power with a 3 prong female connector. 5.3	The Government will supply hoses from the pier water source to the mobile demineralizer and to the delivery point aboard ship.  In any instance where the Contractor notices a leak in the ship’s hoses or fittings, the Contractor shall notify the COR of the leak so that the ship can take corrective action to fix either the hose or fitting. 5.4	The Contractor is authorized to locate demineralizers on the pier in close proximity to the customer ships and shall be clear of fire lanes and parallel to the edge of the pier facing in the direction of the shore to allow for emergency evacuation if necessary. The maximum amount of time a demineralizer shall be allowed to remain on the pier is for one 24 hour period immediately after usage disconnect.  Vehicles physically attached to the ship via a hose may be parked unattended for their essential use only. 5.5	It is the Contractor’s responsibility to adhere to Navy parking regulations and the SOW requirements.  If the 24 hour period is exceeded, the Navy will exercise its authority to issue a summons and / or remove any equipment found to be in violation of Navy parking regulations at the Contractor’s expense.  Damages to the Contractor’s equipment will not be covered by the Contracts Dispute Act as they are not related to the contract.  If the Contractor is “parking” his equipment, he is liable like any other “driver” who violates on-base Navy parking regulations.  Currently, there is no established parking or staging area for equipment beyond its service to the ship. 6.0	Water Containment 6.1	To avoid unnecessary traffic on piers, water delivered under this contract will be produced by a mobile demineralizer as described below and stationed alongside the receiving ship, versus use of a bulk water tank truck. 6.2	Contractor shall provide containment around the demineralizer unit sufficient to contain water that leaks from the unit.  The term “unit” does not include hoses provided by the Navy.  Water that accumulates in the containment must be properly disposed.  Water that does leak from Navy connections or hoses and is captured by the secondary containment is the disposal responsibility of the Contractor.  Proper disposal includes, but is not limited to pumping to the BOWTS, CHT, or hauling off site.  The accumulated water may not be discharged directly into the San Diego Bay or onto the pier. 6.3	The exact amount of processed water going to the customer shall be calculated by means of an inline Flow meter mounted on the discharge side of the mobile demineralizer.  After completion of delivery of demineralized water to the customer, the Contractor shall not proceed to disconnect the equipment until a ship’s force personnel has recorded the exact amount of product delivered by the Contractor on attachment. 6.4	The Contractor is responsible for ensuring that his equipment is in good working order and does not leak.  The Contractor is responsible for providing a point of contact that shall be available at any time their equipment is on the pier.  The Contractor is responsible for repairing all leaks within 24 hours of being reported by any Navy personnel.  There shall be no additional charge for this repair. 6.5	As mentioned in 6.2, demineralizers shall not discharge any residual water to adjacent drains, San Diego Bay, or the pier.  Any discharge is considered an illicit discharge under Navy’s Storm Water Permits.  The Contractor shall adjust his dumping operations accordingly.  As a result, the Contractor is required to comply with all applicable Federal, State, and Local Environmental as well as Regulatory Laws including, but not limited to the following: Assimilative Crimes Act (18 USC 13), Federal Adoption of State Law (California Penal Code/Health and Safety Code 25789.5, Unauthorized Disposal of Hazardous Waste, Section 301 of the Clean Water Act, California Porter Cologne Water Quality Control Act, State Water Resources Control Board Water Quality Order No. 97-03.DWQ General Permit No. CAS000001 and Water Quality Control Plan for San Diego Basin (9).  Any instance of noncompliance by the Contractor shall require a report of this discharge to the Water Quality Control Boa!  rd.   6.6	The Contractor is prohibited from discharging wastes (including waste water) into the “Waters of the United States” or a conveyance system that discharges to “Waters of the United States” unless the discharge is specifically authorized or exempted by a National Pollutant Elimination System permit or by applicable regulations.  In addition, no such discharge is permitted without written authorization from the Commander Navy Region Southwest, Environmental Department. 7.0	Ordering / COR Information 7.1	Ships are not authorized to contact the Contractor directly.

Additionally, the contractor shall provide support for related products (web applications) and back end databases. The contractor shall perform all actions required to maintain the currency of the System Security Authorization Agreements (SSAA) under which DNSC operates. The contractor shall assist DNSC in integrating internetworking solutions with other applications, databases, systems, and networks that support the organization's mission.

The Defense National Stockpile Center (DNSC) intends to award a firm-fixed price contract to a Small Business for a base year with two option years.

Contract award will be made based on best value in accordance with FAR 12.6.

The solicitation will be posted on FEDBIZOPPS web page (i.e., www.fedbizopps.gov/) on or about September 18, 2006.  In accordance with FAR 5.102(D), availability of the solicitation will be limited to this electronic medium only.  Requests for other copies of the solicitation will be disregarded without notice to the requestor. 

Primary Point of Contact:     Chris Hall, Contract Specialist, 703-767-5498.

This Presolicitation Notice is Amended to answer the following questions:

Are these new requirements or a re-competition?

This is considered a new requirement.  

Is there an incumbent for this task?

The closest Contract for a similar requirement is SC0800-04-P-0035 awarded to Doyen Consulting Service in the amount of $2,889,744.80.  The period of performance under that contract was July 2004 through September 2006.  This Contractor is performing similar work with a broader scope than is now required.  The scope of the similar requirement has been reduced and DNSC expects the value of the new contract to be significantly lower than the value of contract SC0800-04-P-0035.

<DESC>The Rapid Unified Generation of Urban Databases (RUGUD) Army Technology Objective (ATO) is requesting information regarding commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and government off-the-shelf (GOTS) tool capabilities for inclusion in an urban database generation capability. The RUGUD program supports the Synthetic Environment Core?s Database Virtual Environment Development (DVED). 

The concept behind RUGUD is an open framework that allows COTS and GOTS tools to work cooperatively to compose terrain generation systems. RUGUD provides the infrastructure to track, manage, and manipulate data as it moves through the system, but relies on COTS and GOTS tools to perform import, cleanup, conflation, and tailoring, and export of data into multiple disparate end-use products.  One of the main goals of the RUGUD framework is to allow the use of the best COTS/GOTS tool for each component of the terrain generation process.  This request for information (RFI) is being issued to survey Other Government Agencies, Private Industry and Academia, to collect information and data that would be useful in exploring terrain generation capabilities.  

Purpose for the Request for Information:
This is not a solicitation for contract.  The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to survey Other Government Agencies, Industry and Academia, in order to collect information and data about urban database generation capabilities.  

Other Government Agencies, Industry and Academia Participation:
This exercise will identify other government, industry and university organizations that have an interest in providing information on their recent developments and future plans for urban generation capabilities.  All interested technology providers/vendors are invited to participate in this exercise on a purely voluntary basis.  

Survey Information: 
Please include information regarding each of the following in your response. These include 
?	cost, 
?	licensing, 
?	breadth and maturity of the tool to meet a particular component capability, 
?	ability to execute through API or parameterized command-line,
?	ability to execute individual capabilities independent of others (e.g. generate TIN).

RUGUD attempts to use the best tool available for any particular terrain generation capability. As such, lack of capability in one or more areas does not exclude a tool from consideration.

In addition to the information provided above use the following numbered weights to indicate the level of maturity of each identified capability.  Guidance is as follows:

4 ? Industry leading capability
3 ? In line with current industry capability
2 ? Individual pieces needed to compose capability exist and can be instrumented collectively to satisfy capability
1 ? Some capability and/or near-term (within 1 year) planned enhancements
0 ? little or no capability exists

An ?explanation of capability? statement should be included to provide justification for the rating. 




Please provide all or as much information as possible on compact disks, DVDs, memory sticks and/or other appropriate digital media no later than  31 August 2006 to the Simulation & Training Technology Center (STTC)/RDECOM, ATTN:  Mr. Julio De La Cruz, 12423 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL  32826-3276.
	
*It is anticipated that the results of the RFI will identify other government agencies, private industry and academia that have an interest in providing information on their recent developments and future plans for urban generation capabilities.  This is not a solicitation for a contract; however, those entities that respond with information should submit their response no later than 30 September 2006 to the attention of Mr. Julio De La Cruz, Lead Principal Investigator, Phone (407) 384-3733, Fax (407) 384-5440, email address Julio.Delacruz@us.army.mil.

Development and publication of a technology roadmap does not constitute Army/ RDECOM/STTC direction to start any contractual efforts.  All participation from interested technology providers/vendors is on a purely voluntary basis.

Estimated design-build cost: $6-10 million.

Award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds. 

Project Solicitation


THE PROJECT SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES. This announcement for pre-qualification is Phase I. The Department of State will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the following Evaluation Factors. Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation (Request for Proposal) and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II. The government reserves the right not to pre-qualify any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in any evaluation factors and sub-factors. 

Prior Prequalification

Firms that submitted a prequalification package for projects of similar scope and dollar value during FY 2004 and/or 2005 and/or 2006   and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit a complete pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. 

	Letter of Interest:  The letter must be submitted in accordance with the above. However, if any changes have occurred in a company's structure, size status, or Primary Design-Build Team since the submission of the original design-build pre-qualification package, the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable.  Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification, the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for these projects.

	Prequalification based on successful prior prequalification is subject to a satisfactory evaluation of Past and Present Performance as described in Factor 3 below.  Offerors need not provide additional Past Performance information.  The Government will determine the extent to which past performance will be evaluated and the internal and/or external sources from which past performance information will be sought, if any.

Prequalification Requirements

The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation. Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design-build RFP.

The requirements of the Act will be applied to all Phase II proposals received.

<DESC>Questions for Solicitation VA-549-06-RP-0005 will not be accepted after the Close of Business (COB) on Septebmer 7, 2006. Questions and answers: On Sheet 0.01 they show the bar joist to be fire rated using gyp board as listed in UL Design P519. However they show the steel beams to be sprayed with fireproofing as listed in UL design S717. If UL Design P519 is used it should provide the fire rating needed for the steel beams as well. Please clarify what members are intended to receive sprayed fireproofing and what members are to be protected by gyp board. Structural members to be sprayed and to have gypsum board The corner guards listed on the finish schedule are Flush Mounted; however the interior elevations only show them a 2’ high.  Flush Mounted corner guards are usually in full height applications.  It would be better to stop the handrail and crash rail before the corner and use end caps, and install a 4” Surface Mounted Corner Guard at the corners.  Reason: the Outside corners of the handrail and crash rail as currently drawn will be susceptible to abuse.  The higher corner guard will be able to withstand abuse better. All corner guards to be surface mounted Model number SM-10 by CS GROUP ACROVYN. Omit the specification shown on sheet A1.05  Drawing A104 has a note in room A0-4-“hand rail/crash rail” typical all walls”.  Is the intention to have hard rail and crash rail on all walls in the patient rooms? Typical room will only have bumper bed rail ref to sheet A1.05 no hand rails and crash rails should be included in resident rooms. Corner guards are indicated as “CG” on drawings; however, there is also a note that indicates corner guards typical all outside corners.  Should we include corner guards for every outside corner?  Will the Corner Guards in patient rooms be a different height if so what height is required? Corner guards to be as shown on sheet A1.05 We cannot locate the interior elevation that shows the length of the Bed Locator.  What is the desired length? 6’-0” (3’-0” From center of bed to each side) Is there a difference between BB1, BB2 and BB3 (different colors). Yes Colors match room color scheme as shown on A1.05. Rigid sheet- .040 is this required 4’ high down every hallway and in every patient room as is shown on the elevations? Yes. Ref to Typical elevations for corridors and resident rooms shown on sheet A2.01 Kick plates and door frame protection is indicated on the specifications and finish legend – none is shown on the drawings.  Is there door protection needed on this project? Kick plates to be provided only at the corridor doors ref to sheets A1.01 for location, A2.01 and A1.05 “Material legend” for specification. Sheet A2.01 “Door types” “E” provides dimensions for the kick plates. Omit “stainless steel “specification listed on this sheet. Push plates are not to be used in this project. There is no specification on Cubicle Curtains?  Is this product required? Owner to provide not in the scope of work

<DESC>This notice does not constitute an Invitation for Bids or a Request for Proposal, and it is not a commitment by the Department of the Navy to procure products or services.

The Initial Capabilities Document (ICD) for Vertical Unmanned Aircraft System 
(VUAS), 4 October, 2005, established a requirement for a VUAS as a follow-on to the Pioneer Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) System. As a top level summary of system capabilities, the air vehicle should be capable of:
a)	operations from austere sites and all air capable ships
b)	carrying a Modular Mission Payload  with the ability to search, detect, locate, track, classify, and designate
c)	the necessary combination of speed, range and endurance to participate in missions with current and future USMC air assets (V-22, JSF, etc.)
d)	speed to reduce transit time and cover more area during a set time aloft
e)	a minimum of 10 days system persistence to support MEU missions at a range of 110 nm from the Seabase and a minimum of 30 days of persistence is required for MEB level missions at a range of 110 nm
f)	inter/intra theater transportation of all components of the VUAV system on a  KC-130 (as per USMC Vertical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Concept of Operations)
g)	surviving in a high threat environment by possessing low visual, infrared and acoustic signatures, and a reduced Radar Cross Section (RCS)
 
This abbreviated list of required system capabilities is for preliminary screening; a more comprehensive list of required attributes is available in the ICD and documents referenced therein. The VUAS will also be capable of supporting Marine Corps Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) and Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM). The VUAS system will comprise fully integrated components, including: air vehicle, modular and interchangeable payloads, Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) interface systems, ground control systems, launch and recover equipment, and automatic take-off and landing subsystems. The VUAS will be expected to successfully operate within the mobility and transportability constraints of the Marine Corps.

The Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air Programs (DASN (AIR)) and Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) are sponsoring an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA). To support the AoA the Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is conducting a market survey to obtain industry input relative to its capabilities to satisfy the Marine Corps Vertical Unmanned Aerial System requirements documented in the ICD. We desire any information on capabilities and performance of the respondent's system/air vehicle as it relates to the capabilities given in the ICD and consistent with the VUAS having an Initial Operating Capability (IOC) as early as FY15. This data will be used in the AoA. 

Please include in your response information addressing: 
(1) development status of the aircraft design and of major subsystems and components, expressed as Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) and any other applicable measure; (2) production status of major subsystems and components; (3) availability of design and support documentation, such as specifications of major subsystems and components; (4) all data links used, including discussion of net-ready and joint interoperability capabilities; (5) sensor payloads, payload capability, weapons load out and payload growth capacity (weight and power); (6) concepts for system load out on a C130, CH-53 and other intra-theater Marine Corps transport; (7) growth paths for any performance area that does not meet the requirements including ability to spiral to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE) capabilities. 

Also requested are estimated costs, to include but not necessarily be limited to: (8) Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) and production costs, for the entire system broken out by costs for (9) an air vehicle with an electro-optical/infrared/laser designator modular payload and a communication relay package as well as the ability to interchange these with future payloads such as Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), Imagery Intelligence (IMINT), Measurement and Signature Intelligence (MASINT), and radar based reconnaissance capabilities, Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); (10) the Electro-Optical/Infrared/Laser (EO/IR/LD) designator modular payload itself, including integration costs, (11) any Ground Control Station (GCS) costs and (12) Software Lines Of Code (SLOC) counts and costs associated with the air vehicle and the payload. Some examples of possible cost categories for the Air Vehicle are: airframe, engine, communications suite, avionics, and landing gear; however, the response should use categories most appropriate for the specific system and (13) test program requirements and costs broken out by flight tests and ground based testing, and (14) System Engineering and Program Management (SEPM) equivalent head counts and costs.

The response should include the following air vehicle (AV) specific data: (15) AV structural design data including minimum and maximum load factors at design gross weight, (16) six-view drawings or Computer Aided Design (CAD) models (unfolded and folded as applicable; Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES) format preferred), internal arrangement drawings, and geometric data on all components; (17) performance data (such as Take-off Gross Weight/endurance as a function of speed and altitude at Sea Level/Standard Day (ISA) and 3000?/91.5? conditions; Payload-Range curves, Time on Station vs. Radius of Action graphs)  (18) drag estimate listed by component and drag polars, (19) Group Weight Statement, (20) engine data including engine type, Shaft Horse Power (SHP) (or thrust), Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC), fuel type, fuel flow at different power settings/altitudes/atmospheric conditions (Sea Level/ISA & 3K/91.5?)/velocities, (21) design mission and design constraints used for designing the Air Vehicle (if applicable), (22) data on RF, IR, visual and acoustic signatures on the AV system and any existing data on survivability and/or vulnerability against potential threat systems, and (23) the ability to spiral to carry future payloads such as SIGINT, IMINT, MASINT, and radar based reconnaissance capabilities, such as GMTI and SAR. 

The response should include the following EO/IR/LD sensor data: (24) Instantaneous Fields of View (IFOV); (25) Fields of View (FOV); (26) Fields of Regard (FOR) given as azimuth, elevation, and slew rate; (27) pixel count for all resolutions; (28) ground resolution as a function of altitude/slant range; (29) detection sensitivity and ability to detect selected targets as a function of altitude/slant range for a standard day weather for each FOV; (30) any detection sensitivity data available for specific ground battlefield targets such as tanks or trucks as a function of altitude/slant range and humidity, weather, and battle field obscurants for each FOV. 

The response should include the following ground control station data: (31) compatibility with the Pioneer Replacement Ground Control System (RGCS)/Army ?One System? GCS/planned GCS that will operate USMC UAS as part of its Family of Systems concept, and (32) open architecture capabilities. 

Information in your response should also address logistics support requirements: (33) maintenance to include inspections and servicing, and the recommended maintenance concept; (34) reliability and maintainability (R&M) data; (35) Training, (36) Manpower; (37) Support Equipment; (38) hardware, and computer resources; (39) Packaging, Handling, Storage and Transportation (PHS&T); (40) Facilities, and (41) Supply, to include obsolescence mitigation. 

The VUAS must be capable of takeoff and landing from all air capable ships. Provide data, if available, on: (42) launch and recovery and the method to securely retain the VUAS before takeoff and after touchdown, (43) a method of automatically transitioning from a takeoff point to a marshalling point and from a marshalling point to touchdown relative to the ship, (44) interfaces to, or compatibility with, existing Naval C4I systems and future Marine Corps Command and Control nodes, and (45) the Air Vehicle?s ability to be ship suitable and survive in a maritime environment (aircraft control power to accommodate operations on a pitching and moving deck, aircraft folding (if required), tie-down points, corrosion resistant features, tolerance of shipboard electromagnetic environment, etc). 

System maturity, as evidenced by demonstrated performance and flight data of 
major subsystems and components from off-the-shelf systems/air vehicles is highly 
preferable; lengthy development alternatives are not desired. Responding parties 
should submit a written statement of interest along with the above requested 
supporting unclassified data, and POC to contact for any necessary clarification or 
additional data required by the analysis and information on any necessary non-
disclosure agreements, by close of business October 10, 2006, to the

<SUBJECT>A -- DARPA CROSSHAIRS Phase 1 Follow-on Effort
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Contracts Management Office (DARPA/CMO) intends to award a sole source contract to Mustang Technology Group, LP, 400 W. Bethany Drive, Suite 110, Allen, TX  75013-3714 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements, 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  The proposed procurement is for follow-on effort related to Phase 1 of the CROSSHAIRS Program.  The objective of this effort will be to develop and demonstrate a complete CROSSHAIRS system comprised of a vehicle mounted sensor system and threat response capability, as well as to procure prototype systems for user testing.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals and a written solicitation will not be issued.

<SUBJECT>--USAMRMC, Activity Based Costing (ABC) Modeling project, Fort Detrick, MD
<DESC>Statement of Work Activity Based Costing And Cost Analysis, Deputy for Resource Management, United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command  General.  This Statement of Work, (SOW), comprises all activities and services to manage the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) Activity Based Costing (ABC) Modeling, Cost Analysis and Lean Six Sigma.  Our goals are to improve quality , eliminate waste, reduce cycle time and reduce costs for the Unites States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) and its subordinate elements. BACKGROUND. 1.  Activity Based-Costing (ABC) is a tool to help the Unites States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command (USAMRMC) effectively manage resources and processes to deliver the best medical solutions, for today and tomorrow, to enhance, protect and trea t the warfigher on point for the nation.  USAMRMC will use ABC to decompose and analyze the mission into specific work activities for measuring cost and performance.  ABC is a tool to enable USAMRMC to monitor and evaluate performance and cost and improve efficiency and cost effectiveness of the way we do business. 2.  A major step in the ABC process is Analyze Costs. This is the culmination of all measurements and calculations that have occurred. The ABC model and other information are reviewed and analyzed in depth to identify opportunities for improvement.  The ob ject is to achieve massive savings in time and dollars by changing the basic rules and structure. If a concept or process does not contribute value to the output, with value described as value to the customer, then it may not be necessary.  If it is not re quired by law, then it should be eliminated or reduced substantially.  The major notion is that nothing in policy or procedures is sacrosanct. 3.  Activities and work processes are the objective of reengineering or improvement processes, not the organizational elements.  Merely reorganizing departments and branches will not achieve the dramatic results that are sought.  The major purpose for so m uch effort in developing the activity model is to allow the reengineering effort to be applied to how the work is actually done, not how the entity is organized to accomplish the work. This model and the identification of the resulting process flows is int ended to strip away the veneer of organizational structure that hides the real functions. 4.  There are two basic areas available for review in selecting possible change opportunities.  The first is the activity model.  The second is the process flow(s) selected for primary review and improvement.  The ABC process has collected and stratified s everal bits of information about the activities in the activity model which can now be applied to both.  This still only gives a general area at which to look.  Merely reviewing data and anomalies will not yield improvement suggestions.   5.  To convert the raw indicator data of the activities and process flow to useful information and change scenarios, requires a set of analysis tools that can be applied to the characteristic information. There are a multitude of helpful analysis tools ava ilable. The following partial list is some of the more important and useful tools that routinely yield productive results: A.  Pareto Analysis:  Pareto analysis is a simple ranking tool to assist in the selection of the largest or smallest component of costs.  Based on the theory that eighty percent of the total cost is normally generated by twenty percent of the activity, thi s analysis is used to array activities or elements of cost in various displays using different ranking criteria.  B.  Benchmarking:  Benchmarking is an excellent tool for garnering ideas without the stress of original creative thinking.  The major danger is that it will inhibit real improvement.  The candidate for comparison and observation should not only be the best  in their line of work but the best in the w orld, if possible.  When this is not true or sometimes even when it is, the comparison allows the improvement team to observe a major performer and then set their improvement goals too low.  This serves to limit what can be accomplished. Benchmarking is fo r gathering ideas, but the application and improvement should springboard from these ideas, not be limited by them. C.  Best Practices:  Best practices is similar to benchmarking.  It differs in that it is not the review of a best process but of isolated best performances of parts of the process.  These may also be internal or external.  Finding the best tool, procedure  or method is still an improvement with a potential productivity increase.  This cross-fertilization of good ideas is excellent not only for creating new ideas in process design, but also as a mainstay program for continued excellence. D.  Value Added Analysis:  Is a tool to determine if elements within a process flow provide value.  If an activity step in a process flow does not provide additional value, then it may be unnecessary with the possibility of being eliminated.  This would be  an immediate process improvement with minimal to no cost. E:  Comparative Analysis:  Comparative analysis is targeted on similar activities or flows that exist in parallel within the activity model or process flow to ensure that they are being done the same best way.  F:  Cost Benefit Analysis:  Determines if a new element or minor change will in some way be improved over the previous option.  G:  Economic Analysis:  Economic analysis compares alternatives for the best overall solution in terms of dollars and time. H.  Functional Economic Analysis:  The Functional Economic Analysis is a technique for analyzing and evaluating alternative process improvements, management practices, and new investments in relation to the overall goals and objectives of the organization.  This encompasses a vast array of information and policy into one evaluation.  The result is a fully considered organizational decision that fulfills as many of the objectives and goals as possible at the most effe ctive cost-benefit ratio.  I.  Linear Regression Analysis:  Linear regression is a statistic method to determine a formula for predicting the relationships of one set of data by determining the slope and y-intercept (the point where the line crosses the y-axis) of the line that best  fits the data of a dependent and independent variable. J.  Multiple regression:  Multiple regression is the analysis of more than one set of data, which often produces a more realistic projection. K.  Quality Improvement:  Quality Improvement is achieved through an understanding of customers expectations and requirements and employing tools such as quality function deployment.   L.  Eliminate Waste:  Eliminate the seven types of waste:  Overproduction, Waiting, Transport, Extra Processing, Inventory, Motion, and defects.   M.  Reduce Lead Time:  Identify wasteful logistical practices both upstream and downstream in the demand/supply chain. 6.  The major objective of the ABC Cost Analysis is to objectively determine a better way for USAMRMC to do business. The analysis of ABC costs and models serves to provide the basis from which these decisions can be made and evaluated.  SCOPE OF WORK.  1.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Eagle Brand Tactical Accessories.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for compatibility with other equipment in use by the Office of Mobile Security Deployments, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. DS/T/MSD requires heavy duty, high durability, black and tan tactical nylon equipment pouches, belts and load bearing equipment, compatible with DS/T/MSD tactical body armor systems.  This load bearing equipment is necessary to allow MSD personnel to carry issued weapons, weapons accessories and equipment.  Eagle brand tactical accessories have been determined to be the only brand of tactical accessories meeting the durability, compatibility and color requirements for these tactical accessories.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements.

<DESC>FA8629-06-C-2366.  RDA Cables.  This is a presolicitation synopsis.  The Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC), Battlefield Airmen Squadron (670 AESS) intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Smartronix to provide 315 Radio Data Adapter (RDA) cables.  The RDA cable combines the functions of several existing cables into one multi-functional cable in order to transmit data from a computer through the PRC-117F or PRC-148 radios.  This allows the computer to perform four different radio interface tasks using a single USB connection.  This provides the benefits of reduced weight, reduced power requirements, quicker radio setup, lower cost (due to using fewer separate cables) and simplified radio operations. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  The government intends to award the effort pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 since Smartronix is the only firm that currently manufactures these cables. The proposed contractual action has a expected period of performance of 12 months.   

The Point of Contact for this action is 670 AESS/PK, 1895 Fifth Street, Wright-Patterson AFB OH 45433-7200, Attn: Nancy Leggett, Contracting Officer, (937) 255-4284 and e-mail nancy.leggett@wpafb.af.mil.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions); 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held; 
    (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>CORRECTION TO ANNOUNCEMENT E9929060032, RFQ# Q9929060032, PROVIDE AND INSTALL NEW MGE GALAXY 4000 DATA CENTER UPS OR EQUAL. THE QUOTE DUE DATE IN THE DESCRIPTION BLOCK OF THE ABOVE-REFERENCED COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT WAS LISTED AS 19 AUGUST 2006.  IT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO READ 19 SEPTEMBER 2006. NO OTHER CHANGES ARE REFLECTED IN THIS DESCRIPTION BLOCK. Description:  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ), number Q9929060032 and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-09.  This is total small business set-aside procurement.  The Small Business size standard is $6 mil.  The NAICS is 811310.  The contract will be awarded as a purchase order using simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with the provisions of FAR 13.5.  The requirement is for providing and installing a new Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system for the purpose of providing continuous conditioned power to the network infrastructure for the National Park Service, Alaska Regional Office located at 240 W. 5th Ave., Anchorage, AK 99501.  When responding to this RFQ contractors shall provide pricing as follows: CLIN 0001, Provide and Install MGE Galaxy 4000 Data Center UPS OR EQUAL and disconnect and remove existing 18KVA UPS system; turn over to NPS IT Personnel for disposition.  $_____________  The quote must include all costs of installation including any necessary transformers or other ancillary equipment.   The proposed UPS system shall be capable of providing the following specification:  1. SCOPE. This item describes the requirements for the Contractor to provide and install a new 40KVA 3-Phase UPS System and remove the existing 18KVA UPS system at the NPS Regional Office located at 240 W. 5th Ave., Anchorage AK 99501.  The old 18KVA UPS system once removed will be turned over to NPS IT Personnel for Government disposition. (Government retains ownership).   2. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE UPS SYSTEM:  The UPS system will replace an existing single phase, 18KVA UPS system with a minimum of a 3-phase 40 KVA system.  The building is equipped with an emergency generator which assumes the load within 2 minutes of a power interruption therefore the proposed UPS must only be rated to provide a minimum of 10 minutes of output at full load.  The system will be located on the first floor, in the location of the existing UPS system, and will supply 3-phase power to one or more distribution panels in the 2nd floor server room.  The proposed system must be expandable to at least 50KVA without increasing the footprint beyond the approximate 3.5 foot X 6 foot area (exclusive of transformers) occupied by the current system.  The UPS system proposed must be manageable via an Ethernet network and any necessary software must be Microsoft Windows compatible.   3. SPECIFICATIONS:  All UPS power distribution must be from a breaker panel located in the server room.  The preferred location for the distribution panel is indicated on the accompanying server room diagram along with the existing Electrical panels and UPS outlets.  The existing 110 volt UPS outlets on the walls and near the 72 inch racks will be moved over to the new UPS system.  The 110 volt UPS outlets above the cabinets will be replaced with new outlets located more toward the front of the cabinets.  The panel nearest the door is a 3 phase 208/120 volt 100 amp panel that feeds the non-UPS outlets in the server room as well as lights and outlets in the adjoining Information Technology office and lab areas.  It also feeds the network distribution rooms on each floor.  The electrical panel currently furthest from the door is a single phase panel that feeds UPS power to the thirty two (32) 110 volt and four (4) 220 volt outlets indicated by red and green triangles in the drawing. (email Andy Toller at Andrew_Toller@nps.gov for instructions to download this drawing).  New 110 volt outlets must be mounted beneath the overhead wire basket location at or near the position shown on the diagram.  The cabinet nearest the door is the only one requiring 220 volt power.  Two (2) 110 volt outlets will be added to that cabinet.  The two (2) 220 volt outlets near the 72 inch racks will be converted to 110 volt UPS outlets.  All outlets will be locking to eliminate the adaptors currently in use.  The UPS outlets along the wall currently are fed with a single 20 AMP circuit for four (4) outlets while the other UPS outlets are fed with two (2) 20 AMP circuits each feeding duplex outlet.  The outlets that are just being switched from the old UPS to the new UPS will not change this scheme, however, the outlets being replaced above the cabinets will only require one (1) locking outlet per circuit.  The panel(s) installed will have sufficient breaker capacity to increase the number of 110 volt UPS circuits from forty-two (42) to sixty (60) so that future expansion will only require the addition of circuit breakers, conduit and outlets within the room.  The installation must include a "computer room kill switch" installation next to the server room door that will remove power from all UPS outlets in the event of an emergency.  The switch must be physically protected from accidental activation.  The NPS may specify the location of up to an additional five (5) UPS outlet locations during installation and should be addressed in the contractor's quote.  The project must include the complete and accurate labeling of all circuits and circuit breaker panels.   4.  PHASING/SCHEDULING OF WORK (PROPOSED):  The installation must be accomplished with a minimum of interruption of service.  To accomplish this, the following procedure will be followed:  1. The new distribution panel(s) and new 110 volt outlets will be installed and wired.  2. The existing system will be switched to bypass (moving the load directly to commercial power) and then the existing UPS can be disconnected.  3.  The new UPS system will be installed and wired, tested and activated.  The unused 110 volt outlets on the walls and the 110 volt outlets near the 72 inch racks that will transition to the new UPS can be moved to the new panel at this time.  The unused 220 volt outlets near the 72 inch racks may be rewired as 110 volt at this time (one will be relocated two (2) feet at this time).  4.  Equipment with redundant power supplies will be moved (hot) from the old outlets to the new UPS outlets during normal business hours.  5.  The switchover of any equipment that is both critical and does not have redundant power supplies as well as the 220 volt ESN equipment will be scheduled after 6:00 PM in coordination with NPS IT Personnel.  6. Distribution rooms on each of the floors can be switched from their current panel to the new UPS panel during normal business hours.  7. The bypass switch, the old single phase panel, the abandoned 110 volt outlets and all associated conduit can be removed at the end of this work schedule.  NOTE:  The NPS is open to a different sequencing proposal which constitutes an improvement over the above description without increasing the length of disruption in service.   5.  SCHEDULED SITE VISIT:  There is a scheduled site visit set for September 12, 2006 starting at 1:00 PM local time.  Interested vendors should meet NPS personnel in the lobby of the NPS Alaska Regional Office at 240 W.  5th Ave., Anchorage, AK 99501 at 1:00 PM where they will be escorted as a group into the area where work is to be preformed.

The UTM Company is the only vendor in the commercial market that meets specific training safety requirements that are essential to reduce the risk of serious personal injuries using training non-lethal projectiles.  In addition, UTM products will significantly reduce equipment maintenance and replacement cost for the Diplomatic Security Training Center (DSTC).   At present, UTM offers unique ballistic features that guarantee great reliability, exceptional performance, and a wide-range of training applications for the Diplomatic Security (DS) warrant service and dignitary protection-training programs.  These UTM products will be used to support the High Threat Tactical (HTT) training program currently being offered by DSTC. The DSTC Special Skills Branch (SSB) has put the UTM products through a comprehensive evaluation under field training conditions.  These UTM products consist of both Man Marker Rounds (MMR) and Battlefield Blank Rounds (BBR), and protective equip.  The evaluation was part of DSTC search for a training projectile that would minimize training injuries for the DS high threat protection and room entry tactics programs.  Instructors with vast tactical experience evaluated the UTM products during several training cycles.  In addition, students with diverse law-enforcement and military background were given the opportunity to evaluate the UTM products.  The results were highly favorable.  Furthermore, the MMR/BBR was tested against the most common non-lethal projectile training system that is currently being used within the law enforcement community and various units in the U.S. Armed Forces.  Without a doubt, the MMR/BBR proved to be a superior product.   UTM’s unique characteristics allowed the students to maintain consistent shot accuracy up to 25 yards.  It also permitted the students to properly use their weapon sights, thus re-enforcing the correct marksmanship fundamentals.  Moreover, it significantly reduced weapon malfunctions due to barrel fouling and accumulation of wax residues in the bolt chamber.  Instead of requiring students to wear bulky and restrictive protective equipment, the MMR/BBR allowed the students to wear normal clothing for training.  This was an important factor for adding realism to training. Conversely, the other commercial product proved to be less suitable for force-on-force training applications.  The system is available in both 5.56 mm and 9mm.  The key features of the UTM include the following: 1.  The UTM ammunition marks the target whether it hits a soft or hard target, whatever the angle and whatever the impact velocity.  The marking projectile is “NOT” required to break open. The projectile is a plastic cruciform dome, over an aluminum sabot, which contains a marking compound and a small 3mm inertial body behind the marking compound.  When fired the inertial body is under acceleration and stays to the rear.  When the projectile hits a target the outer body is slowed and the inertial body moves forward expelling the marking compound.  UTM projectiles have a metal to metal contact inside the barrel on each firing.  No plastic contacts the rifling or other residue is left in the barrel.  The marking compound does not freeze and works in the temperature range of –20 C to +40 C. 2.  The fundamental technology behind the UTM system is a two primer, expanding cartridge made of two hollow zinc die-cast parts, which fit or seal together to form a piston.  The cartridge only contains TWO primers.  No other propellant is used.  A rear primer fires a small plastic ball forward down the inside of the cartridge case and simultaneously fills the piston with gas causing it to expand and “blowback” the bolt or slide.  A second, smaller primer is located forward in the nose of the cartridge behind the projectile.  It is in line with the rear primer and is fired by the plastic ball.  This front primer is used solely to propel the lightweight composite projectile.  The combination of the cleanest explosive available and aluminum jacketed bullets provide a clean ammunition system, which is trouble free from misfires, mis-feeds or barrel fouling. 3.  The advantages of the UTM system are that the energy is required to perform the two functions are kept separate.  The rear primer responsibility is to cycle the weapon. Cycling the weapon typically takes 40-60 ft/lbs in a rifle or pistol.  The forward primer provides constant velocities to the projectile.  A projectile, which is safe at the muzzle, must have less that 3ft/lbs.  By separating the energies, cartridges can be made to operate weapons with a heavier cycling requirement (like the M249) will NOT produce any different muzzle velocity if fired from the M16. 4.  Lead free, heavy metal free primers are available for the propelling primers, which vent to atmosphere.  The cartridge system contains all the gas from the rear primers.  However, currently no manufacturer in the world makes “NON-TOXIC” rim fire cartridges.  The UTM MMR/BBR does not fracture the SWD (Ballistic) lens when fired point-blank.  I personally experienced a shot fired at a distance of 4-6 inches.  The UTM does not penetrate skin when fired at a lightweight type of clothing.  This is extremely important for added realism training.  Other products (such as a simunition, and paint ball) require heavier type protection equipment  to safely conduct training. 5.  The UTM system does not alter the reliability of the weapon system.  The system is technically capable of shooting a 41 mm x 100 mm group at 25 meters from a fixed barrel gun). In normal (hand held use) a 2” group at 10 meters from pistols and 4” group at 30 meters from rifles is readily achievable.  The ammunition functions the weapon in a full climatic range –20 C to -40 C. In summary, UTM provides the world’s safest and most accurate training munitions (non-toxic) and weapon conversion kits.  The MMR/BBR would permit tactical training instructors to make training scenarios safer and more realistic. It would also allow tactical instructors the ability to facilitate learning and provide the most accurate performance feedback to the students. This should be an important factor for any security or law-enforcement organization that has very limited time and opportunities to train and qualify its personnel in the proper application of lethal force while exposed to high stress conditions.  Unquestionably, the BBR would improve skill proficiency and better prepare DS Special Agents for domestic and overseas missions.  Additionally, it would also reduce equipment replacement cost and alleviate maintenance workload for the instructor staff, which is extremely critical to maintain the training center’s operational tempo.  Furthermore, major training institutions such as the Federal Law-Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), military units, and private companies are currently adopting this training system into their training programs.

(iii) This requirement is for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN), an association of Veterinary Diagnostic labs which have been authorized by the USDA APHIS Veterinary Services to perform certain diagnostic tests for VS surveillance programs and in the event of a disease outbreak. (iv) This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  (v) The provisions and clauses incorporated into this solicitation document are those in effect at the time of publication.  Provisions and clauses incorporated by reference have the same force and effect as if they were given in full text.  The full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) can be accessed on the Internet at http://www.arnet.gov/far/ (vi) REQUIREMENT AND QUANTITIES: This requirement consists of three line items:  
Seven (7) Magnetic Particle Processors for 96-well plate DNA/RNA Extraction and the complete equipment components for each piece of equipment to perform the processes described below in section (x) CLIN 02 ? Shipping of the equipment to the FOB destination.  CLIN 03 ? Installation and start up the equipment as well training the staff on the use of the equipment. This equipment will be distributed to multiple laboratory locations in the United States.  The actual locations will be determined at a later date. Actual travel costs CLINS 03 will be reimbursed at the rates provided in the Federal Travel or Joint Federal Travel Regulations and travel must be in accordance with Federal Government Travel Regulations.   (vii)  The selected manufacturer must be able to deliver all requested systems within three (3) months of order placement.  Deliverables and acceptance of deliverables will be FOB destination USDA, NVSL, 1800 Dayton Avenue in Ames, IA  50010. (viii) The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE for this contract is from date of award through delivery of all the equipment. The contractor shall provide delivery of all equipment no later than November 30, 2006. (ix) OBJECTIVES: The diagnostic tests performed by the NAHLN have been validated for specific pieces of laboratory equipment and sets of diagnostic reagents.  The NAHLN laboratories are expected to only perform the diagnostic tests according to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that outline the type of equipment and reagents to use.  The current goal of the NAHLN is to increase diagnostic testing capacity and capability for Foreign Animal Diseases (FADs) to enhance veterinary diagnostic preparedness in the event of a FAD outbreak in domestic livestock or poultry.  With the elevated national concern and apprehension of the introduction of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza into the United States, the NAHLN has been directed by the USDA to double the current diagnostic testing capacity for the real time RT-PCR (real time Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction) assay.  The NAHLN will accomplish this goal by providing laboratory equipment to approved NAHLN laboratories that increase the platform for the real time RT-PCR assay from single wells to 96 well plates.  One specific piece of necessary equipment is a magnetic particle processor capable of automatically performing the sample preparation steps of DNA/RNA (Ribonucleic Acid) extraction in the 96 well plate format. This statement of work is to define a semi-automated system for performing the 96 well plate platform viral RNA extraction method on the Avian Influenza real time RT-PCR assay.  Although this process can be accomplished manually, it is more efficient for the laboratory performing this assay if a piece of laboratory equipment performs the steps of this extraction process.  (x) TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:  Each magnetic particle processor must meet the following technical specifications in order to be technically acceptable. 
Because the approved extraction kit for the 96 well plate uses the Ambion-R MagMAXtm paramagnetic beads, the selected equipment must be a magnetic particle processor. Must be able to process Ambion-R MagMAXtm paramagnetic beads included in the AI/ND Viral RNA Isolation Kit.
Must be able to utilize a 96-well microplate for PCR applications
Must allow processing through a minimum of 5 reagents (lysis, purification, elution, etc.)
Must allow software programming functionality for multiple protocols and multiple processing steps in each protocol including: incubation, capture / collection of paramagnetic beads, washing with rinse solution, elution of purified material from magnetic beads, and transfer of purified material into 96-well PCR amplification plate.
Must be able to shake/agitate contents of each well during incubation 
Software must be compatible with Microsoft XP operating system
Must achieve at least 90% collection recovery of the magnetic particles in each well at each process step
Must not allow carry over of reagents from plate to plate or cross contamination of beads from well to well.
Must be able to process one plate of 96 samples through the complete procedure in 30 - 45 minutes. 
Must have a 1 year warranty for all parts, labor, travel and include installation, start up training, and support for validated applications.  The contractor must include in their services, travel to the sites to install and start up the equipment and train the staff on the use of the equipment. 
The magnetic particle processor must be able to manipulate multiple 96 well plates filled with different reagent solutions so that the paramagnetic beads (with viral RNA bound to them) can be lifted from one reagent plate to another.  There can be no mixing of materials (reagents or beads) from one well to another on the same plate.  This is typically accomplished with a magnetic particle processor head that contains 96 magnetic rods.   Therefore a separate magnetic rod will contact each separate well on the 96 well plate. In addition to the technical specifications described above, the magnetic particle processor must be able to perform the following protocols are listed here: (a) insert a protective covering over each of the magnetic rods i.e. plastic tip cover; (b) allow for the 96 well initial sample plate to be loaded into the equipment; (c) allow a 4 minute incubation and gentle mixing cycle for the initial sample plate with lysis buffer, magnetic beads, and diagnostic samples to allow viral RNA binding - total well volume of 171ul; (d) collect the beads from each well from the initial viral RNA binding step and allow 2 minutes for capture;  (d) transfer and release the beads into to a plate with the wash solution I and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds - total well volume of 100ul; (e) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution I step and allow 1 minute for capture;    (f) transfer and release the beads into a plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds - total well volume of 100ul; (g) collect the beads from each well from the wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (h) transfer and release the beads into a second plate with wash solution II and allow to incubate and gently mix for 30 seconds - total well volume of 100ul; (i) collect the beads from each well from the second wash solution II step and allow 1 minute for capture; (j) allow the beads to dry for 2-5 minutes by shaking in open air; (k) transfer and release the beads into a final plate with the elution buffer solution and allow to incubate with gentle mixing for 4 minutes - total well volume of 50ul; (l) collect the beads from each well from the final elution step and allow 2 minutes for capture; (m) discard the beads and protective magnetic rod coverings into a separate container.

05 Sep 2006/ QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

QUESTION:
Because the amount is predicated on the number of each test ordered, what figures are you looking for in the amount fields and is there a listing of the volume of each test?

ANSWER:
The government needs to have ALL the tests on the price list available.  And there is no guessing on how many, because government never knows when they?ll be needed.  Histology also has to be included.

QUESTION:
There are no volumes specified for any of the tests. Also the government has some tests listed that would require the provision of a pathologist and equipment on the hospitals site to actually perform, i.e. Frozen Section (two items) and or Consultation and Fine Needle Aspirate, Immediate Interpretation. And that these are procedures performed in a hospital requiring a pathologist to be in attendance.

ANSWER:
it is impossible for the government to quantify how many samples will be sent to a reference laboratory because the need for testing is based on several factors outside the control of the laboratory.  For example, if one of our doctors needs a test results STAT and we routinely send it to a military reference laboratory we will send to a local reference laboratory instead for analysis.  The government requires a cost for each test and utilize the services on an as needed basis

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent? for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  ?Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued.  This solicitation number is NIH-NIDDK-06-997 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 621511 and the business size standard is $11.5 M.  This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business.  It is the intent of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Fogarty International Center (FIC) is participating in the Diplomacy Fellows Program from the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).

Scope of Work

The Fogarty International Center (FIC) promotes and supports scientific research, training and capacity-building internationally to reduce disparities in global health.  To accomplish this broad objective, FIC works with the U.S. scientific community and counterparts abroad; U.S. agencies, including the State Department and other agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services; international organizations; and non-governmental groups.  FIC funds research, training and capacity building programs to advance critical initiatives on HIV/AIDS, emerging infectious diseases, medical informatics, maternal and child health, environmental health and other key issues, and supports multi-disciplinary research programs on topics such as the linkage between health status and economic development and international bioethics.

The AAAS administers the Science & Technology Policy Fellowships program in six areas to provide the opportunity for accomplished scientists and engineers to participate in and contribute to the public policymaking process of the Federal government.  The AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships enable competitively selected scientists and engineers to learn first hand about the use of science and technology in government decision making while offering valuable contributions of their knowledge and analytical skills to federal agencies and congressional offices.  Fellows bring fresh perspectives, new insights and extensive knowledge and education in a variety of disciplines, along with a desire to learn about policymaking that enables them to function at a high level from the start.

AAAS currently partners with nearly a dozen federal agencies, with congressional offices and committees, and with nearly 30 professional scientific societies to operate the AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships, which have been providing public policy education and outreach experiences for scientists and engineers for more than 30 years.  The AAAS Fellowships help to establish and nurture critical links between federal decision makers and scientific professionals to support public policy that benefits the wellbeing of the nation and the planet.  The result is a current network of more than 1,800 former Fellows who are more articulate and knowledgeable about conducting and communicating their science to support policy at national and international levels, and more effective in leadership roles in the public and policy arenas as well as in academia, industry and the non-profit sectors.

The overall goal of the AAAS Fellowships is to generate policy-savvy scientists and engineers, who can conduct research, teach, communicate, and apply their expertise within a policy context to better support international, federal, state and local policy efforts and the broader public.  The overarching aim is to increase the capacity of scientists to inform the discussions and decisions of individuals and institutions that influence or determine policies.

Current and future cohorts of Fellows create a growing network to increase outcomes and to mentor a new generation of leaders with the skills to communicate and apply science to enhance public understanding of technological issues and support improved policy.  This can happen through the education and outreach efforts of those who return to academia and teach undergraduates, graduates and post-docs, and by those who transition into government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and industry and take leadership roles applying and communicating science.

AAAS recruits candidates from a broad array of backgrounds and a diversity of geographic, disciplinary, gender, and ethnic perspectives.  Fellows come from a range of sectors, including academia, industry and NGOs.

Building on more than 30 years of experience, AAAS organizes and manages the Science & Technology Policy Fellowships in consultation with program officers at the partnering agencies.  Implementation of the AAAS Fellowships involves five main areas of activity annually:  promotion and recruitment, selection and placement, financial support and services, professional development, and monitoring and reporting.

The AAAS Science & Technology Policy Fellowships are extremely competitive, involving a formal, three-tier merit review and selection process.  The finalists are judged on their educational and professional credentials and references, demonstrated competence in a specific area of science or engineering, ability to communicate effectively, both orally and in writing, and leadership potential.  The focus is to select the best scientists and engineers from the applicant pool, as well as those whose experiences and interests fit with the mission of hosting agencies and offices.

The placement process involves interviews between finalists and partner agency potential host offices to explore compatibility between projects, expertise and interests.  This is followed by matching finalists with offices and issuing offer letters to confirm final assignments.

The AAAS Fellowships Department conducts a year-long professional development program that includes an eight-day orientation, monthly seminars, career-enhancement sessions, skill-building workshops, networking events, and an annual retreat.  The Fellowships Department also maintains a database and list servers, and coordinates alumni events that enable Fellows to interact and network during and beyond their fellowships.  The activities help to enhance the Fellows? knowledge and capabilities, and also to foster interaction and collaborative connections within and beyond the fellowship cohorts.

The FIC has participated in the past in the AAAS Diplomacy Fellows component of the program, which began in 1980 in the Department of State.  The FIC considers the program to be very significant in achieving its mission of training of future international policy makers.  The Fellow will work with a community of researchers, administrators and policy-makers at FIC, to advance medical research, training and capacity-building through international cooperation.  The Fellows will be placed in the Division of International Epidemiology and Population Studies (DIEPS).  The Fellow will also contribute to program, policy, and priority-setting efforts.

The AAAS fellow will work in the DIEPS on issues related to the interpretation of genomic, epidemiology and immunology data integrated with mathematical models and economic data to provide a basis for policy in the control of infectious diseases.  The primary focus is on vaccine preventable diseases, diarrhea and enteric infections and malaria.  The work of DIEPS has contributed to the decision making process at multi-lateral organizations such as the WHO, World Bank and Unicef and helped to inform national policies in the U.S. and a number of other nations, especially in regard to the control of influenza.  The AAAS fellow will have the opportunity to work with DIEPS investigators to synthesize and write papers that are policy relevant in the field of international public health.  The fellow will also have the opportunity to travel and present the work at international forums.

AAAS in uniquely qualified to manage and administer the Science & Technology Policy Fellowships.  Established in 1848, it is the world?s largest federation of scientific and engineering societies, with some 120,000 members.  Its 260+ affiliated organizations span all fields of the biological and physical sciences, social sciences and engineering.  The Science & Technology Policy Fellowships have grown from one program with seven Fellows in 1973, to nearly a dozen current agency partnerships with annual cohorts of approximately 130 Fellows.  AAAS manages Science & Technology Policy Fellowships in six thematic program areas:

?	Congressional
?	Diplomacy
?	Energy, Environment & Natural Resources
?	Global Stewardship
?	Health, Education & Human Services
?	National Defense & Global Security

Over the past 33 years, AAAS Fellowships have earned an impressive reputation, attracting significant interest from talented scientists across the country.  AAAS currently receives more than 400 qualified applications annually for the approximately 85 fellowship slots that it administers across the six program areas (an additional 30 Congressional Fellows are selected via partner scientific societies).

The CCR can be accessed at Internet address: www.ccr.gov/.  C onfirmation of CCR registration will be validated prior to awarding a contract.  Evaluation Factors:  Technical Capability, Past Performance, and Price.  Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than Price.    Provide the following information with your offer:  1. Technical Capability.  If providing an equal, please comply with FAR Clause 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal.  NOTE:  Statements that the offeror understands, can or will comply with all specifications , or statements paraphrasing the specifications or parts thereof, or phrases such as standard procedures will be used or well known techniques will be used will be considered insufficient.  Insufficient explanations of how your company will comply with the  above of this solicitation may cause your quote to receive a MARGINAL or UNSATISFACTORY rating.  2. Past Performance.  Vendors are required to provide Past Performance Questionnaires (attachments to this solicitation) to two firms/entities for which they are currently or have recently provided the same or similar supplies and/or equipment.  Provide with your quote, the company names, telephone numbers, and points of contact that will provide the completed questionnaires for your quote.  If a vendor provide s more than two past performance references, the Contracting Officer will consider only the first two listed references in the award decision.  It is the vendors responsibility to ensure past performance references submit completed questionnaires directly  to the Great Plains Regional Contracting Office (see below) by the solicitation closing date and time.  The Contracting Officer may also consider any additional past performance information that is available to the Government.  Vendors are reminded that w hile the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of providing thorough and complete past performance information rests with the vendor. 3. Price.  4. Award will be on an all or none basis.  Evaluation Process:  All quo tes will be evaluated in accordance with the following criteria:  1. Each vendor will be evaluated on its overall Past Performance under existing or prior contracts for the same or similar supplies and/or equipment as well as Technical Capability.  Pricin g will be evaluated to determine value offered for the price and the extent to which it is fair and reasonable in terms of the Governments requirement.  The Government reserves the right to evaluate quoted prices on the basis of price realism and will con sider quoted prices as an indication of understanding the scope and complexity of the Governments requirement.  2.  The award decision will be based on the Best Value offered to the Government and not solely on price and price related factors.  In making the award decision, the Contracting Officer will consider the evaluated rating of all factors.  3. Technical Capability and Past Performance are equal in importance.  Technical Capability and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more importan t than Price.  Price could become the determinative selection factor if the quality of quotes is determined to be essentially equal, or if a quote deemed superi or in technical quality is determined not to be worth the high price premium.  The trade-off between technical merit and price could result in awarding to other than the low offeror.
