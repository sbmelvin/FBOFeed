<DESC>NOTE:  The purpose of this Presolicitation Notice is to correct the Presolicitation Number from W91QUZ-12-R-52MD to W91QUZ-12-R-0014.  <br><br>The United States Army Contracting Command, National Capital Region intends to award a 12-month Cost Plus Fixed-Fee type contract with one 12-month option period on a non-competitive basis to Harris Corporation of Melbourne, FL under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, for the procurement of ongoing sustainment and support services for the AN/GSC-52 Modernization (52 Mod) Program's family of Satellite Communications (SATCOM) Earth Terminals (AN/GSC-52A(V), AN/GSC-39C and D, AN/FSC-78C(V) and AN/TSC-86A, C, D, E and F) and associated equipment. The contract will include systems engineering, integration efforts, system testing, documentation, and depot maintenance support. The 52 Mod Program's family of SATCOM Earth Terminals are part of the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) and Wideband Global System (WGS), which provide global wideband satellite communications for the DoD and other US Government agencies. These Earth Terminals provide highly reliable communications and interfaces with compatible Super High Frequency (SHF) terminals connecting to the DSCS/WGS constellation. The AN/GSC-52 Family of Modernized SATCOM Earth Terminals also provides pre-positioned Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) services for tactical users, as well as strategic communications support at fixed locations. This allows for the extension of DISN services such as secure and non-secure voice, video, and data capabilities to the deployed Soldiers.<br><br>The contractor shall provide engineering, software and logistics support and services to ensure successful sustainment of the 52 Mod Program's family of SATCOM Earth Terminals and affiliated subsystems during the sustainment phase of the AN/GSC-52 Modernization Program. The contractor shall provide logistics management support, logistics analyses, changes and updates to engineering and technical documentation, including Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) and Repair Parts and Special Tools Lists (RPSTL), engineering services, telephonic and on-site technical assistance, sustainment training, painting, and corrosion control services.<br><br>The contractor shall continue developing the required Replacement Radio Frequency Interconnecting Subsystem (RRFIS) tuning procedures inherently tied to the functions and capabilities of the 52 Mod equipment. Successful sustainment, inclusive of implementation and enhancement of RRFIS, depends upon detailed technical knowledge of the existing RRFIS design and access to drawings and software code being written by the contractor which is unique to RRFIS production models. Another contractor would not be capable of meeting the established MILCON and satellite launch schedules and maintaining the associated software. <br><br>The contractor shall continue modification of the modem components, developed by the contractor as part of the Anti-Scintillation Modem, and integrate the upgraded modem components as part of the Protected Anti-Jam Anti-Scintillation Wideband Net-Centric Modem (PAAWNS). This will provide additional capabilities when integrated with the High-altitude Electro-Magnetic Pulse (HEMP) protected AN/GSC-52 terminals to satisfy the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) requirements for protected satellite communications in perturbed environments.<br><br>Harris Corporation is the only known source with the specialized experience, skills, operational familiarity, and Technical Data Package needed to perform the required services. The AN/GSC-52 SATCOM Earth Terminals were modernized with a common suite of electronics components and subsystems through the AN/GSC-52 Modernization Program. Harris produced the modernized AN/GSC-52A(V) SATCOM terminals.<br><br>The NACIS code for this procurement is 811213 with the corresponding small business size standard of $10 million. The estimated award date is 26 March 2012. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Questions may be addressed to Jennifer Johnson, Contracting Officer (e-mail jennifer.d.johnson1.civ@mail.mil) or Edie Reisberg, Contract Specialist (e-mail eda.m.reisberg.civ@mail.mil) or Giorgiana Chen, Contract Specialist (e-mail giorgiana.chen.civ@mail.mil). <br>

<DESC>Solicitation SPM2DE-12-R-0004 is a standing solicitation from which the Government contemplates multiple awards of contracts for items as described below. This solicitation is a follow-on to solicitation SP0200-01-R-5011.<br /><br />The Medical Supply Chain at DLA Troop Support has developed a DLA Laboratory Electronic Catalog (ECAT) solicitation to support Contiguous United States (CONUS) and Outside Contiguous United States (OCONUS) customer demand for laboratory supplies and wares, equipment, repair parts for items already in the Medical Laboratory ECAT Program, as well as incidental services. This solicitation is being issued as part of DLA's Multiple Award Schedule program in accordance with procedures of FAR part 8.4 and DFARS 208.4. DLA's Multiple Award Schedule program is designed to provide logistic support empowering customers to select the products best meeting mission needs using best value ordering procedures. The objective of this procurement initiative is to invite prospective laboratory vendors to participate in DLA's Laboratory ECAT Program, while at the same time offer existing vendors with expiring contracts the opportunity to submit new proposals. This solicitation will support CONUS and OCONUS Government customers. The DLA Electronic Catalog will be the sole means by which orders will be placed, confirmed and invoiced under this contract. <br />This solicitation will replace an existing solicitation (SP0200-01-R-5011) for medical laboratory equipment, supplies and wares. Items that may be purchased under this program encompass commercial items required for use in a laboratory; including but not limited to laboratory supplies, wares, equipment, and repair parts for laboratory end items already included under a Laboratory Program contract. The program may also provide incidental services associated with laboratory items.<br />This acquisition intends to award multiple contracts to all responsive manufacturers and dealers who can meet the requirements of the solicitation and provided fair and reasonable prices. Offerors are required to submit discounted prices from their commercial catalogs for various laboratory items for ECAT. This solicitation will result in an indefinite-delivery indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) base year contract with four one-year option periods. This solicitation will be standing for five years after the issuance date. <br />The Laboratory ECAT Program is voluntary for DLA Customers who have the option to source the same items through other contracts or outside of DLA. As a result, there will be no guarantee of sales or specific demand outside of the guaranteed minimum dollar value that is established for each contract. To be successful under this program; the vendor will need to market the program to DLA customers, establish supplier relationships, offer competitive pricing to other Government contracts and commercial sources, provide superior customer support and ensure a product offering that can satisfy most customer requests. Failure to do any of these tasks could result in minimal or no sales.<br />The first open season due date shall be on March 1, 2012; followed by solicitation closings on the last business day of each month until an Amendment ending open seasons is issued or five years after the first open season, whichever comes first. Offers must be received by 3:00 pm, EST, on the day of closing.<br />Fast Pay Applies for delivery orders up to a value of $100,000.00. Prompt Pay shall apply for all orders above $100,000.00. There is an add/delete provision that will allow for addition of new items as long as they meet the contract scope, contract terms and conditions, and can be determined to be fair and reasonable. Pricing will be adjusted through Economic Price Adjustment (EPA) provisions. Orders must be confirmed within 24 hours. Orders that cannot be filled will count against the vendor fill rate. A minimum of 90% of orders must be filled under the contract. Vendors must maintain a 90% On-time Delivery rate. <br />Items must weigh no more than 300 lbs., when packaged, to be included in an OCONUS catalog. OCONUS pricing must be offered on a FOB Origin basis with the Government picking the material up at the vendor facility. OCONUS orders must be ready for pickup by the Government within 3 days for routine/regular orders, 15 days for special order items and 45 days for assemblies/systems. <br />CONUS and Alaska/Hawaii orders must be offered on a FOB Destination basis.<br />The required delivery shall be as follows for the three destination categories:<br />Contiguous United States (CONUS): The 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia:<br />Routine/Regular: delivery within 3 days <br />Special Orders: delivery within 15 days <br />Equipment Type - Routine/Regular: delivery within 30 days <br />Equipment Type - Special Orders: delivery within 45 days

STATEMENT OF WORK:
INTRODUCTION 
In October of 2011, to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty, Earth Cam, an internet based construction monitoring service based in New Jersey, donated and installed camera equipment on the Statue's torch for real time recording and transmission via the internet of images of New York Harbor, Ellis Island, the grounds of Liberty Island, and the torch itself.  Earth Cam also designed the web pages for display of what is now known as the Torch Cam (see below).  However, the company does not have the capability to broadcast this material over the internet. That must be done by, an internet service provider, which is the purpose of this requisition.
The Torch Cam was donated through the Statue of Liberty - Ellis Island Foundation. Since October 28th, when the Torch Cam went "live," four months of internet service were also donated, which will be up at the end of February, 2012.
Torch Cam has been extremely popular with the public and has become a useful tool in promoting the park and its programs, as well as the fundraising activities of our partners. It is an integral component of our New- and Social-Media program, and an efficient mean of connecting with underserved audiences. A similar effort is in place at the Flight 93 Memorial in Pennsylvania, and has been proposed for the Washington Monument. Activities such as this are supportive of the Director's Call to Action.

<a href="mailto:rose.brenner@navy.miL">POINT OF CONTACT </a>
<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/ and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at https://www.neco.navy.mil/  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. 
The Government intends to award a 5-year Firm Fixed Price (FFP) Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Miniature Day/Night Sight  Crew Served Weapons (MDNS-CSW) Fire Control System (FCS) for the M2, MK19, MK44 and MK47 CSW.
   The FCS is to be manufactured in accordance with (IAW) the technical data package. It is anticipated that two contracts will result from this effort: an Integrated approach and a Modular approach.  The anticipated Min/Max of FCS for the Integrated approach is 2/194. The anticipated Min/Max of FCS for the Modular approach is 2/1,050.

The Government anticipates the Fire Control System will consist of six functional subsystems: Flat Panel Display (FPD), Ballistics Processor Module (BPM), Advanced Enhanced Combat Optical Sight  Heavy (Advanced ECOS-H), Clip On Night Vision Device  Heavy (CNVD-H), Laser Range Finder (LRF), Remote Control Module (RCM), and necessary cables.   In the Integrated approach, the contractor will integrate their own LRF and CNVD.
  In the Modular approach, the LRF and CNVD are supplied as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) after the contract has been awarded.  

A quantity of two product samples will be required and must be furnished as part of the offer (four if proposing on both approaches).  If submitting on the Modular approach, the product samples must work on the M2, and a white paper must be submitted on how the vendor will meet the MK44 and MK47 requirements.  If submitting on the Integrated approach, the product samples must work on the MK47, and a white paper must be submitted on how the vendor will meet the M2 and MK47 requirements.  In addition, there will be line items for replacement spare parts, data, training, and for engineering services support.
 

The solicitation will be open for 60 days.  Since GFE may not be readily available from the commercial marketplace for some vendors to develop/integrate their FCS, the Government will allow a two-day visit to NSWC Crane to physically view the GFE, see the GFE function, and ask questions about the GFE.  Interested vendors must provide an Intent to Submit letter within 15 days after the solicitation issue date to receive a site visit.  If the Intent to Submit letter is received later than 15 days from solicitation issue date, a site visit will not be allowed.  Instructions for the site-visit will be in the solicitation.  After award, the successful offeror will be supplied with the stated GFE for the Modular approach.
  Again, the site visit is to view GFE only.  It will not be supplied until the contract has been awarded.  

Government Furnished Information (GFI) will be provided to Offerors who request it.  Instructions on how to obtain the GFI will be included in the solicitation. 

Delivery shall be FOB Destination.  Inspection shall be Origin, and Acceptance shall be Destination.  Delivery for the initial order of the Integrated FCS will be 240 days after receipt of order.  Subsequent deliveries will be 180 days after issuance of orders.  Delivery for the initial order of the Modular FCS will be 180 days after receipt of order.  Subsequent deliveries will be 120 days after issuance of orders. 

This acquisition is a full and open competition and all responsible offerors may submit an offer that will be considered.
  The contract(s) will be awarded to the responsible Offeror(s) whose offer is the best value to the Government, considering Technical, Past Performance, and Price evaluation factors, as described in the solicitation.  

Contractors must be properly registered in the Government's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and in the Joint Certification Program (JCP) in order to receive the solicitation attachments.  Offerors may obtain information on CCR registration and annual confirmation requirements via https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/contractors.aspx .  Information about the JCP is located at http://www.dlis.dla.mil/JCP/.  The solicitation attachments will be posted to FedBizOpps at the same time the solicitation is posted.
  FedBizOpps may be accessed at http://www.fbo.gov.

All changes to the requirement that occur prior to the closing date will be posted to FedBizOpps and NECO.  It is the responsibility of interested vendors to monitor FedBizOpps and NECO for amendments that may be issued to this solicitation.  For changes made after the closing date, only those offerors that provide a proposal will be provided any changes/amendments and considered for future discussions and/or award.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  Interested sources must download the solicitation and the technical data package from the www site listed.  The contact for this procurement is Ms R Brenner, Code CXMLND, at telephone 812-854-8827, Fax 812-854-5095 or e-mail: rose.brenner@navy.mil .

<DESC>The proposed action is for 5 summer interns resulting from the utilization of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities National Intern (HACU) Program in support of the Naval Supply Systems Command, Mechanicsburg, PA. It is expected that the 5 interns will be employed for the period from 4 June through 25 August 2012 at the following locations: 1837 Morris Street, Norfolk, VA 23511; GLS, 937 North Harbor Drive, San Diego, CA  92132-5026; WSS, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia, PA  19111 and any NAVSUP activity located at 5450 Carlisle Pike, Mechanicsburg, PA. Interns will provide management support to the supervisor, analyst, specialist and/or other management assistants in the development, implementation and maintenance of plans, programs and procedures relating to functions of the organizational unit.
  Assist higher grade analysts/specialists in the conduct of comprehensive surveys by performing various fact-finding and research tasks.  Research, gather and perform routine analysis of specific management data from prescribed sources. Participate in discussions and meetings relative to projects and assignments and monitors project/survey progress. 

Using Simplified Acquisition Procedures, under FAR Part 13.1, the Government intends to solicit only one source, the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU). HACU has been determined to be the only source for this Government requirement. The Executive Order 13171, signed October 12, 2000 established policy to increase Hispanic employment in the federal government.
  All executive branches, including Department of Defense, were directed to develop and maintain a program for the recruitment of Hispanics in Federal employment.  Each agency was to implement the goals of the Government-wide Hispanic Employment Initiatives issued by the Office of Personnel Managements (OPM) Nine Point Plan.  The Plan encourages Federal agencies to participate in the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU) National Internship Program. HACU is the only known source that, through an existing agreement with DOD, can utilize known workforce information to assist their member institutions in developing and implanting curricula and other career development programs to teach and train students for careers in business, national security, science and technology.
 HACU provides diverse, well qualified students. In addition, HACU maintains a ready database of diverse intern resumes immediately available for selection to support summer intern requirements. Furthermore, HACU provides local housing support based on an evaluation background checks. They have the resources in place to research the area to locate housing that is safe and reliable, fully furnished, have laundry facilities and are from reliable, local individuals that are willing to accept a short term lease for the duration of the program.  

This is not a request for quotes. Interested persons may identify their capability to provide the required summer interns. Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
 A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. However all capability information received by 12 PM (local time) on 13 February 2012 will be considered by the Government. All responses may be emailed to gomati.poonai@navy.mil. The Government will not pay for information received. For additional information concerning this requirement, please contact Gomati Poonai at gomati.poonai@navy.mil or 215-697-9577.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with the Cape Cod Cooperative Extension (CCCE), to establish, maintain, and activate/deactivate 4-Poster deer stations and conduct seasonal sampling for black-legged deer tick adults and nymphs on Cape Cod and the Islands.  The Cape Cod Cooperative Extension (CCCE) has the equipment and infrastructure to do the extensive field collection work over 9 sites across multiple counties on the Cape, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket.  CCCE also has permission and permits from private landowners to conduct these field collections.   The EPA would be leveraging 3 years of data already collected by CCCE using the same study design.  These longitudinal time-series data are rare among these studies.  The ability to continue deployment at the exact locations where the previous deployments occurred is a critical requirement for this work and is a critical aspect of quality control.  Cape Cod C ooperative Extension is the only responsible source to do this work because the sampling protocol, property owner permissions for the study locations, and required wildlife permits from the State of Massachusetts were uniquely developed by or issued to Cape Cod Cooperative Extension.  Therefore, EPA believes this is the only vendor capable of providing the data needed by this project.  The circumstance permitting is FAR 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements?.  The anticipated period of performance is a 24 month base period.  All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities and qualifications in writing within 15 days from the date of this announcement and provide itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solic itation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, anyone failing to provide the aforementioned and instead chooses to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the statement of work or more information about the project will be ignored.  The information received to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: Sammie Jones (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, 109 Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.  No telephone or faxed requests will be honored.

<DESC>Advances in solid state and vacuum electronics technology, combined with growing spectral congestion, are encouraging exploitation of increasingly higher frequency bands and utilizing broader bandwidths for active sensors/imagers, high data rate terrestrial and satellite communications links, and electronic warfare (EW) receivers/transmitters. Many solid state device technologies have achieved significant advances in speed, output power, linearity, noise figure and maturity up through microwave frequencies and into the millimeter wave (MMW) regime that enable capabilities in high capacity communications, high resolution sensors, and wideband EW. While the technology advances have led to significant performance gains in front-end amplifier and mixer technologies, the RF signal conditioning technology has not seen similar progress.

<p><br />This procurement is an IDIQ Contract for asbestos abatement and mold remediation in government-owned buildings; GSA controlled or leased buildings in various counties/parishes in Region 7 East. The asbestos abatement and mold remediation IDIQ contract is for a period of one (1) year from Notice to Proceed, with four 1-year options, not to exceed five years. The maximum ordering limitation is up to $1,000,000 per year. The guaranteed minimum is $1,000 for the base year ONLY. A bid guarantee will be required in the amount of $200,000. The successful firm will be required to support all locations within Region 7 East. The successful firm shall have the capability to perform asbestos abatement and mold remediation services work at several sites simultaneously and handle large projects in Region 7 East. It is possible to have more than one project in progress at any one given time or location within that area during the term of the contract. Contractors shall have the capability to respond rapidly on an emergency as-needed basis.</p>
<p>The asbestos abatement and mold remediation services includes all abatement and remediation activities, but may require the contractor to conduct site surveys, provide determination for confirmation of asbestos/mold scope of work on-site, take bulk samples of suspected asbestos containing materials (i.e. ACM), and prepare reports on the results of the site surveys. Projects will primarily involve asbestos abatement and mold remediation, but may also include selective demolition. The successful firm shall have a minimum of five (5) years experience as licensed asbestos and mold contractor in at least one or more of the following states: Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. All work performed under this contract shall be performed by licensed asbestos/mold parties (either a prime contractor and/or key subcontractor) that is licensed in the state and/or municipality in which the work is to be performed. Proof of licensing and of the requisite experience will be verified prior to awarding a contract, or any delivery order issued under the contract.</p>
<p>The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a); therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer (CO) later determines them to be necessary. The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the offeror. The Government may also consider the offeror's performance on contracts not submitted by the offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of.</p>
<p>The offerors must provide an environmental impact plan that addresses how they plan to reduce the environmental impact of the products and services provided during performance of the resultant contract. The offerors should address the following topics, if applicable, in their Environmental Impact Plan:<br />&bull; Ongoing Consumable Products<br />&bull; Durable Good Products<br />&bull; Facility Alteration and Addition Base Building Element Products<br />&bull; Cleaning Equipment Products<br />&bull; Cleaning Supply Products<br />&bull; Concession Products<br />&bull; Other Green Products<br />&bull; Use of Green Transportation/Meetings<br />&bull; Voluntary Green Consensus Standards/Product Certifications<br />&bull; Use of Recycled Materials<br />&bull; Plan to Minimize, Reuse, or Recycle Project Materials<br />&bull; Additional Miscellaneous Green Practices</p>
<p>In addressing each category, the offerors must describe how their plan will meet the scope of work requirements and whether their approach will reduce the environmental impact beyond the requirements of the scope of work. The offeror that proposes green products and services beyond the requirements of the scope of work that will likely reduce the overall environmental impact of the project will be evaluated higher.</p>
<p>The offerors must identify up to three (3) projects similar in size, scope, and complexity where they have implemented green products and services during the performance of a project that reduced the environmental impact of the project. For each project, the offerors must provide the following information: <br />&bull; Dollar value of the prime contracts<br />&bull; Date of contracts start and completion, including options<br />&bull; Type of contracts (firm fixed price, incentive fee, time and materials, etc.)<br />&bull; Description of the green products and services implemented and how they reduced the environmental impact of the projects<br />&bull; Name, title, address, and current telephone number of the building's owner or a representative of the owner who can attest to the acceptability of the services provided</p>
<p>The offerors will be evaluated based on how well they will successfully implement green products and services required in the contracts. Offerors shall be evaluated higher on a project where the offeror's implementation of green products and services reduced the environmental impact of the project beyond the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p>The offerors must provide up to two (2) references for each project listed. For each reference, the contractor must include the reference's name, title, project, email address, and telephone number. If no references are provided for a project, that project will not be evaluated. The government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained.</p>
<p>In addition, the government may consider the offeror's past performance on any other relevant contract within the past five (5) years, of which the government has knowledge or becomes aware of as a result of references or other means.</p>
<p>This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using FAR Part 15.3, Source Selection Procedures, which will result in the award of a firm-fixed price contract. Technical abilities shall be significantly more important than price. Offerors will be evaluated in the following order: (1) Environmental impact plan; (2) Experience and past performance of prime contractor and key subcontractors; (2) Experience, past performance and qualifications of key personnel; (3) Management/technical approach.</p>
<p>Offerors will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses. The Government furnished line item listing in this contract will be the primary ordering source. If the awarded firm refuses to accept work for any line item included in a task order issued under this IDIQ contract the government will deem this to be a material breach of the contract and may terminate the contract for cause, without additional expense to the government. Any documents related to this procurement will be available via the Internet only. No hard copies will be available. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of all documents. These documents will be in .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) format and will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about February 23, 2012. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any.

The asbestos abatement and mold remediation IDIQ contract is for a period of one (1) year from Notice to Proceed, with four 1-year options, not to exceed five years. The maximum ordering limitation is up to $1,000,000 per year. The guaranteed minimum is $1,000 for the base year ONLY. A bid guarantee will be required in the amount of $200,000. The successful firm will be required to support all locations within Region 7 West. The successful firm shall have the capability to perform asbestos abatement and mold remediation services work at several sites simultaneously and handle large projects in Region 7 West. It is possible to have more than one project in progress at any one given time or location within that area during the term of the contract. Contractors shall have the capability to respond rapidly on an emergency as-needed basis.</p>
<p>The asbestos abatement and mold remediation services includes all abatement and remediation activities, but may require the contractor to conduct site surveys, provide determination for confirmation of asbestos/mold scope of work on-site, take bulk samples of suspected asbestos containing materials (i.e. ACM), and prepare reports on the results of the site surveys.

All work performed under this contract shall be performed by licensed asbestos/mold parties (either a prime contractor and/or key subcontractor) that is licensed in the state and/or municipality in which the work is to be performed. Proof of licensing and of the requisite experience will be verified prior to awarding a contract, or any delivery order issued under the contract.</p>
<p>The Government may or may not hold discussions on technical proposals (except clarifications as described in FAR 15.306(a); therefore, the offeror's proposal should contain the offeror's best terms from a technical standpoint. The Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Contracting Officer (CO) later determines them to be necessary. The Government is not limited to contacting only those references provided by the offeror. The Government may also consider the offeror's performance on contracts not submitted by the offeror that the Government is aware of, or becomes aware of.</p>
<p>The offerors must provide an environmental impact plan that addresses how they plan to reduce the environmental impact of the products and services provided during performance of the resultant contract. The offerors should address the following topics, if applicable, in their Environmental Impact Plan:<br />&bull; Ongoing Consumable Products<br />&bull; Durable Good Products<br />&bull; Facility Alteration and Addition Base Building Element Products<br />&bull; Cleaning Equipment Products<br />&bull; Cleaning Supply Products<br />&bull; Concession Products<br />&bull; Other Green Products<br />&bull; Use of Green Transportation/Meetings<br />&bull; Voluntary Green Consensus Standards/Product Certifications<br />&bull; Use of Recycled Materials<br />&bull; Plan to Minimize, Reuse, or Recycle Project Materials<br />&bull; Additional Miscellaneous Green Practices</p>
<p>In addressing each category, the offerors must describe how their plan will meet the scope of work requirements and whether their approach will reduce the environmental impact beyond the requirements of the scope of work. The offeror that proposes green products and services beyond the requirements of the scope of work that will likely reduce the overall environmental impact of the project will be evaluated higher.</p>
<p>The offerors must identify up to three (3) projects similar in size, scope, and complexity where they have implemented green products and services during the performance of a project that reduced the environmental impact of the project. For each project, the offerors must provide the following information: <br />&bull; Dollar value of the prime contracts<br />&bull; Date of contracts start and completion, including options<br />&bull; Type of contracts (firm fixed price, incentive fee, time and materials, etc.)<br />&bull; Description of the green products and services implemented and how they reduced the environmental impact of the projects<br />&bull; Name, title, address, and current telephone number of the building's owner or a representative of the owner who can attest to the acceptability of the services provided</p>
<p>The offerors will be evaluated based on how well they will successfully implement green products and services required in the contracts. Offerors shall be evaluated higher on a project where the offeror's implementation of green products and services reduced the environmental impact of the project beyond the requirements of the contract.</p>
<p><br />The offerors must provide up to two (2) references for each project listed. For each reference, the contractor must include the reference's name, title, project, email address, and telephone number. If no references are provided for a project, that project will not be evaluated. The government is not required to ensure that an equal number of references be obtained.</p>
<p>In addition, the government may consider the offeror's past performance on any other relevant contract within the past five (5) years, of which the government has knowledge or becomes aware of as a result of references or other means.</p>
<p>This negotiated procurement will be accomplished by using FAR Part 15.3, Source Selection Procedures, which will result in the award of a firm-fixed price contract. Technical abilities shall be significantly more important than price. Offerors will be evaluated in the following order: (1) Environmental impact plan; (2) Experience and past performance of prime contractor and key subcontractors; (2) Experience, past performance and qualifications of key personnel; (3) Management/technical approach.</p>
<p>Offerors will not be reimbursed for proposal submittal expenses. The Government furnished line item listing in this contract will be the primary ordering source. If the awarded firm refuses to accept work for any line item included in a task order issued under this IDIQ contract the government will deem this to be a material breach of the contract and may terminate the contract for cause, without additional expense to the government. Any documents related to this procurement will be available via the Internet only. No hard copies will be available. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of all documents. These documents will be in .pdf (Adobe Acrobat) format and will be available at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about February 23, 2012. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this site for the release of any information or documents in the special notices, the solicitation and amendments, if any. Offerors can also register to be notified by e-mail of new postings including synopsis, solicitations, and amendments at the site.

A specific time and location will be issued with the solicitation. Attendance at the pre-proposal conference is not mandatory.</p>

Updated information will be provided in a subsequent notice or synopsis, if and when necessary.<br>COMPLETENESS:  When the Government solicits for jacks it is the intent and requirement of the Government to acquire completely assembled and readily usable jacks.  It is the bidder's or contractor's responsibility to bring to the attention of the Government's Contracting Officer such incompatibilities or omissions of equipment that would seem incongruous or prevent the jacks from being fully functional when received by the end user.  It is permissible to ship the jacks with the pump handles detached and packed in the same container as the jacks to reduce the volume of the shipping containers.  Jack handles shall be packed in the same container with the jacks they will be attached to and not be packed separately.  <br><br>DESIGN:   The jacks offered to the government shall meet all of the requirements of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Safety Standard for Portable Automotive Lifting Devices, PALD 2009 Part 7, entitled "Service Jacks" and all further requirements set forth in this specification.  In the event of a perceived conflict between the PALD standard and this requirement, this requirement shall take precedence.   (Jacks offered from different manufacturers and suppliers may have varying design characteristics such as two speed pumping mechanisms, single speed pumping mechanisms with foot pedals for rapid rise of the saddle to contact the load, air over hydraulic systems or any combination of the above.  Any offered design may be considered for acceptance based upon its demonstrated ability to meet all of the other requirements in this document.) <br><br>PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:  The following product requirements are in addition to those that are required by ANSI/ASME PALD Part 7.  <br><br>CHASSIS LENGTH:  The full length of the 4-ton chassis shall be not less than 47 inches, excluding the handle.  The full length of the 10-ton chassis shall not be less than 50 inches, excluding the handle.<br><br>LIFTING DISTANCE:  The 4-ton jack shall be capable of lifting the full rated load from its lowest position, at no higher than 5   inches (the saddle must be able to slide under an object where the clearance is no more than 5  inches), to its highest position, at no lower than 21 inches.  The 10-ton jack shall be capable of lifting the full rated load from its lowest position, at no higher than 7 inches (the saddle must be able to slide under an object where the clearance is no more than 7 inches), to its highest position, at no lower than 21 inches<br>                               <br>FORCE ON HANDLE:  The 4-ton load shall be lifted from the lowest position to the highest position with no more than 160 pounds of force applied at the "T" on the handle.  The 10-ton load hall be lifted from the lowest position to the highest position with no more than 180 pounds of force applied to the "T" on the handle.<br><br>HANDLE DESIGN:  The 4-ton pump handle shall be no more than 54 inches long from the pivot point to the "T" on the end of the handle.  A "T" on the handle is required.  The 10-ton pump handle shall be no more than 54 inches long from the pivot point to the "T" on the end of the handle.  A "T" on the handle is required.<br><br>HYDRAULIC FLUID:  Only hydraulic fluids that produce no adverse effects on health and for which no special precautions are required beyond attention to good personal hygiene such as washing with soap and water shall be used.  Two copies of a Material Safety Data Sheet for the hydraulic fluid shall be packed with the owner's manual for each jack.  The fluid used in the jack shall be a general purpose hydraulic fluid of ISO Viscosity grade 32 with anti-wear, oxidation resistance, a pour point at or below -40F and rust and corrosion protection.  The hydraulic fluids and seals shall be compatible with each other.  Fluids conforming to MIL-DTL-17111 will be acceptable as well. Aircraft grade fluids and fire retardant fluids are not required.  <br><br>HYDRAULIC FLUID LABELING:  The following message shall be applied in a permanent manner with large plain type near the filler plug(s) of the hydraulic fluid reservoir in such a position that it will be seen by anyone attempting to refill the reservoir.  The type shall either be dark on a light background or light on a dark background.  Fill in the name and type of hydraulic fluid that is used in the jack.<br><br>CAUTION<br>USE NO OTHER FLUID THAN<br>(Fill in your fluid identification here)<br> <br>OVERLOAD BYPASS VALVE:  The jacks shall incorporate a hydraulically activated overload protection system which is separate in design and operation from the load release system, is not externally adjustable by the user and which is located in the pump side of the hydraulic circuit such that it shall bypass hydraulic fluid from the pump to the reservoir when experiencing an overload on the saddle.  The valve shall be adjusted to operate at a load between 100% of the jack's rated load and 125% of the jack's rated load.  Since it is necessary to fill the reservoir with hydraulic fluid to set the bypass valve, the fluid can remain sealed in the reservoir for shipment. <br><br>LOAD RELEASE SYSTEM:  The hydraulic unit shall incorporate a manually activated and controlled hydraulic release system to permit controlled lowering and complete stopping, at any position of the saddle, when the saddle is either fully loaded or completely unloaded, throughout the entire range of saddle travel.  The load release system shall control the saddle's overall rate of descent to one foot per minute or slower throughout the full range of saddle travel, without stopping, while under full rated load.  The release system shall be controlled at the "T" or cross end of the handle.<br><br>HYDRAULIC OVER-TRAVEL BYPASS SYSTEM:  The hydraulic system shall incorporate a hydraulic fluid bypass to prevent over-travel of the lifting member after reaching its highest raised position.  Unlimited buildup of hydraulic pressure, after reaching the point of highest rise, will not be acceptable.<br><br>MANUALS AND OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS:  Two sets of Commercial manuals and operating instructions shall be over packed with each jack furnished.  The manuals and instructions shall be written in American English dialect and shall be printed in a clean and legible manner.  The manuals and operating instructions shall include safety, setup, operation, maintenance, and repair information, addresses of dealer/distributors that do repair work, and a list of replaceable parts with part numbers.  The manuals and operating instructions may be in the manufacturer's format and shall include the following information on the front cover. <br>       <br>a. The government's National Stock Number 4910-00-516-5806 (4-ton)/4910-00-289-7233 (10-ton).<br>b. The nomenclature of the jack.  Use "Jack, Dolly Type, Hydraulic, Automotive Service, 4-Ton" and "Jack, Dolly Type, Hydraulic, Automotive Service, 10-Ton" respectively.<br>c. The contract number under which the jack was sold.<br>d. The manufacturer's name and CAGE CODE.<br>e. The suppliers name, address and CAGE CODE if different from the manufacturer.<br>Appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets shall be provided with the manuals and operating instructions (see 3.3.5).<br><br>COPYRIGHT:  The owner of the copyrights shall extend copyrights for the manuals and operating instructions and spare parts lists to the Government and provide a letter to the Government's contracting officer to that effect.<br>       <br>ELECTRONIC COPIES OF MANUALS:  The owner of the copyright shall provide an electronic copy of the manuals that are over-packed with the jacks on a CD, in .pdf Adobe Acrobat format to the contracting officer, before the first shipment of the jacks.<br><br>RECLAIMED MATERIALS:  The manufacturer may use reclaimed materials for fabricating new parts.  Reclaimed materials shall be reprocessed, remanufactured, or recycled in a manner that restores them to the same chemical composition and physical properties as the virgin materials originally selected for use.  Use of reclaimed parts as is or rebuilt from scrap or other used equipment is not permitted.<br>       <br>DISSIMILAR METALS:  Appropriate measures as recommended by MIL-STD-889 shall be taken to prevent galvanic corrosion.<br>       <br>SPECIAL MARKINGS:  In addition to all of the marking required elsewhere in this specification, the jacks shall also be permanently marked with the following contract data:  <br>       <br>a.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement for acquisition planning purposes.  No formal solicitation for this work exists at this time.  The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) is seeking responsible sources having capability to provide environmentally compatible invasive quagga and zebra mussel control technology to treat the cooling and service water systems at Hoover, Davis, and Parker Dams (i.e., Lower Colorado River Dams (LCD)).  The product to be utilized will be discharged to the Colorado River as the cooling water and/or fire protection systems are not closed loop.  Reclamation is currently seeking firms that have proven expertise and ability to initiate this large scale biological control project and that have an extensive knowledge of mollusk including research and development of control systems and monitoring settlement.  Reclamation is seeking vendors to provide a comprehensive invasive mussel control solution that includes turn-key services necessary to support vendor selected technology.  The required services will depend on the selected technology, but must meet the minimum requirements outlined in this notice.
All eligible and qualified contractors may submit capability statements for consideration.  Capability statements received will be reviewed to determine the quantity and availability of contractors who have the technical level of expertise, administrative and management capability to perform the effort described below.  The capability statements received will be used to determine the Bureau of Reclamation's overall procurement strategy.
BACKGROUND  
Quagga mussels are aggressive biofouling organisms. Their aggressive nature stems from their ability to reproduce in large numbers, pass through all but the smallest filters, attach securely to most materials and quickly reach adult sized, 2 - 3 cm. On the Colorado River, researchers have shown that adult mussels grow faster on the Colorado River and have longer reproductive periods.  When present in the source of the cooling water, they become a serious problem for the cooling water systems of hydropower facilities using infested water unless defensive steps are taken. There are two main types of fouling, acute and chronic. Chronic fouling occurs when juvenile mussels attach themselves to external and internal structures such as piping, valves, filters etc.  The juvenile mussels grow in place and reduce or even cut off the water supply. 
Acute fouling occurs when large accumulations of adult mussel shells, both alive and dead, become detached from upstream locations and are carried by the water flow into piping systems.  The large quantities of mussel shells quickly plug small diameter pipes, strainers and filters. Such events can occur at unexpected times and, if not anticipated, can have rapid and significant negative consequences to equipment and systems, including; taking systems completely off line for repairs.
Quagga mussel infestation was first identified on the Colorado River in 2007.  Currently, there are no zebra mussels on the Colorado River; however, Reclamation desires a technology that can address both species in the event a zebra mussel infestation also occurs.  The LCD have identified that they want to implement a technology that can address both types of fouling, chronic and acute.  Due to the significance of the Colorado River as a vital water resource to all the western states, the only permissible mussel control options are those that do not have a significant negative impact to downstream water quality and the environment. 
The staff at the dams are not familiar with implementing invasive mussel control strategies nor do they have available staff to implement treatments; therefore LCD are interested in vendors that can provide a control program that includes both the technology and the necessary services to implement that technology.  
The anticipated flow rates per cooling water subsystem and the number of subsystems at each Dam is for reference only and the actual number of subsystems and flow will need to be confirmed when a treatment system is installed.
 -  Hoover  - 1500 gpm for 17 to 34 systems for cooling water; fire protection systems -  Davis - 4000 gpm for 5 systems -  Parker  - 1500 gpm for 4 systems PRINCIPAL FEATURES OF WORK   
The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment, materials, and supervision for invasive mussel control program for the selected technology.  The contractor bears the burden for ensuring that all legally required licenses and permits are obtained and renewed as specified by the regulating authority.  The control program must comply with the following requirements for Technology and Services.
TECHNOLOGY:
The technology must be environmentally compatible such that it poses minimal risk to fish and other aquatic non-target species while providing effective control of invasive mussels.
Solutions must be non-volatile and cannot require detoxification (or quenching) before discharge.
Solution must be non-corrosive and not require specialty non-corrosive materials for application.
During treatment periods, the discharge water must not have a significant impact to downstream water quality or produce residual disinfection by-products that may be problematic to downstream water users.
The technology must have minimal risk to people and require minimal personal protection equipment and/or require minimal OSHA safety requirements for both the applicators and Dam workers that may be working in the surrounding area. 
The technology must be applicable to a broad range of water conditions and not require shutdown due to high algae concentrations or volume of incoming aquatic weeds. 
The technology must mitigate issues of shell accumulation and concerns with shell debris and be able to address both types of fouling; acute and chronic.
The technology must be capable of being permitted for use by facilities on the Colorado River.
Technology and services cannot impact facility operations or services within the facility during treatments (e.g. require isolation of treatment areas such that workers cannot service a portion of the facility during chemical treatments).
SERVICES:
The contractor must provide the necessary system design implementation for each facility/Dam.
The contractor must be able to identify and interface with environmental regulators and obtain all necessary permitting required to implement the selected technology. 
The contractor must have a thorough understanding of invasive mussel control biology and growth on the Colorado River and be able to tailor the treatment program to the needs of the LCD.
The contractor will be required to monitor mussel growth in and around the LCD and must be able to develop and optimize invasive mussel control programs unique to each Dam based on mussel growth and control requirements.
The contractor will be required to monitor and evaluate the efficacy of the treatments as needed for the technology. Capability statements are to be submitted not later than 4:00 p.m. (PDT) on February 23, 2012, to Rita Horkan, LC-10212, Contract Specialist, P.O. Box 61470, Boulder City, NV 89006-1470 or via e-mail to rhorkan@usbr.gov.

<DESC><p style="text-align: left;">The National Science Foundation (NSF), an independent agency of the United States Government, is performing market research to determine potential sources for international tax consulting services with particularized expertise regarding the tax laws, rules, regulations and policies of the Government of Greenland as they apply to U.S. corporations and individuals supporting or engaging in federally funded research in Greenland either through contracts or federal financial assistance awards.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1950 to promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare and to secure the national defense. The Division of Arctic Sciences in the Office of Polar Programs&nbsp; supports scientific research in the Arctic and operational support related to that research. Science programs include disciplinary, multidisciplinary, and broad, interdisciplinary investigations directed toward both the Arctic as a region of special scientific interest and a region important to global systems. Disciplinary interests encompass the atmospheric, biological, physical, earth, ocean, and social sciences. To support the Arctic science mission, the Arctic Research Support and Logistics (RSL) Program supports the field component of research projects funded through science programs in the Division of Arctic Sciences of OPP and through other programs at NSF. RSL relies primarily on U.S. contractor and subcontractor workforces to supply the logistics support necessary to perform this research. Generally, NSF supported researchers are U.S. citizens employed by U.S. colleges and universities who receive federal financial assistance in the form of grants or cooperative agreements.</p>
<p>Responses to this&nbsp;Sources Sought notice&nbsp;will be treated as information only and will be considered as part of the Government's market research efforts.</p>
<p>Any interested firm should submit a written capability statement to include its experience in international tax matters, with particularized expertise in the Government of Greenland's evolving income tax laws, as well as other Government of Greenland tax laws, rules, regulations or policies that may be implicated by the aforementioned U.S. activities in Greenland.</p>
<p>Please do not submit any proprietary information in your capability statement.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall not exceed 5 pages readable in Microsoft Word 2007 and must be submitted via e-mail to Mary Rouse, Contracting Officer, mrouse@nsf.gov no later than February 24, 2012. Only e-mail electronic submissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME. This request for capability information does not constitute a request for proposals; submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary; the Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred.</p>

<a href="mailto:lisa.a.jackson@nasa.gov">Lisa A Jackson</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA/DFRC is hereby soliciting information about potential sources forparticipation in a case study to draft a type certification basis for the airworthinessof an unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Dryden Flight Research Center(DFRC) is seeking information from all interested parties, including Small, SmallDisadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service DisabledVeteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses,and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) forthe purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and/or small businesssubcontracting goals for the Airworthiness Certification Case Study for Unmanned AircraftSystems. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB),Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responseshereto. The case study is being conducted as part of NASA's Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integrationin the National Airspace System Project. The goal is to advance formation of the UAScertification process by developing a type certification basis for a UAS (including theaircraft, communication links, ground control elements, and other supporting equipment).The case study would involve working with a team from NASA to identify all existingFederal Aviation Regulations (FARs) that apply to the UAS, proposed exemptions from theregulations, and proposed special conditions. The case study would also evaluate theresults to determine applicability to other UAS. The case study requires detailed design information about a manufacturer's UAS,sufficient to establish the type certification basis, as well as interaction with themanufacturer to understand the design and intended operational scenarios or use cases.The case study would follow the practices used for establishing a type certificationbasis for a manned aircraft, but would benefit from leveraging existing work by the FAAon the theoretical applicability of the current body of regulations to UAS. The processinvolves development of issue papers as per Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order8110.112 as the means for accomplishing the steps in the type certification process. Theexpectation is that the process of determining a proposed type certification basis for aUAS would help identify: (1) existing regulations that clearly apply to the proposed UAS,(2) existing regulations that may need modification or UAS-specific interpretation toapply, (3) existing regulations that do not apply and should be exempted, and (4) wherespecial conditions may be needed to identify safety issues not addressed in the FARs orother guidance, or for novel or unusual design features specific to that UAS. Documentingthe rationale for all of these findings is an important part of the case study. This case study would provide an empirical evaluation of airworthiness requirements forUAS to help validate the theoretical work, would lay the groundwork for typecertification of the UAS under study, and could expedite establishment of a UAScertification process that could be implemented by the FAA. Because any single case studywould only address those regulations relevant to the particular UAS under study, theresults would not represent a comprehensive assessment of all regulations or thosenecessary for other UAS. However, the potential exists to provide an initial step in thetype certification process for one or more UAS to operate in the National Airspace System(NAS) for civil use. The case study is targeting UAS platforms that weigh more than 55 lbs; that are fixedwing, rotary wing, or hybrid aircraft; and that are intended to operate within the U.S.National Airspace System for commercial/civil application. NASA prefers vehicles thatrepresent a broad segment of UAS types rather than a narrow segment or a unique vehicle.Special purpose operations typical of a restricted category aircraft (e.g., aerialsurveying, pipeline patrolling, agricultural spraying or monitoring, and forest andwildlife conservation) are targeted in addition to those operations typical of normalcategory aircraft. UAS used exclusively for experimental or recreational purposes, orwhose operation is within the purview of FAA regulation expected for "small" UAS, arebeyond the scope of this effort. The intended partnership between NASA and one or more industry partners will jointly:define the intended mission or use case for a UAS, evaluate the UAS design to identifypotential certification issues, develop a certification basis worksheet that willidentify all applicable requirements, exemptions, and special conditions that areanticipated, develop a compliance checklist, document rationale for all findings, andevaluate the results for applicability to other UAS. At a minimum, the draft typecertification basis and any reports on the process and extension of the results areintended for open and public distribution. Qualified providers are considered to be U.S. commercial entities that are establishedand recognized developers of UAS, who have previous history in the successful developmentand production of a UAS. Experience with FAA certification processes is desirable, butnot required. Interested companies are invited to submit specific information on the following topics: 1. Category of offeror: Indicate your status as a UAS manufacturer. Provide data onprevious development of UAS. Indicate whether any of your UAS have flown under an FAACertificate of Authorization (COA) or experimental certificate. Indicate any experiencewith the FAA's type certification process. 2. UAS type: Describe UAS for consideration for the case study. Description shouldinclude the following, as a minimum: aircraft weight, aircraft dimensions, operationalaltitude, speed and endurance, means of propulsion, ground control station, communicationlinks, and launch/recovery methods (if non-conventional). List any novel features of theproposed UAS other than the systems and equipment needed to support unmanned operations(such as unusual aerodynamic configurations, novel structural designs, or novelpropulsion systems). Identify whether there are subsystems of the UAS that you wouldconsider out of scope for any type certification study. 3. UAS use case: Describe the mission(s) or proposed commercial application(s) for theUAS to be considered for the case study and the expected operational environment,including operation restrictions. Describe the class of airspace used for the applicationand the means to meet airspace operational requirements such as compliance with see andavoid (14 CFR 91.113) requirements and timely compliance with air traffic controlinstructions. 4. Public distribution of results: Indicate your willingness to agree to open and publicdistribution of the draft type certification basis and any reports on the process andextension of the results. Prospective offerors are invited to submit written technical comments or questions to:Kelly Hayhurst, no later than March 25, 2012. When responding reference "AirworthinessCertification Case Study for Unmanned Aircraft Systems". Comments may be submitted to Ms.Hayhurst via electronic transmission: kelly.j.hayhurst@nasa.gov or by facsimiletransmission: 757-864-4234. Interested offerors/vendors having the required specialized capabilities to meet theabove requirement should submit as a minimum, a brief description of your relevantcompany capabilities, products and services, history, and other specific information, asrequested in this solicitation, to indicate the ability to perform all aspects of theeffort described herein. Specific information related to any or all of the topicsidentified above is desired. As part of your information package, please include companyTechnical Point(s) of Contact including address, telephone number, and e-mail address.The information package should be provided as a PDF document and the upload should notexceed 10 pages. Please advise if the requirement is considered to be a commercial or commercial-typeproduct. A commercial item is defined in FAR 2.101. At its discretion, NASA may request further discussions and/or clarifications of theinformation submitted in the early 2012 time frame. If agreeable to both parties, suchdiscussions may take place via teleconferencing or an on-site visit at NASA LangleyResearch Center facilities in Hampton, Virginia, at the offerors expense. If they dooccur, discussions will be limited to a two hour time duration, and will consist ofvendor presentations and subsequent discussions of the presented material only.Representatives from NASA and their Contractors may be present for such discussions.

<DESC>The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) is a project underway in Cadarache, France to construct a device that will demonstrate nuclear fusion power at a powerplant-relevant scale (http://www.iter.org/ ). The work scope associated with the Steady State Electrical Network (SSEN) materials and supplies is assigned to the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), a national laboratory operated for the United States Department of Energy (DOE) by Princeton University under Contract No. DE-AC02-09CH11466. PPPL is responsible for the work described in a Statement of Work (SOW), posted on PPPL website http://procurement.pppl.gov/Procurement%20Opportunities.HTM.<br />This SOW covers engineering support services related to the specification, procurement, and manufacturing of the AC power distribution equipment comprising the US Domestic Agency contribution, to be provided by the Engineering Support Subcontractor (ESS).<br />The ESS shall produce purchasing specifications suitable for the procurement of various electrical equipment for the SSEN 400kV substation and medium voltage distribution at 22kV and 6.6kV including circuit breakers, disconnect/earthing switches, substation transformers, switchgear, power transformers, and related items. The format/template of the specifications shall be determined by the ESS consistent with standard practice as applicable to each type of equipment along with PPPL requirements for specifications.<br />The ESS shall develop, in consultation with PPPL, a list of manufacturers from which offers will be sought, considering the global manufacturing community. The PPPL Procurement Division will issue solicitations, lead the evaluation of offers, negotiate with selected suppliers, and place and administer all contracts for the purchase of the subject equipment. Therefore procurement services and responsibility are not included in the scope of this SOW. The ITER Project will utilize a Global Transport and Logistics Service (GTLS) and will take responsibility for shipment. Therefore support<br />for shipping and related items such as insurance, tariffs, etc., is not included in the scope of this SOW.<br />The ESS shall develop and maintain an overall schedule for the design and production of the equipment including major milestones. The ESS shall maintain an effective Quality Assurance Program with implementing procedures to assure compliance with this SOW. The ESS shall interface directly with each manufacturer to coordinate activities and to provide on-site Quality Control (QC) services. PPPL shall be kept informed of activities and shall have final approval authority with benefit of recommendations of the ESS.<br />It is the intent of PPPL to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to perform the work objectives described in the SOW during the month of February 2012. The subcontract period of performance will be approximately two and a half years (July 2012 through December 2014). This announcement is not a solicitation and does not obligate PPPL to issue a solicitation. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their capabilities to perform this work. Please note that corporations who are involved in the manufacturing of electrical equipment are welcome to submit a proposal. However, to avoid potential conflicts of interest, their manufactured equipment would be excluded from the SSEN procurements. Information submitted should describe your organization, personnel, facilities, applicable subcontractor network and past experience to meet specific needs stated above. Include company name, address, phone number, technical point of contact, and brochure/literature. Please send your documentation to Natalya Gnyp at the office identified above, by fax to (609) 243-2021 or by email to ngnyp@pppl.gov. Electronic submittals are preferred. Please be advised that PPPL will not pay for any information submitted in response to this announcement.

Concerns having the ability to furnish the services and supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the name and telephone number for a point of contact) to the contract specialist listed in the announcement within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.
The U.S. Geological Survey, Columbia Environmental Research Center, River Studies Branch has a requirement for collection, analysis, and reporting of migration,  spawning, and larval drift of endangered pallid sturgeon on the Milk and upper Missouri River, Spring and Summer 2012. 
Climatic conditions in 2012 present a unique opportunity for USGS to vastly improve understanding of the relation between flow pulses and spawning of the endangered pallid sturgeon.  The hydrologic regime in the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam during 2012 is projected to be unique among the last several years due to record prairie snowfall and persistent elevated discharge conditions during summer from tributaries.  Persistent elevated discharge of warm turbid water from the Milk River during 2012 may enhance suitability of the Missouri River for pallid sturgeon spawning and/or promote spawning within the Milk River.  Wild adult pallid sturgeon implanted with transmitters have been observed in the Milk River during elevated flow conditions in 2004 (Braaten and Fuller 2005), and wild adults and hatchery-raised juvenile pallid sturgeon used the Milk River during elevated flows in 2010 (Braaten and Fuller, in prep; Haddix et al., in prep).  Given the unique hydrologic conditions of 2012 and the potential for enhancement of improved conditions for pallid sturgeon spawning, this study will focus on evaluating use, migrations, and spawning of pallid sturgeon in the Milk River and Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam.
USGS, Columbia Environmental Research Center needs to deploy trained fisheries biologists with specific and detailed understanding of the upper Missouri River, Milk River, and pallid sturgeon biology to collection telemetry locations, egg and larval drift data, and information on where larvae settle out of the drift.  The work needs to begin in spring 2012 to catch the unique hydrologic event.  The work must be accomplished following prescribed data collection and fish handling protocols:
	Pallid sturgeon handling - http://www.fws.gov/mountain-prairie/endspp/protocols/protocols.html	Larval sturgeon capture -  http://www.moriverrecovery.org/mrrp/MRRP_PUB_DEV.download_documentation?p_file=7273	Adult Sturgeon telemetry -  http://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2009/5201/
The 2012 hydrologic condition is a unique opportunity to collect critical data bearing on how reproduction of an extremely endangered fish can be managed by flow regime. The contractor shall research population of wild adult pallid sturgeon implanted with radio transmitters in earlier studies, currently inhabiting the Missouri River and lower Yellowstone River.  This research population is comprised of known-sex individuals; however, individuals in this population need to be reproductively assessed to evaluate readiness to spawn.  Additional individuals may be added to the research population pending additional implantation during Upper Basin broodstock collections in April-May 2012.  Migrations and use of the Milk River and Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam by the research population shall be assessed from April through July using a combination of manual radio tracking and automated logging.  Reproductive stage will be assessed (via blood samples, gonad samples) as individuals enter, reside, and exit the two river systems.  A change in reproductive state (e.g., female loss of weight, body cavity void of eggs, blood-hormones indicative of post-reproductive levels) will provide documentation of pallid sturgeon spawning in the Milk River or Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam.
Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (State of Montana) has current regulatory authority to permit tracking and handling of endangered species on these rivers, and is therefore is fully permitted to carry out this work.  

Based on the information at this time, the government considers the services specified as a sole source from Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks (State of Montana) and proposes to negotiate a contract with them on that basis.  However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.  Firms who feel that they can furnish the required services and supplies or its functional equivalent (based on the criteria specified herein) are invited to submit, in writing, an affirmative response to this announcement.  An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and other such materials which correspond to the required services and supplies stated herein.  This information will be evaluated and used to determine if competitive opportunities exist.  , Affirmative response shall be received by this office by close of business Feb 22, 2011 by 3:00 P.M. Mountain Standard Time.  This notice may represent the Governments only official notice of this procurement.

The software database must have the capability to monitor, audit, provide surveillance, provide quality/management controls and other functions for a wide range of healthcare/administration activities.  The technology must have the ability to assist in the design and creation of forms for ease of data collection.  These forms must then be easily scanned into a database and auto-populate the correct data fields of a database.  The database may be in Microsoft Excel/Access format.  Then it must be capable of being manipulated and analyzed so that ECHCS can create trend reports or other useful information.  Once the database is setup, it must have the flexibility to allow additional data fields to be created so that the end-user can get further drill-down data in the next iteration of data collection/analysis.  Database must have the capability to be merged for further analysis.  System must contain active privacy/security feature in the technology.  Company's product must have the ability to import from another VA facilities shell database, templates, forms, reports, etc., and the ability to then easily customize and adapt them to ECHCS use, if that VA utilizes the company's product.  While ECHCS does not expect this technology to interact with VISTA/CPRS, they may dump data onto excel format document, which could be uploaded into this technology. For purposes of conducting the demonstrations the vendor shall sign-in as per VHA/ECHCS regulations.  Demonstrations shall be no longer than 1.5 hours, including question and answer period.  The ECHCS audience will include ELT members, contracting, IT, Biomed, Privacy Officer, Information Security Office, QMED, a variety of end users, which may include but not be limited to clinical/administrative service chiefs, chief nurses, etc.  Vendor shall provide all necessary equipment to aid in the demonstration, which may include handouts, brochures, powerpoint presentations, etc.  Vendor should briefly introduce the company and participating members, provide an overview, but spend the majority of time discussing menus and product features and demonstrate how the system will benefit and be customized for ECHCS local use.  Vendor should also discuss what their training and long-term support would entail and provide input on what your experience is with other VA hospitals and provide names and contacts for other VA's that may be utilizing the vendors product.  All demonstrations shall be conducted at the expense of the vendors (no charge to the Government), and vendor shall breakdown and remove all equipment upon completion of the demonstration.  This is a request for product information and sources only, which may or may not lead to product demonstrations!  This is not a request for proposal (RFP).   The VA shall not pay for information received and demonstrations conducted that may result from this sources sought.  Requests for copies of a solicitation shall not be honored or acknowledged.  Information should be forwarded to the Contracting Officer by February 15, 2012 at 4:00 p.m. MST.

<DESC>Advance Notice for the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology Forum<br><br>1.  This is a special notice to industry inviting attendance to the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Technology Forum (UAS-TF).  The Government seeks involvement of industry in capturing potential improvement technology for unmanned aircraft systems, either ground sub-systems or air vehicles, including payloads.

The US Army Unmanned Aircraft System Project Office (UAS PO) is inviting AUVSI Pathfinder Symposium industry attendees and other interested industry participants to schedule one-on-one UAS-TF appointments to make brief presentations about technologies related to future payloads, sense and avoid, ground systems and air vehicles.  The industry technology presented is required to be at least a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 and a Manufacturing Readiness Level (MRL) 5.  Verbal commitment must be in place that the TRL / MRL 5 exist before scheduling can take place.<br><br>3.  The intent of the government is to identify technology improvements or new technologies that are at TRL / MRL 5.  This technology improvement may be implemented, in whole or in part, in UAS individual projects according to specific requirements and objectives, but the UAS-TF is not involved with any specific implementation of these technologies.<br><br>4.  This special notice seeks to identify interested parties who wish to present new or improved technologies to the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Project Office.  All material presented or discussed must be unclassified.  The UAS-TF and its consultative body include, or may include, Government individuals from the Architecture and Technology Branch of the UAS PO, and subject matter experts from the UAS PO that pertain to the subject matter presented.  No SETA or Contractors will be present; therefore, no NDAs should be necessary.  The Government shall have in place sufficient physical accommodations so that proprietary material may be shown to the Government at the option of the TF presenters.  The UAS PO Security Officers and Legal professionals will be present.  Details related to ongoing or possible future acquisition activities or plans within DoD or any of the Services will not be discussed.<br><br>5.  To further facilitate communications and input from interested parties, UAS-TF will be held 14 March 2012, 0800-1600 and 15 March 2012, 0800-1600 at the AUVSI Pathfinder Symposium at the Von Braun Center in Huntsville, AL.

The Government will provide a projector and power outlets.  Presenting company must provide a laptop if deemed appropriate for the presentation.  Government requests five hardcopies of the presentation, which will be closely held and protected at the conclusion of the brief.  The Government will honor appropriate proprietary markings of the presenting company.  Presentations must contain presenters' names and contact info to include email addresses and phone numbers.  Interested parties wishing to participate in UAS-TF should register on or before 8 March 2012 by emailing Jennifer.Perritt@us.army.mil.

<DESC>RFI 12-0001<br />Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Warstopper Program<br />Request for Information (RFI)
<p>1. Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Contracting Services Office Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 26-1N-8115, Philadelphia, PA, 19111.</p>
<p>2. General Information<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements. If the Government develops a program that addresses any submitted or similar topic, the resulting procurement will address technology and business specific requirements as defined by the Government to achieve the required objectives.</p>
<p>PLEASE IDENTIFY THE INFORMATION, IN ANY OF YOUR ANSWERS, THAT YOU CONSIDERED TO BE PROPRIETARY.</p>
<p>4. Required Reponses<br />Responses to this RFI are limited to 5 single-sided, double-spaced pages, using standard letter-size 8&frac12;" x 11" paper. The font for text should be Times New Roman 12-point or larger. Responses must be unclassified. No binders or binding should be used. Reference RFI 12-0001. <br />5. Request for Clarification<br />A responder may request clarification, in writing, from the Contracting Officer for any requirement that is unclear, by sending an e-mail to melissa.spishak@dla.mil.</p>
<p>Any requests for clarification must be received no later than seven (7) business days prior to the close of this RFI in order to receive a timely response.</p>
<p>6. Submission of Documentation<br />Responses to this RFI are due to the contracting office identified below by 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time, 24 February 2012. Responders shall provide one (1) electronic copy and one (1) paper copy of their response. All electronic file content must match the print versions of the submitted documents. Should the electronic and print versions of submitted documents not match exactly, the electronic version shall take precedence. Electronic submissions, in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat formats, shall be accompanied by a printed inventory that identifies all CDs, their file contents, and their electronic formats. All CDs and files are to be labeled with the responder's name, contact information, and submission date. All RFI responses must be unclassified. Existing commercial documentation and product literature can also be submitted and is not subject to the page limitation.</p>
<p>Documentation shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer at the following address:<br />Defense Contracting Services Office <br />Attn: Melissa Spishak<br />700 Robbins Ave, Bldg 26-1N-8115<br />Philadelphia, PA 19111<br />Email: Melissa.Spishak@dla.mil</p>
<p>7. Additional Information<br />All responsible sources may submit information that shall be considered by the agency. If late information is received, it may be considered, depending on agency time constraints. All routine communications regarding this announcement should be directed to the contractual point of contact listed above. The Government may or may not use any responses to this RFI as a basis for a subsequent project. Any projects developed from the RFI responses may be the subject of a subsequent acquisition; any such subsequent acquisition will be posted in FBO.gov. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. No requests for a bid package or solicitation will be accepted; no bid package or solicitation exists at this time.

<DESC>RFI 12-0003<br />Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Warstopper Program<br />Request for Information (RFI)
<p>1. Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Contracting Services Office Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 26-1N-8115, Philadelphia, PA, 19111.</p>
<p>2. General Information<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements.

<DESC>RFI 12-0007<br />Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Warstopper Program<br />Request for Information (RFI)
<p>1. Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Contracting Services Office Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 26-1N-8115, Philadelphia, PA, 19111.</p>
<p>2. General Information<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>

<DESC>RFI 12-0012<br />Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Warstopper Program<br />Request for Information (RFI)
<p>1. Contracting Office Address<br />Defense Contracting Services Office Philadelphia, 700 Robbins Avenue, Bldg 26-1N-8115, Philadelphia, PA, 19111.</p>
<p>2. General Information<br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e), to obtain information for planning purposes. This RFI is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Further, DSCO-P is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>

<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements.

<p>4. Required Reponses<br />Responses to this RFI are limited to 5 single-sided, double-spaced pages, using standard letter-size 8&frac12;" x 11" paper.

<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements.

Respondees are advised that DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all cost associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. No telephone calls will be accepted requesting a bid package or solicitation. There is no bid package or solicitation at this time. All information received shall be safeguarded from unauthorized disclosure. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>3. General Intent<br />The purpose of the Warstopper Program is to ensure maintenance of "Those resources required for all plans, actions, or measures necessary to establish and maintain an industrial base, both government-owned and privately-owned, that is required to support current, wartime, or other contingency military requirements." The scope of the Warstopper Program includes all sectors of the industrial base necessary to support the Department of Defense (DoD) with manufacturing capabilities sufficient to meet increased requirements during wartime and contingency operations. <br />The Warstopper Program seeks to establish partnerships with raw material suppliers that support prime or sub-tier suppliers of DLA or DoD contracts to ensure that the industrial base is prepared to respond to the Military Services' increased demand for items designated as critical during times of mobilization, war, contingency and military or other operations. Rather than purchasing raw material, the Government is interested in contracting for the services of contractors to build and manage buffer inventories to be made available for the Government's needs. The intent would be to rotate the inventory through the fulfillment of orders to authorized value chain partners as identified by the government. The Warstopper Program seeks this initial information for the purpose of structuring future competitive solicitations related to raw material buffers to support go-to-war items.<br />Questions of consideration:<br />1. Are you a raw material or semi-finished material provider to Government end-item contracts? If yes, please identify the raw material you produce and the corresponding end items they are used in. If you do not know if your material is used on DLA or DoD contracts, please identify the raw or semi-finished materials that have experience increasing lead times and higher than average prices, over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>2. Do you presently keep raw or semi-finished material inventories in support of Government contracts? If yes, what materials are these and do you see a basis to expand the inventory buffer for readiness purposes (i.e. to meet increased Warfighter demand)? If you believe there are limitations that would inhibit your ability to expand these buffers, please identify and explain those limitations.</p>
<p><br />3. If you are a supplier to DoD prime or sub-tier suppliers and currently do not maintain any raw or semi-finished inventories, would you consider developing and maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffer inventory of raw material? If yes, what materials would you consider doing this for? If no, please indicate why.</p>
<p>4. Would a program management and/or an inventory management fee be required for you to consider expanding, developing, or maintaining a contractor owned and managed buffers? If yes, please provide an estimate with an explanation of how it was derived?</p>
<p><br />5. Would you have the ability to track the established buffer inventory and provide monthly reports to the government?</p>
<p>6. Is there any additional information that you think is relevant for the Government to know about your ability and willingness to establish and maintain raw material buffers?<br />DISCLAMER: There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government program. Responders to this RFI will have no competitive advantage in receiving any awards related to the submitted topic area. The information submitted in response to this RFI may be used to help the Government further define its requirements. If the Government develops a program that addresses any submitted or similar topic, the resulting procurement will address technology and business specific requirements as defined by the Government to achieve the required objectives.</p>
<p>PLEASE IDENTIFY THE INFORMATION, IN ANY OF YOUR ANSWERS, THAT YOU CONSIDERED TO BE PROPRIETARY.</p>
<p>4. Required Reponses<br />Responses to this RFI are limited to 5 single-sided, double-spaced pages, using standard letter-size 8&frac12;" x 11" paper. The font for text should be Times New Roman 12-point or larger. Responses must be unclassified. No binders or binding should be used. Reference RFI 12-0001. <br />5. Request for Clarification<br />A responder may request clarification, in writing, from the Contracting Officer for any requirement that is unclear, by sending an e-mail to melissa.spishak@dla.mil.</p>
<p>Any requests for clarification must be received no later than seven (7) business days prior to the close of this RFI in order to receive a timely response.</p>

This notice is informational only and is neither a request for quote nor a solicitation of proposals. Responses received may be evaluated; however, a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must be detailed information and must show clear and convincing evidence within 3 days that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities and any other information that demonstrates an ability to meet the agency's needs.  Information can be sent to carlos.suggs@va.gov.

Ethicon, Incorporated, DBA Advanced Sterilization Products, is currently providing full service maintenance, to include semi-annual preventive maintenance, all parts, labor and travel for two (2) ASP STERRAD NX Hydrogen Peroxide Plasma Sterilizers for the Veteran Administration Tennessee Valley Healthcare System located in Nashville, Tennessee.  Ethicon, Incorporated is the only contractor with the capability to repair this equipment due to the proprietary nature of the parts in the unit(s) that only the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) has.  These are very specialized systems that utilize Hydrogen Peroxide to create plasma by using a catalytic converter.  This sterilizer is used for the sterilization of surgical instruments and supplies that cannot be sterilized using steam or ethylene oxide.  These devices are regulated by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and cannot be modified with use of non-original manufacturer parts.  Substantial duplication of cost to the Government is not expected to be recovered through competition and Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements would occur. 

Under the authority FAR Part 6.302-1(a) allows for the procurement of items through other than full and open competition; applicable when the agency's minimum needs may only be satisfied by a service that is unique and available from only one responsible source.  Ethicon, Incorporated, DBA Advanced Sterilization Products, is the only known local source to satisfy this current need.

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTES.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Health Administration, SAO-EAST, NCO 4, Philadelphia VAMC, Vet Center # 210 intends to award a sole-source, firm fixed contract in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.302-1. This requirement is for the provision of Readjustment Counseling Services. The Government intends to make a sole source award to Family & Psychological Services, Inc, 1868 Greentree Road, Cherry Hill, NJ 08003, under NAICS Code 621420. The solicitation will not be posted.  For any questions please contact Contract Specialist, Matt Parlett at 610.384.7711 EXT 3233 or via e-mail at Matthew.Parlett@va.gov.


OVERVIEW.

The contractor shall furnish readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans referred by Vet Center staff members or professional staff members of VA Psychiatry, Social Work, Psychology or Nursing Services.  Readjustment counseling, for purposes of the considered contract, is counseling provided by social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, or other qualified counselors, individually or in groups, specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral difficulties specifically related to the post-war readjustment to civilian life.  Such difficulties may interfere with a veteran's job performance, educational pursuits, family and other interpersonal relations, or overall ability to cope with daily life.  Modalities of readjustment counseling include individual, group, and family counseling; all of which have as their central purpose the post-war readjustment of Vietnam era and/or post-Vietnam war zone veterans.

The contemplated contract represents the drawing down and the discontinuing of contracting for readjustment counseling services by the Vet Center # 210.  No further solicitation or requirements for readjustment counseling are planned or anticipated.

Contracting by sole source allows for the avoidance of; transferring client records from the incumbent contractor to a new contractor and then to a VA provider, and to provide for the smoothest transition possible for clients so that their counseling experience is not unduly interrupted/compromised by having to switch counselors multiple times during the duration of a few months.

<SOLNBR>
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for GfK Kenetec Inc's AgroTrak pesticide usage data.
The USGS is aware of no other source that can provide the above.  Therefore, it intends to make an award to GfK Kenetec Inc., unless it is contacted by any vendor who believes they obtained similar technical expertise and can provide the same service.  Vendors are invited to contact the Contract Specialist, Bryan O'Shaughnessy (bposhaughnessy@usgs.gov) no later than 12:00 PM EST, Thursday, February 16, 2012 with an affirmative answer.  
The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) considers employee signatures to be Personal Protected Information, and therefore all employee signatures have been redacted. By posting this document, the Contract Specialist attests all appropriate signatures have been obtained.
SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION STATES THE FOLLOWING PART:
The following information is provided to demonstrate the proposed contractor's unique qualifications:The USGS National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) Program produces a national assessment of pesticides in water resources through modeling.  Accomplishing this assessment and related modeling requires annual estimates of pesticide use for watersheds that are sampled, as well as all other watersheds in the nation.  The use data provided by Dmrkynetec Inc. is the only source of such data on a nation-wide basis for each year.  The USGS models and assessment results are provided to the public and other users through publications and web site access.  The models are used by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other state and local governments to evaluate the distribution of pesticides in water resources and potential concerns for aquatic life and drinking water.
GfK Kynetec, Inc. is the only provider of the required data for USGS NAWQA Program by providing use coefficients for 320 active ingredients used on 60 crops grown across the conterminous US, as well as seed trait information.  Information is collected annually based on a statistical sample of 432 sub-state CRDs, which represent multi-county areas within a state that share similar crop management practices and growing conditions.  GfK Kynetec, Inc.=BFs AgroTrak also provides estimates of the statistical reliability of use estimates for each active ingredient and crop.  
GfK Kynetec, Inc is uniquely qualified because they are the only entity, public or private, that supplies the subject data on an annual basis at the CRD spatial resolution.  The data are developed from a proprietary statistical survey employing one-on-one detailed surveys of thousands of growers.  No other firm provides this service, nor does any Federal agency.
The program office and contracting conducted market research and was unable to identify a product or vendor, other than GfK Kenetec's ArgoTrak that could provide pesticide usage data that meets the agencies requirement.

<DESC>The OO-ALC/PKESA, Hill AFB Utah, intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a Fixed Firm Price contract for Brand Name Dupont IMRON 6000 paint to the responsible quoter whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, which will be most advantageous to the government. The Government reserves the right to not make an award at all.
<p>Brand Name Purchase Circumstances/Mission Impact:<br /><br />The 309th AMXG Corrosion Control Flight is under contract to strip and paint "Fat Albert" the US Navy Aerial Demonstration Team Blue Angels C-130 support aircraft. Naval Aviation (NAVAIR) engineering and NAVAIR drawing 14E2359 dated 2010-06-04, requires IMRON 6000 manufactured by DuPont be utilized on all the Blue Angels F-18 and C-130 aircraft. This coating is being used by all the aircraft in the Blue Angels flight and must be utilized to maintain uniformity and consistency. This coating is designed where superior performance and superior appearance is required. This high performance, high gloss, extremely durable and chemical resistant system is one of the only coatings available in the required metallic and pearl colors. NAVAIR has evaluated numerous similar coating systems with DuPont IMRON 6000 the only one that met their performance and appearance requirements.</p>
<p>Failure to acquire this coating in a timely manner will result in the 309th AMXG's failure to meet required schedules to support the ongoing wartime effort, missed pre-negotiated delivery dates and the possibility of losing the workload as well as preventing the OO-ALC center from performing its mission.</p>
<p>All payments are to be paid via the Internet through the Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF) system. WAWF may be accessed at https://wawf.eb.mil. WAWF training may be accessed online at http://www.wawftraining.com. Payment information may be accessed using DFAS website at https://www.dfas.mil. Your purchase order/contract number or invoice will be required to inquire the status of your payment.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation PR42177 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55 dated January 3, 2012. This acquisition is not a small business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, which has a size standard of 500.<br />CDC intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirement: <br />&bull; One (1) UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system<br />&bull; Shipping, installation, performance verification and basic on-site training of the system</p>
<p>The system will be used for the development and implementation of analysis methods to maintain continuity of measurement of nutritional biomarkers. To ensure that our laboratory is fully meeting its public health mandate it is critical that we possess the best possible measurement tools for developing biomonitoring assays. This will enable our laboratory to provide better identification of bioactive dietary compound exposure sources, higher statistical power in studies, and ensure the generation of robust, scientifically valid epidemiological data. The procurement of the state-of-the-art UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system is essential to accomplishing these goals.<br />The procurement of UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system will serve both immediate identified needs for biomonitoring analyses and be a key part of our laboratory infrastructure for developing future methods. It is impossible to predict the exact needs of future biomonitoring projects; therefore, it is imperative that we obtain UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system with the best possible combination of performance attributes and functionality to serve any possible biomonitoring endeavor. To accomplish this, we have identified both a list of minimum technical requirements for the candidate UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system as well as developed a list of criteria that will be used to evaluate potential (see attached). Each criterion has been ranked in terms of its relative importance to the whole UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system. <br />The proposals are due on January 24, 2012 at 8:00 a.m., EST. All proposals are to be submitted electronically to Pellumbeshe Hoxhaj @ kfx2@cdc.gov. Please provide any questions in writing electronically to the aforementioned e-mail address by January 17, 2011 at 8:00 a.m. EST. No telephone calls concerning questions regarding the RFP will be accepted. <br />The proposals may be in any format but MUST include: company's name, address, phone and tax identification number (TIN) and DUNS #; point of contact's name, phone, and email; proposal number &amp; date; item price, shipping, installation, performance verification and basic on-site training of the system; total price; applicable discounts; timeframe that the proposal is valid; delivery schedule-FOB destination; warranty information (if applicable); completed FAR 52.212-3, Representations and Certifications. <br />PROVISIONS/CLAUSES</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation PR42181 is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-55 dated January 3, 2012. This acquisition is not a small business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 334516, which has a size standard of 500.<br />CDC intends to award a firm-fixed-price contract for the following requirement: <br />&bull; One (1) UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system<br />&bull; Shipping, installation, performance verification and basic on-site training of the system</p>
<p>The system will be used for the development and implementation of analysis methods for measuring aflatoxin levels in tobacco products. Upon completion of this assignment, this system will also be used for the development and implementation of analysis methods to maintain continuity of measurement of nutritional biomarkers. To ensure that our laboratory is fully meeting its public health mandate it is critical that we possess the best possible measurement tools for developing biomonitoring assays. This will enable our laboratory to provide better identification of bioactive dietary compound exposure sources, higher statistical power in studies, and ensure the generation of robust, scientifically valid epidemiological data. The procurement of the state-of-the-art UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system is essential to accomplishing these goals.<br />The procurement of UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system will serve both immediate identified needs for biomonitoring analyses and be a key part of our laboratory infrastructure for developing future methods. It is impossible to predict the exact needs of future biomonitoring projects; therefore, it is imperative that we obtain UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system with the best possible combination of performance attributes and functionality to serve any possible biomonitoring endeavor. To accomplish this, we have identified both a list of minimum technical requirements for the candidate UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system as well as developed a list of criteria that will be used to evaluate potential (see attached). Each criterion has been ranked in terms of its relative importance to the whole UHPLC-triple quadrupole MS/MS system. <br />The proposals are due on January 24, 2012 at 8:00 a.m., EST. All proposals are to be submitted electronically to Pellumbeshe Hoxhaj @ kfx2@cdc.gov. Please provide any questions in writing electronically to the aforementioned e-mail address by January 17, 2011 at 8:00 a.m. EST. No telephone calls concerning questions regarding the RFP will be accepted. <br />The proposals may be in any format but MUST include: company's name, address, phone and tax identification number (TIN) and DUNS #; point of contact's name, phone, and email; proposal number &amp; date; item price, shipping, installation, performance verification and basic on-site training of the system; total price; applicable discounts; timeframe that the proposal is valid; delivery schedule-FOB destination; warranty information (if applicable); completed FAR 52.212-3, Representations and Certifications. <br />PROVISIONS/CLAUSES</p>

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

The various dates and numbers of hotel rooms, meeting room requirements, and meals required are specified on the attached Request for Quote. <br><br>2.  Third party offerors shall include the additional information requested in the following lettered paragraphs (a through c).  Failure to provide this information with any quote may deem the quote to be technically unacceptable and/or non-responsive.  For a proposal submitted by an offeror that is not a caterer, the offeror must provide the following:<br>a. A separate document describing the technical approach for the offerors services as a prime contractor.  The technical approach must state that a representative from the third party will be available full-time during the inclusive dates of the requirement.  The technical approach must include the third party representative's name and contact information; and<br>b. A copy of a signed written agreement between the third party offeror and hotel/food service vendor (who has the authority of the hotel/food service vendor) which states that the third party has been given the authority to propose a quote for the stated hotel/food service vendor.

This may result in award to other than the lowest offer received.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: price, availability of rooms, and proposed menu. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. Additional requirements apply to third-party offerors; these requirements are contained elsewhere in this solicitation.

The Contracting Officer is not responsible for locating or obtaining any information not identified in the quote.  Offerors are advised that the hotel rooms will not be paid for as part of any contract awarded-- the hotel rooms are part of the total requirement for the event but will be paid for by the individual soldiers or their respective units; the cost of the hotel rooms will be part of the evaluation criteria for the overall cost of the event.

The anticipated award will be a Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) type contract.  Offerors must submit quotes on the full quantity identified.  Award shall be made to a single offeror.  The Government reserves the right to make no award under this procedure.  Offerors shall utilize the attached RFQ document to submit their offer.  All late quotes will be rejected.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented through FAC 2005-55, effective 2 February 2012 and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is issued unrestricted under the NAICS 721110 with a small business size standard of $30M.  <br><br>The Virginia Army National Guard will conduct a 60 day Yellow Ribbon Post Mobilization Event on April 14, 2012. The attached pricing schedule may be used for pricing or you may use your own pricing schedule.  However, your pricing schedule must clearly annotate pricing or the words "not separately priced" or "no cost" for each requirement identified.  Unit prices shall be inclusive of all applicable service fees.  In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided:  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rate(s) quoted by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable price(s).  However, pricing shall not exceed per diem pricing for the locality of the facility.<br><br>A performance work statement (PWS) is attached to this synopsis and is hereby made a part of this solicitation and will be made a part of any resulting award.  <br><br>The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition:  <br><br>FAR Provisions 52.212-1, 52.212-3 Alt I, and 52.252-1 and DFARS Provisions 252.209-7999 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR Provision 52.212-1 is amended as follows: Delete paragraphs (d) Product Samples.  <br><br>As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, "The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <br><br>Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the government's best interest to accept the proposed alternative. <br><br>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to quote all services, however, all lodging requirements must be quoted if providing lodging and all conference space and catering services shall be quoted if providing event services.  In determining the most advantageous pricing scenarios, the government will evaluate pricing as follows:  (1) Line items for lodging (attendee rooms, staff rooms and parking will be combined and line items for the event (required event space, to include audio visual and set-up requirements, catering requirements and parking) will be combined.  (2) If it is determined one vendor can meet all requirements (lodging and event) for the event and this vendor offers the overall lowest price, one award will be made to one vendor.  (3) If one vendor is not able to meet all requirements, one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for lodging and one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for the event. (4) An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards. <br><br>To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met for either group of services quoted:  <br><br>Group 1 (attendee lodging rooms, staff rooms, parking) (1) The quote must provide for all requirements within the group.  (2) The hotel facility proposed must provide guest informational service (i.e. front desk attendant, concierge service, etc.) 24 hours a day, (3) The hotel facility proposed must have on-site parking, or if off-site, valet services must be provided (4) The hotel facility proposed must be located in the Williamsburg, Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, or Portsmouth, VA area or, in Richmond, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64 and (5) The hotel facility proposed must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (4) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met.  The lodging facility FEMA number must be provided to determine if requirement (5) can be met.  If information to address minimum requirements 2-5 is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  <br><br>Group 2 (event space, catering and parking) (1) The quote must provide for all services within the group, (2) The event facility proposed must have on-site parking sufficient for all attendees, and (3) The event facility proposed must be located in the Williamsburg, Hampton, Norfolk, Virginia Beach, or Portsmouth, VA area or, in Richmond, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost.  For minimum requirement (2), an information sheet addressing the number of parking spaces available at the event facility must be provided.  For minimum requirement (3), the physical location of the proposed event facility must be provided.<br><br>In order for the event to be advantageous to the government, the lodging and event facilities per area must be located within five (5) miles of each other.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  <br><br>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented through FAC 2005-55, effective 2 February 2012 and additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This procurement is issued unrestricted under the NAICS 721110 with a small business size standard of $30M.  <br><br>The Virginia Army National Guard will conduct Yellow Ribbon Post Mobilization Events on April 27-29, 2012 and May 19, 2012. The attached pricing schedules may be used for pricing or you may use your own pricing schedule.  However, your pricing schedule must clearly annotate pricing or the words "not separately priced" or "no cost" for each requirement identified.  Unit prices shall be inclusive of all applicable service fees.  In anticipation of questions regarding if the government per diem rate is required, the following response is provided:  The solicitation is being issued on a competitive basis.  The rate utilized for purposes of award will be the rate(s) quoted by the offeror(s) determined to offer the lowest technically acceptable price(s).  However, pricing shall not exceed per diem pricing for the locality of the facility.<br><br>A separate performance work statement (PWS) for each event is attached to this synopsis and is hereby made a part of this solicitation and will be made a part of any resulting award.  <br><br>The following provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition:  <br><br>FAR and DFARS Provisions 52.212-1, 52.212-3 Alt I, 52.252-1, 252.209-7999 and 252.212-7001.  <br><br>FAR Provision 52.212-1 is amended as follows: Delete paragraphs (d) Product Samples.  <br><br>As stated in paragraph (g) of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Provision 52.212-1, included in this solicitation, "The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint." <br><br>Paragraph (e) of FAR Provision 52.212-1 encourages offerors to present alternative terms and conditions for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation.  Offeror must clearly annotate the alteration in the quote.  The government may or may not accept the alternative term or condition.  Such determination will be made based on if it is in the government's best interest to accept the proposed alternative. <br><br>Award will be made to the low price technically acceptable (LPTA) quote which represents the most advantageous scenario to the government considering the potential for multiple awards.  Since multiple awards will be considered, vendors are not required to quote all services, however, all lodging requirements must be quoted if providing lodging and all conference space and catering services shall be quoted if providing event services.  In determining the most advantageous pricing scenarios, the government will evaluate pricing as follows:  (1) Line items for lodging (attendee rooms, staff rooms and parking will be combined and line items for the event (required event space, to include audio visual and set-up requirements, catering requirements and parking) will be combined.  (2) If it is determined one vendor can meet all requirements (lodging and event) for the event and this vendor offers the overall lowest price, one award will be made to one vendor.  (3) If one vendor is not able to meet all requirements, one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for lodging and one award will be made to the LPTA vendor for the event. (4) An evaluation factor of $500.00 per award will be applied in determining if it is in the government's best interest from an administrative standpoint to make multiple awards. Vendors are not required to quote on both events.<br><br>To be determined technically acceptable, the following minimum requirements must be met for either area quoted:  <br><br>Group 1 (attendee lodging rooms, staff rooms, parking) (1) The quote must provide for all requirements within the group.  (2) The hotel facility proposed must provide guest informational service (i.e. front desk attendant, concierge service, etc.) 24 hours a day, (3) The hotel facility proposed must have on-site parking, or if off-site, valet services must be provided (4) The hotel facility proposed must be located in the area in or between Lexington, VA and Harrisonburg, VA along I81, or east on I64 from Staunton, VA to Richmond, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64) and (5) The hotel facility proposed must be FEMA approved.  In order to determine if minimum requirement (1) can be met, all services requested must either be priced or annotated as provided at no additional cost. For minimum requirements (2), (3), & (4) offeror must provide a fact sheet which addresses each minimum requirement.  The physical location of the proposed hotel facility must be provided to permit a determination to be made as if minimum requirement (4) can be met.  The lodging facility FEMA number must be provided to determine if requirement (5) can be met.  If information to address minimum requirements 2-5 is available on-line, a website address can be provided in lieu of the fact sheet.  <br><br>Group 2 (event space, catering and parking) (1) The quote must provide for all services within the group, (2) The event facility proposed must have on-site parking sufficient for all attendees, and (3) The event facility proposed must be located in the area in or between Lexington, VA and Harrisonburg, VA along I81, or east on I64 from Staunton, VA to Richmond, VA (from Route 288, north west to I64 and east to I295; from I295 north to I64) and.

<DESC>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695<br />Quotes will be accepted via e-mail at the above addresses, facsimile at 252-334-5427, or at the following address: <br />MEDIUM RANGE SURVEILLANCE (MRS)<br />USCG/CASA<br />AVIATION LOGISTICS CENTER (ALC)<br />ELIZABETH CITY, NC 27909</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.369</p>

 The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge.

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.
 This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.

(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
 [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.]

APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES
Proposals received without the completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3 may be considered non-compliant. Beginning January 1, 2005, the FAR requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.
 ORCA also allows Government personnel to access your information online, thus eliminating the need for you to submit representations and certifications with each offer. To register in ORCA you will need an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire. The questionnaire is to help you gather information you need for the clauses.
 The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully. The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status. Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov/help.aspx . Full text of FAR and DFARS provisions and clauses may be accessed at http://www.farsite.hill.af.mil/vffara.htm and ttp://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFDFARA.HTM , respectively.

(b) To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements. To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document.

The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.

(b) To comply with this statute, the Government has conducted a best efforts screening of the specifications and standards associated with this acquisition to determine whether they contain any ODS requirements. To the extent that ODS requirements were revealed by this review, they are identified in Section C or the statement of work of this document. (c) If offerors possess any special knowledge about any other ODS required directly or indirectly at any level of contract performance, the U.S. Army would appreciated if such information was surfaced to the Contracting Officer for appropriate action. To preclude delay to the procurement, offerors should provide any information as soon as possible after release of the solicitation and prior to the submission of offers to the extent practicable. It should be understood that there is no obligation on offerors to comply with this request and that no compensation can be provided for doing so.<BR><BR>Manufacturer or supplier must ensure that all OSHA standards applicable to that which is being purchased are complied with.<BR><BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>Contractor SHALL provide the approved water distributor's name, address, and inspection responsibility code (IRC) with the bid. The water source must be approved and listed on the U.S. Army Medical Department/U.S. Army Veterinary Command Approved Sources list. This list is a comprehensive list of sanitarily approved food establishments and sources that may be utilized to provide services to the U.S. Government.

<DESC><strong>This project has been deferred and a solicitation should&nbsp;be prepared and posted to FBO by this office within 60 days of this date (8 Feb 2012) <br /></strong>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Hill AFB anticipates the formation of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a 5 year continuous ordering period for the repair, installation, and alteration of built up bituminous roofing. To include but not limited to built-up roofing systems (minimum of 20yr manufacturer warranty is mandatory), lightning protection systems (master lightning protection license required), abatement for roofing containing asbestos, metal roofing repairs, flashing, and other roofing repairs on an as needed basis.<br /><br />Davis Bacon Act will apply to this acquisition and current wage rates found on WDOL applicable to each trade will apply.<br /><br />&nbsp;This IDIQ is anticipated to be a competitive Hubzone set-aside per the SBA and is expected to be solicited at the end of April. Anticipated ceiling amount for the 5yr IDIQ will be between $5-10M. This requirement will have a "seed" project sent out with the requirement specific statement of work (SOW) and will be posted as a request for proposals (RFP). This will require a technical volume to be submitted with the pricing and is expected to be evaluated as lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) with Past Performance. The RFP will also include the generalized IDIQ SOW for review by all interested contractors. <br /><br />This contract will be to perform built-up roofing repairs, mainly by replacement, at Hill AFB, Little Mountain Complex, and the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR), UT. Contractor shall be responsible for providing all materials, labor, management, licensing, certifications, supervision, equipment, transportation, and vehicles for each task order placed on this IDIQ. Manufacturer and National Roofing Contractors Association (NRCA) roof detail work shall be adhered to by the contractor. Built up roofing (BUR) manufacturer certification is a qualification to propose for this contract.<br /><br />Submittal #1 shall be executed and included with the proposal to the Air Force. Prior to proposing on the solicitation (or included in the proposal) the contractor shall provide proof that they are certified by the manufacturer. Failure to provide the required certification will result in a non-responsive proposal and will not be considered for award.<br /><br />FAR Clause 52.232-18 entitled "Availability of Funds" applies to the seed project. Site visit will be coordinated for proposing on the seed project. No date or time is currently available for this site visit (expected one week after issuing solicitation). Project magnitude for seed project is $500,000.00-$1,000,000.00. The contractor shall also need to submit bonding capability documents that meet the aggregate and project amounts, backed by a bonding surety with an A.M. Best company rating of "A". Bonding will be required per task order and will not be a blanket bonding policy.<br /><br />All text above is subject to change once the requirement is firm and the seed project is known. This is only a brief overview of the requirement and how it will be competed. Please direct any questions or concerns to SSgt Ashton Jones or A1C Lei Yang.

<DESC><strong>THIS PROJECT IS NOW BEING HANDLED BY FEDERAL LANDS HIGHWAY DIVISION.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />New Solicitation Number DTFH70-12-B-00001<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROJECT, PLEASE CONTACT&nbsp;FEDERAL LANDS HIGHWAY DIVISION&nbsp;(360)619-7520&nbsp;OR E-MAIL&nbsp;wfl.contracts@dot.gov<br /><br /><br />In June of 2010, a storm caused an extremely high flow event in Eagle Creek, washing out the side slopes of the road in 3 areas on Forest Service Road 77: Mileposts 25.7, 26.3, and 28.1. This project is to repair the fill slopes utilizing riprap buttressing, an MSE wall, and placing backfill and aggregate surfacing. Development of the riprap and material sources are also included in this project. Final roadbed width shall generally be <br />16', plus curve or fill widening as designed.
<p>At milepost 25.7 and 26.3, large riprap shall be installed along the toe of the fill slope to stabilize the road and protect the slope during future storm events. This riprap shall be keyed into the streambed approximately 4' below the bottom. Backfill shall be hauled from material sources located on Forest Roads 7015075 or 6700140. Riprap shall be obtained from roadside rock outcrops located adjacent to Forest Road 77. If this material cannot be obtained by traditional ripping techniques (i.e., using an excavator or dozer), then controlled blasting shall be utilized. Drainage ditches along the cut sides shall be constructed to reduce the risk of slope failure in areas where culverts are located.</p>
<p>At milepost 28.1, a mechanically stabilized earth (MSE) wall shall be constructed on the fill side to reestablish road width and stabilize the road. The height of the wall shall be approximately 9 feet with a 9:1 batter at the front. Because the wall shall be constructed, no additional riprap is needed in this location. Backfill material for this location shall be obtained from the material source located on Forest Road 6700140. Guardrail may be required at this location due to the vertical drop-off for user safety.</p>

<CONTACT>Jeannie Tung
<DESC>The pre-solicitation notice has been modified to include the following early Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure notification:
The Government anticipates the award of an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract under which individual task orders will be issued. The primary method to avoid, neutralize or mitigate any potential OCOI will be to preclude a contractor from award of a task order that would result in a conflict. The following are clauses that will be in the solicitation, contract, and task orders to address potential OCOI. 
The provision entitled "ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION" (EPAAR 1552.209-72) will be included in Section K of the solicitation so offerors shall be required to certify, to the best of their knowledge and belief, that they are not aware of any information bearing on the existence of any significant potential organizational conflicts of interest. The provision entitled "ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST NOTIFICATION" (EPAAR 1552.209-70), also included in Section L of the solicitation, shall require the offeror to provide a disclosure statement in its proposal describing all relevant information concerning past, present or planned interests bearing on whether it or any proposed subcontractors or consultants may have a potential organizational conflict of interest.
As required for all contracts in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold, the clause "ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST" (EPAAR 1552.209-71) will ensure detection of conflicts of interest that may arise during performance. In addition, clause "NOTIFICATION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST REGARDING PERSONNEL" (EPAR 1552.209-73) requires the contractor to notify the Government in the event a contract employee has a personal potential or actual conflict of interest.
The provision "MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR EPA CONTRACTOR'S CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLANS" presents the EPA's minimum standards for the offeror's development of a conflict of interest plan. Provision "SUBMISSION OF ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN" requires the offeror to submit their plan.
The following clauses will be included in the solicitation in Section H (Special Contract Requirements):
To address potential future COI issues, the clause "LIMITATION OF FUTURE CONTRACTING (ROC)" places limitations on when the contractor will be eligible for future contracts.  
"TASK ORDER CONFLICT OF INTEREST CERTIFICATION" With task order proposal submission, the contractor shall provide a conflict of interest certification. Where task orders are issued under the contract for work on or directly related to a site, the contractor is only required to provide a conflict of interest certification for the first task order issued for that site. For all subsequent work on that site, under the contract, the contractor has a continuing obligation to search and report any actual or potential conflicts of interest, but no additional conflict of interest certifications are required.
The contractor also will agree that if actual or potential OCOI are identified during performance of a related effort, it will make full disclosures in writing to the CO immediately. Disclosures shall include descriptions of actions which the contractors have taken or propose to take, after consultation with the CO, to avoid, neutralize or mitigate the conflict.   "PROJECT EMPLOYEE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT" (EPAAR 1552.227-76) requires the contractor to obtain employee confidentiality agreements from all employees working on requirements under this contract, and prohibits disclosure of site specific cost information or any enforcement strategy.
The solicitation will also include the "REGIONAL CROSSOVER" clause which will allow the Government to use other ROC contractors whenever an OCOI exists during contract performance; and cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated. 
Furthermore, the following restrictions will be included in the solicitation in Section M (Evaluation Factors for Award):
The provision "EVALUATION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST PLAN" specifies that the offeror's COI plan will be evaluated as part of a responsibility determination, and will be evaluated as either acceptable or not acceptable.  In accordance with FAR 9.504(e), before determining to withhold award based on conflict of interest considerations, the CO shall notify the offeror and allow it a reasonable opportunity to respond.  A proposal with a submitted COI plan determined to be unacceptable at time of award shall be ineligible for award.
In addition, the solicitation requires that the offeror to submit with its proposal a site-specific disclosure notification in accordance with the provision "DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (DEVIATION)" to help the Government evaluate actual and potential conflicts prior to award.  The solicitation will identify the following Federal facilities where work is expected to be performed during the period of performance of the contract:
1. Brookhaven National Labs, Upton, New York,2. Coast Guard Facilities throughout New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands,3. Culebra Island, Puerto Rico,4. FAA Technical Center, Atlantic County, New Jersey,5. Flamingo Bay Test Areas,6. Formerly Used Defense Sites throughout New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands,7. Fort Allen, Puerto Rico,8. Griffiss Air Force Base, Rome, New York,9. UST Facilities throughout New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands,10. Maywood Chemical Works,  Bergen County, New Jersey,11. McGuire Air Force Base, Burlington County, New Jersey,12. Middlesex Sampling Plant, Middlesex, New Jersey,13.

Seneca Army Depot, Romulus, New York,17. Somerville Depot, Somerville, New Jersey,18. USPS JAF Building, New York, New York, and19. Vieques Island, Puerto Rico
Besides the site-specific disclosure notification requirements above, a potential OCOI may exist with offerors that have significant overall business relationships with certain Federal departments responsible for the sites listed above. Offerors responding to this solicitation are required to disclose such business relationships and provide the following information: 
Total Revenue and Percentage of Total Corporate Revenue from the following Federal Departments:	Department of Defense (proper) 		Department of Navy 		Department of Army		Department of the Air Force 		Department of Energy		Federal Aviation Administration		U.S. Coast Guard		U.S. Postal Service		
EPA will have the opportunity to assess its vulnerabilities relative to OCOI of individual offerors prior to award of the ROC-4 contract.  As part of the pre-award responsibility determination, EPA will review this information and determine if the volume of the disclosed work, if any, poses any significant conflicts.  Offerors that have significant COI will be notified and afforded the opportunity to provide a plan to avoid, neutralize or mitigate the conflicts.  If an offeror cannot avoid, neutralize or mitigate identified conflicts, then it will be ineligible for award.
The provision "EVALUATION OF ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE STATEMENT" specifies that the offeror?s disclosure statement will be evaluated as either acceptable or not acceptable. A proposal with a submitted disclosure statement determined to be unacceptable at time of award shall be ineligible for award.

<DESC>If you have any questions, you may contact Ms. Ashlee Gray, US Army Corps of Engineers, Real Estate Division (817-886-1106, Ashlee.L.Gray@usace.army.mil).<br><br><br>The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), by request of the United States Army, issues this Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to determine if an interested builder is qualified to provide and operate one NetZero Complex incorporating energy, water and waste solutions for energy efficient housing to accommodate enlisted families and one multifamily net zero plus community to accommodate Soldiers of all ranks at Fort Bliss Army Installation. <br>The Army is interested in the construction of one planned Net Zero Plus Water, Energy and Waste Community development consisting of a minimum of 1,800 single family homes with 3-5 bedrooms, including community amenities, and a separate Net Zero Plus Water, Energy and Waste multi-family development consisting of a minimum of 500 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartment style units to be occupied by single/married Soldiers with no dependants. Construction of the housing developments must meet the standards for the Residential Communities Initiative (RCI) Family Housing Program. Additional information regarding RCI, as well as construction standards, can be found at http://www.rci.army.mil/. Both communities must incorporate community amenities that address quality of life components associated with recreation such as pools, libraries, retail spaces, landscaped common use outdoor spaces and pedestrian friendly environments.  At a minimum, LEED Silver must be met. However, higher LEED levels are encouraged. In addition, innovative ways should be considered to use for Army purposes excess renewable energy produced by the net zero communities.  Pursuant to Title 10 USC 2836, the above mentioned developments will be provided by a lease arrangement with selected builder for no longer than 25 years. Because the housing facilities will be private rentals, Soldiers will receive Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) for payment of the leased units. Soldiers' BAH will be based on their rank and/or number of dependents. The expected BAH for Soldiers occupying single family dwellings will be a minimum of $1,023.
