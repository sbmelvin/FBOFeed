<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for a NASA-Wide Agency License for the 2004 Linkage Excellence in Management and Leadership Series Live via satellite and videoconferenceing.  The license will allow all NASA centers to downlink the series with no restrictions on the number of attendees viewing the program. NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from Linkage, Inc., Lexington MA as the only known source who can meet agency requirements.  This satellite series includes presentations from top management and leadership experts.  This program is the only known satelite delivered management and leadership training program that will allow NASA managers and supervisors to interact with experts in the fields of management and leadership.  It would take substantial duplication of time and effort for another company to offer a similar product that would meet this requirement and these costs are not expected to be recovered through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on 2-5-04.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

B. Full text of announcement
I.  Funding Opportunity Description 
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) is soliciting proposals for the first phase of a new program in Architectures for Cognitive Information Processing (ACIP).  The goal of the ACIP program is to develop a new generation of computing architectures (both hardware and software) that will enable revolutionary advances in cognitive information processing algorithms and systems for real-time DoD applications.
Current systems implementations of cognitive information processing typically rely on COTS processing elements originally designed for general-purpose data processing. To enable the effective deployment of powerful cognitive information processing systems in dynamic, real-time, data-intensive, multiple-mission-specific environments requires fundamental changes in system architecture components and integration. The ACIP program seeks to address this issue by developing processing architectures that are uniquely optimized for cognitive computing. Further, these solutions must be developed such that their future embedded implementation in DoD platforms and devices will be compatible with size, weight, and power constraints, and thus must be composed of highly integrated and efficient cognitive computing components and devices.
This announcement addresses Phase I of what is anticipated to be a three phase program. Phase I is a comprehensive concept study comprising requirement analysis, concept development and analysis, and technology assessment, all in the context of representative challenge problem(s). Specifically, Phase I will address the following technical topics:
(a)	the definition of cognitive information processing components, algorithms, and systems to be considered;
(b)	their architectural, computing and memory resource, communication bandwidth, and run-time requirements (this should include identification of key computational,  memory, and communication bottlenecks, as well as dynamic run-time requirements);
(c)	advanced architecture concepts, goal-oriented programming techniques, models, and evaluation methodologies for addressing these requirements and identified bottlenecks, and for assessing the quality of the proposed solution; and
(d)	a complete technology roadmap for research and development leading to deployed cognitive information processing systems on dedicated computing architecture for multiple DoD missions.
This announcement solicits advanced architectural concepts that are thoroughly validated through analysis. Offerors should propose studies that address both cognitive information processing and advanced computer architectures with the following tightly-interrelated study components:
1.	A representative set of DoD relevant challenge problems that fairly represent the key classes of reasoning, learning, and knowledge representation techniques that may be used in fully integrated cognitive systems.
2.	A description of a cognitive information processing system that addresses the above challenge problems and is sufficiently general to be applicable to a wide range of cognitive applications.
3.	A robust concept description of an integrated architecture, including hardware and software, that will efficiently support the proposed cognitive information processing system as well as a wide variety of other run-time components.
4.	A detailed plan that elaborates how the cognitive information processing system and integrated architecture can be designed and implemented in a synergistic fashion to produce  revolutionary architectural concepts and implementations, describes the members and roles of a multi-disciplinary team for execution, provides a detailed evaluation framework, success criteria, and milestones. 
As stated above, the proposed cognitive challenge problems must have sufficient diversity and scope to enable revolutionary progress in both high-level algorithms and in computing architectures. The desire is to have a cognitive computing architecture that will support a reasonable spectrum of reasoning, learning, and knowledge representation techniques yet not so general purpose as to prohibit the end product’s practical use in embedded applications. Example reasoning, learning, and knowledge representation tasks could include (but are not limited to) the following:
1.	Reasoning on large-scale problems. Various reasoning techniques, including resolution theorem proving; forward chaining, including RETE-type algorithms; backward chaining; logic programming; greedy local search for propositional satisfiability; and others have been developed. Typically, these techniques exhibit exponential behavior on the size of the input. Methods for effectively parallelizing such techniques or methods for applying dynamic reconfigurable architectures to increase the size of addressable problems are of interest.
2.	Reasoning and inference on large knowledge bases.  This might include parallel mechanisms for accelerating reasoning on large structures, techniques for mapping among and integrating disparate ontologies dealing with overlapping domains, methods for automatically incorporating new facts and verifying their self-consistency, partitioning and distributing knowledge bases across processor elements, using very large main memory to store intermediate results (trading space for time), implementing solutions to commonly occurring sub-problems in dedicated hardware, and others.
3.	Reasoning under uncertain conditions or under constrained reaction times.  Approaches might include decision- and probability-theoretic techniques, inference using Bayesian networks, hidden Markov models, qualitative and default reasoning, belief (or loopy) propagation, and relational dependency networks, among others. 
4.	Planning and resource management in dynamically changing environments. Approaches could include state-space search, partial-order planning, scheduling with resource constraints, hierarchical planning, conditional and continuous planning, and multi-agent planning. 
5.	Learning, with prior knowledge, in complex, multi-dimensional environments.  Learning is a rich and critical area with many techniques and approaches, including concept learning, learning decision trees, probabilistic relational models, artificial neural networks, Bayesian learning, instance-based learning, genetic algorithms, and combined inductive and analytical learning.  Hybrid approaches that integrate multiple learning techniques with reasoning and knowledge representations to synergistically improve both knowledge and learning are of interest.
It is anticipated that for some of the above tasks, processing bottlenecks could include search operations, graph operations, data-driven training, front-end perceptual processing, and other operations.  Memory access times and memory size may be major factors in scaling up to large-scale problems and systems.  In addition, production systems may demand late or dynamic bindings.
Because cognitive algorithms typically provide solutions that do not scale well with problem size, this announcement seeks solutions that offer a synergistic combination of both algorithmic and architectural innovations.  It is not sufficient to propose architectural solutions that modestly accelerate processing or memory access times for current cognitive systems (e.g., by factors of 10 - 100).  Proposed solutions must address ambitious, real world DoD applications, of appropriate scale and complexity, that are beyond the scope of today’s technology and may also require the use of  emerging innovative reasoning, knowledge representation, and learning techniques or components.
Offerors should provide a complete description of the proposed system architecture, from innovative compute cores, cache and other memory structures, and interconnects/connectivity structures to operating system, languages, and programming environments that will efficiently support a dynamic and diverse set of runtime-directed cognitive components.   The proposed solution should offer a deeply integrated co-design of computing architecture, programming models, multiple virtual machine models, supporting software, and specific driving application requirements, but should be sufficiently general to address a range of applications.  Please reference the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) for the envisioned solutions.
Consideration should be given to novel scalable parallel processing concepts; large-scale intelligent memory structures; in-place, fast, data-structured memory access and computation; power-minimization techniques; embeddable packaging; and system scaling.
An important element of the ACIP program is the Living Framework Forum (LFF), which will be established during the program to promote and pursue common cognitive computing development environments, tools, common runtime module interfaces and metadata structures across multiple ACIP efforts.  
ACIP research efforts will be executed in the context of representative cognitive challenge problems.    Offerors must address two or more well-defined DoD cognitive applications, including one embedded application for in-context evaluation of proposed solutions. See PIP for examples of representative challenge problems.

TEST AND EVALUATION.  Performers will test and evaluate their technologies using their own facilities and report results at ACIP PI meetings, potential IPTO sponsored cognitive workshops, and Living Framework Forums. Within each effort, the performer must quantify the capability to be realized through the proposed cognitive architecture concepts.  Specific multilevel metrics and goals relevant to DoD missions and the cognitive functional component requirements, constraints, and development goals being pursued must be established.  Advances in cognitive computing capabilities must be quantified against today’s systems.  Concise clearly stated Phase I success criteria and metrics must be spelled out in the proposal and will be used to track the maturity of the concepts developed under Phase I.
An Independent Metrics and Evaluation Team (IMET) will be formed to work with the ACIP teams to develop a common set of spanning kernels and metrics.  This will enable a common evaluation process and analysis/evaluation for the ACIP program supported by this common library of kernels and metrics.  All ACIP contractors will be expected to work collaboratively with this separately funded and neutral ACIP effort.   

PROGRAM SCOPE DARPA. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art. Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered. However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in minor evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on special-purpose systems or narrow applications. 

The full ACIP program is anticipated to be comprised of three phases: 1) Early Architecture Concepts and In-Context Evaluation, 24 months; 2) Full-Scale Implementation and Demonstration, 48 months; 3) Cognitive Technology System Transitions to DoD, 24 months. The Phase I deliverables are defined in the Proposer Information Pamphlet .

II. Award Information 
Awards for Phase I efforts are expected to be made during the first half of calendar year 2004.  It is anticipated that there will be multiple awards for ACIP Phase I.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants
Proposers should propose a multi-organizational but integrated team comprising a Lead Study Integration (LSI) function and a set of Technology Contributors (TC's). Since this is a concept development effort, innovative teaming strategies that maximize overall team efficiency are strongly encouraged.  The LSI should provide overall project management, system integration, and concept evaluation and validation.  Offerors should propose a well-balanced team that fully covers the topics of interest in this BAA and that provides appropriate diversity within each topic area.
All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities.
Awards made under this BAA may be subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 2.101, must be disclosed in Section II, I. of the proposal, organized by task and year.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.  
2.  Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program; however, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

IV. Application and Submission Information

1.  Address to Request Application Package

This announcement contains all information required to submit a proposal.  No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.  [NOTE:  See Paragraph 6, “Other Submission Requirements,” for reference to the PIP.]

2.  Content and Form of Application Submission
This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) requires completion of a BAA Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  This cover sheet can be accessed at the following URL:
http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=04-14

After finalizing the BAA Cover Sheet, the proposer must print the BAA Confirmation Sheet that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  If a proposer intends on submitting more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
SECURITY INFORMATION
NOTE:  The Government anticipates that proposals submitted under this BAA will be unclassified.  In the event that a proposer chooses to submit a classified proposal or submit any documentation that may be classified, the following information is applicable.
Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that the award instrument may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued and attached as part of the award.  Proposers choosing to submit a classified proposal must first receive permission from the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  Applicable classification guide(s) should be submitted to ensure that the proposal is protected appropriately.  
NEW REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report.  These reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).
PROPOSAL FORMAT

<DESC>NASA/HQ's Office of Education, Elementary and Secondary Education Division, Code NS, announces a Cooperative Agreement Notice (CAN) soliciting proposals to establish collaboration between NASA and a host organization to continue developing and implementing the NASA Student Involvement Program (NSIP). The NSIP serves as a major national educational program that addresses the widespread need for greater scientific, technological, engineering, and mathematical (STEM) literacy among American students. NSIP is a program of six competitions directly linking students in grades K-12 with NASA's mission of exploration, research, and discovery. Students prepare entries as individuals, as teams, or as a class, depending on the competition category and grade level. The NSIP is an enrichment experience for both students and teachers.  The program provides educators with instructional material and classroom-ready resources that support an inquiry-based approach to science, math, technology, engineering, and geography education. In preparing their investigations for submission to NSIP, students sharpen their skills in inquiry, problem solving, and creative writing.  In order to keep all research timely and applicable, NASA is seeking a partner with education service experience to design competitions that focus on upcoming or existing missions within the NASA Enterprises.  More information on this year's competition is available on the NSIP website: http://education.nasa.gov/nsip. Each NSIP competition category has a Resource Guide that provides instructional materials, tips, and resources for use in investigations and design challenges. These materials support national standards, state frameworks, and local school curricula.  NASA plans a synergistic program that focuses on NASA's missions, facilities, human resources, and programs that will provide information, experience, and research opportunities for students and support the enhancement of knowledge and skills in the STEM fields. NASA seeks a partner with the infrastructure and credentials to support a national science based student involvement program for participants ranging from Kindergarten through Grade 12. The program will reach into all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in schools of United States overseas civil and military establishments, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and outlying United States territories. Our partner will develop, implement, enhance, and administer an innovative educational program and approach that will: (a) involve a great diversity of participation among schools, students and teachers; (b) balance gender participation and increase ethnic diversity of competitors; and (c) provide age appropriate experiences that uses scientific inquiry and critical thinking skills to positively influence student learning. This notice represents an effort to develop a program that encourages all students to work toward scientific literacy through motivating competitions on aerospace topics. More information on the current program can be found at:  http://education.nasa.gov/nsip Only one cooperative agreement will be awarded as a result of this notice.  Participation is open to all firms, partnerships, and consortia. Recipients shall not be paid a profit.    The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item or service using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. The anticipated release date of the CAN is January 23, 2004 with a proposal due date of March 3, 2004. The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available on the NASA Headquarters Web site:  http://education.nasa.gov/nsip	Prospective offerors shall notify this office of their intent to submit an offer.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Any referenced notes can be viewed at the following URL:  http://genesis.gsfc.nasa.gov/nasanote.html This solicitation leading to the award of a Cooperative Agreement is issued pursuant to title 14 CFR Part 1260 for educational and nonprofit institutions and 14 CFR part 1274 for commercial organizations.

A fixed price type contract is contemplated for three years with the inclusion of options to extend the contract to a total of ten years.  An award fee clause based on delivery performance will be included.   

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the
purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application. The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation. To request this certification, write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or  call DLSC at the above number.

Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  

Specifications, plans, or drawings relating to the procurement described are incomplete or not available and cannot be furnished by the Government.


Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified above for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition. If your concerns are not satisfied by the contacting officer, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear serious concerns that are not resolved through established channels. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate serious contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. When appropriate, potential offerors may contact Ombudsman Kathy Cames, Chief, Contract Policy Division, at 912-926-2604.

Basic Quantity: 2 EA First Articles; 74 EA Production Units. Mission Essential Quantity (MEQ) 76 EA; Outyear Production Option I Quantity 80 EA; Outyear Production Option II Quantity 80 EA.  This is a competitive acquisition with an Insurance Policy Buy for the MEQ to one of the proven sources, Tyco Backplanes Inc, Stafford Springs, CT, or Custom Manufacturing & Engineering, Saint Petersburg, FL.  This acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5352.217-9006 (Award of MEQ): The government has determined that a break in supply of this item (that is, failure to deliver due to timeliness and/or conformance) would jeopardize support to operational units' mission capabilities.  Additionally, the item is of such complexity and/or so critical that firt article testing measures are required for all unproven sources to ensure that the unproven source is capable of producing a conforming part.  Therefore, the government reserves the right to award the MEQ and, if necessary, the remaining balance of the requirement, to a proven source.  In such event, the proven source must be a responsive, responsible offeror and also be the lowest in price of all proven offerors, price and price related factors considered. Therefore, two contract line items are provided to correspond with each of the two alternatives.  
The approximate solicitation issue date will be 28 Nov 03, with the approximate response date of 29 Dec 03.  Request solicitation from Don Howard, WR-ALC/LSKT, 265 Perry St, Robins AFB, GA, 31098-1607; email don.howard@robins.af.mil.  Solicitation will be posted on the Web at http://pkec.robins.af.mil.

The requirement is for engineering support to modify, upgrade, and improve existing CACE software tools, and for management support of the CACE Program Manager at Marine Corps Systems Command.  The basis for this sole source award is that   COSYS has signed agreements with universities giving them exclusive rights/first right of refusal to convert the developmental software into a commercial product.  These universities own the intellectual property rights to that developmental software, and the Government owns the software itself.  No solicitation document exists for this effort at this time.  Anticipated contract award date is 3rd quarter FY04.  Interested parties may submit a written statement of capability for satisfying this requirement to the name and address identified above within 15 days.  See numbered note 22.

OFFERORS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AND INCLUDE A COPY OF THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WITH THEIR PROPOSALS: FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications -  Commercial Items. The government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the government considering price and price-related factors. Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies with paragraph (a) completed as follows: Award will be made to the offeror that meets the solicitation's minimum criteria for technical acceptability at the lowest price. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers. (Factor 1) To be determined technically acceptable, the offeror must furnish product literature that demonstrates the products offered meet all requirements stated in the above purchase descriptions for Line Items 0001.  (Factor 2) Past Performance, contractors to submit previous three (3) contract numbers, names of agencies/companies and contacts for past three years.  (Factor 3) price  Of ferors' proposals will be evaluated first under factor 1 above, which represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, products offered will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to meet the minimum criteria for this factor will render the offer to be technically unacceptable and to not be considered for award. See paragraph b below. Only those offers which meet the minimum technical requirements required by Factor 1 will be further evaluated under Factors 2 and 3.  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor 1 to be technically acceptable., Factor 2 is approximately equal to Factor 3, price. At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's be st terms from both a price and technical standpoint. (b) Technical capability of proposed item to meet the requirement, Factor 1, will be assessed by evaluating either commercial product brochures or technical information submitted in response to FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to offerors - commercial items, subparagraph (b) 4 which is incorporated by reference in this solicitation.  Offerors' technical information will be used to determine whether the items proposed meet the specifications included in this solicitation.  Items offered, as provided in Offerors' technical information, will be evaluated as technically acceptable or technical unacceptable.  Offers which are determined to be technically  unacceptable may not be considered further for award. © Offeror's Past Performance information submitted as required by FAR Clause 52.212-1, instructions to Offerors - Com mercial items, Subparagraph (6) 10, will be used  to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years.  Past Performance information should be provided on the form provided as in attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information. Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared  to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's past performance as follows: Neutral:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. Outstanding:  No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degration of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. Satisfactory:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. Marginal:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past  performance. (d) Options:  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (e) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (of part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of  withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>The Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (DESPR/NICHD) is planning to award a contract for a program entitled, “LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF THE ESTROGEN AND PROGESTERONE EFFECTS ON BIOMARKERS OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND ANTIOXIDANT STATUS DURING THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE.”  The NICHD seeks a contractor capable of establishing a longitudinal cohort study to determine the pre-menopausal cyclic relationship between oxidative stress biomarkers and hormonal fluctuations in order to analyze their effect on women’s reproductive health and disease.  Recent animal and human studies suggest that oxidative stress might be implicated in the risk of female infertility through associations with follicular growth, the development of endometriosis, and regulation of angiogenesis in the endometrium, but the mechanisms are not completely understood.  Although it is known that micronutrient antioxidants, hormones, and enzymatic antioxidants are able to neutralize oxygen free radicals and inhibit oxidation, the use of these therapies to reduce the risk of infertility has been limited by a lack of basic understanding.  THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT ARE: (i) to study the intra-cycle variation of oxidative stress during menstruation; (ii) to determine the relationship between sex-hormones and oxidative stress during the menstrual cycle in pre-menopausal women; (iii) to examine the influence of external factors such as over-the-counter medications, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and exercise on oxidative stress and hormone levels; and (iv) to evaluate the validity and reliability of biomarkers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status in blood and urine.  To meet these objectives, a prospective longitudinal cohort study is being designed.  An estimated total of approximately 260 pre-menopausal, healthy (chlamydia-free) women will be required to participate in this study.   To receive consideration for a contract award, an offeror must be able to: 1) Demonstrate a clear understanding of menstrual function and its relation to oxidative stress, including the potential role of environmental factors, biological variability and laboratory measurements; 2) Provide evidence of a solid understanding regarding the utility and feasibility of a longitudinal design for empirically assessing the relation between biomarkers of oxidative stress, lifestyle factors and human reproduction and development; and, 3) Provide evidence of an ability to: a) identify, recruit and retain participants; b) collect longitudinal data and biologic specimens using quality assurance procedures (include information on what quality assurance procedures have been/will be used); and c) establish and comply with a study protocol in collaboration with the NICHD.  

The required service is defined as code 541990 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available on or before January 23, 2004 through the web site at http://FedBizOpps.gov .  All responses must be submitted on or before March 23, 2004, to:  Robert Stallings, Contract Specialist, NICHD, CMB, 6100 Building, Suite 7A07, 6100 EXECUTIVE BLVD MSC 7510, BETHESDA MD 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A07, Rockville, MD  20852).  Questions may be directed to: Robert Stallings, Contract Specialist, by telephone (301) 435-6965; FAX 301-402-3676; or e-mail bs79d@nih.gov.  Fully electronic copies will not be accepted, but portions of the proposal may be provided on disc.  The reference number to be used for this announcement is:  RFP NICHD-2004-01.  All correspondence must cite the reference number as provided.  The resultant contract is anticipated to have duration of two years.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 2213   Request for Price Quotes:                                             Hourly Rate plus Expenses                                          	STATEMENT OF WORK 	Field Support for Eastern Wyoming 	Public Water System Regulatory Program Purpose 	The purpose of this contract  is to procure field services for the Wyoming public water system (PWS) regulatory program in the eastern and northeastern sections of Wyoming. Background 	The National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (40 CFR Part 141) require all public water systems (PWSs) to routinely monitor for  microbiological, chemical and radionuclide contaminants, and to meet certain treatment technique requirements.  The PWS regulatory program for Wyoming is implemented by the U. S. EPA Region 8 office in Denver, Colorado. 	As the implementing agency for the Wyoming PWS regulatory program, EPA  Region 8 has several responsibilities.  Some of these require personnel to make site visits to Wyoming PWSs, or conduct  meetings with Wyoming's state and local environmental or public health agency officials.   For example: (1)	EPA is required to ensure that sanitary surveys are conducted at  each PWS within specified regulatory time-frames.  A sanitary survey is a thorough on-site review of PWS facilities, operation, maintenance and management that emphasizes technical assistance rather than enforcement.  Sanitary surveys also require collection and interpretation of select information  before the on-site visit. (2)	As part of a technical assistance effort, EPA Regional staff or contractors may collect water samples for microscopic particulate analysis (MPA).  These MPA samples are used to determine whether a PWS using a ground water source might be "under the direct influence of  surface water." (3)	When a PWS is having problems with microbiological, chemical, or radionuclide contamination, the operator often asks EPA for assistance in correcting the problem.  The assistance may necessitate a visit to the PWS. (4)	There may be some small water systems in Wyoming that meet  the definition of a public water system, but have not notified or been recognized by EPA.  These systems need to be identified and their names entered into the PWS regulatory database at EPA. (5)	There have been several new Safe Drinking Water Act amendments enacted with new requirements for  public water systems.  Water system operators may need on-site technical assistance and training to comply with the new requirements. (6)	Some state, county, and local environmental and public health agencies also have regulatory authority that applies to water systems in Wyoming.  On occasion,  staff 	from these agencies have requested training on drinking water topics.  It is in the interest of EPA Region 8 to provide this training to help ensure that all agencies work together in a coordinated manner. (7)	On occasion, it is necessary to confirm that a PWS has actually completed all the  steps necessary to allow it to be "deactivated" (i.e., no longer meets the legal definition of a "public water system").  It is also occasionally necessary to confirm that a PWS has completed all of the actions mandated in an administrative order.  In both instances, the best way to make these  confirmations is to visit the facility, take photographs, and possibly collect water samples. (8)	As appropriate, EPA Region 8 also investigates problems at private residences, or at facilities too small to meet the legal definition of a public water system.  Regional staff provide technical  assistance to help these small water systems correct any water quality problems. 	Because EPA Region 8 offices are located in Denver, it is difficult to send Agency  personnel to Wyoming in every instance one of these actions are needed.  For this              reason, the Region is soliciting  proposals from contractors to perform this work. The majority of the work will be located in the eastern and northeastern sections of Wyoming. Responsibilities 	The contractor will receive written (FAXed or e-mailed) assignments from the contract's Work Assignment Manager or their  designee from  the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit for the some or all of the following four tasks: (1)	Site visits to public water systems to conduct sanitary surveys. 	At the beginning of the contract year, the Work Assignment Manager or their  designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit will  send the contractor a list of Wyoming PWSs that must have sanitary surveys completed.  After receiving the list, the contractor will conduct the sanitary surveys at the assigned facilities and prepare a written report for each one.  The scheduling of these survey visits is left to the discretion of  the contractor.  However, EPA reserves the right to designate certain surveys as "high priority".  "High priority" surveys must be completed as soon as possible.  All of the sanitary survey visits must be completed by the end of the purchase order.  	The contractor will prepare a written report  for each sanitary survey.  The reports must have the following features: ?	They must use the current  standardized format specified by EPA Region 8, and  must be provided in Microsoft Word or WordPerfect format. ?	They must include at least one color photo of each source, treatment and storage  facility at the public water system. ?	They must include an updated schematic of the PWS, which shows any changes made in system configurations.  EPA Region 8 will provide the contractor with a paper copy of each schematic before the contractor makes the site visit.  It is then the responsibility  of the contractor to mark-up the schematic as appropriate, and get the PWS operator's signature on the page (to confirm that he/she agrees with the changes). ?	The text at the beginning of the report (the "summary" section) must include a brief summary of any deficiencies found at the facility,  and  recommendations on how to correct them. ?	For each sanitary survey completed at public water systems that use ground water, the contractor must fill out a "ground water under the direct influence of surface water" screening form.  The screening form will be provided by EPA. ?	For each  sanitary survey, the contractor must mark-up a PWS inventory summary form that will be provided by EPA. ?	Latitude/longitude measurements will be collected only if there has never been a measurement previously determined for a system's source(s), treatment facility(ies), and/or storage tank(s).   Measurements will only be recorded on the PWS inventory summary sheet.  The contractor must demonstrate to the Work Assignment Manager that they can collect latitude/longitude measurements to within 25 meters of accuracy. ?	Each sanitary survey report must be e-mailed to the contract's Work  Assignment Manager within 30 days after the site visit.  The accompanying photos can either be e-mailed (e.g., those from a digital camera) as a separate file attachment, or mailed.  The hand-corrected PWS schematics, inventory summary sheets, and any other pertinent information collected during  the survey, e.g. treatment equipment manufacturer's spec sheets,  must be mailed back to the Work Assignment Manager. ?	If, during a sanitary survey visit, the contractor discovers conditions at a public water system that could pose an immediate risk to public health, he/she will immediately  contact the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit by telephone to provide a report of the situation.  The contractor will also give highest priority to the completion of the sanitary survey report and relaying it to the Work Assignment Manager by  water systems to collect drinking water samples for microscopic particulate analysis.  After receiving a written work request from the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will collect the MPA samples using the protocols specified in  the "EPA Consensus Method."  Each sample takes approximately 8 - 10 hours to collect.  Once the sample is collected, the contractor will package it and either hand-deliver or mail it to a certified laboratory (one that has been approved by EPA to conduct the analysis).  For each site visit, the  contractor will prepare a brief (i.e., no more than one page) report using a form approved by EPA.  The reports will be sent to EPA within 30 days after the site visits.  (NOTE: The public water system pays the lab costs for the MPA analysis.  It is understood that the lab may send the results to  EPA later than the 30-day deadline.) (3)	Technical assistance visits to public water systems that are having problems.  After receiving a work request verbally or in writing from the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will visit a  facility to provide technical assistance.  Examples of possible problems include microbiological contamination in the system; failure to maintain adequate disinfectant residual; and failure to meet the Surface Water Treatment Rule turbidity criteria.  The contractor will assess the problem and  offer suggestions on how to make corrections. 	For each site visit, the contractor will prepare a brief report (i.e., no more than 2 pages) for EPA.  These reports will include findings and suggestions on how to correct problems at the facility.  The reports will be sent to EPA within 30 days  	after the site visit. 	On occasion, the contractor may receive a written request to visit a water system that does not meet the legal definition of a public water system, but requires technical assistance to address drinking water problems.  In these instances, the contractor will visit the  facility, offer advice on how to correct the problem, and prepare a brief report for the Work Assignment Manager. (4)	Identification of potential PWSs that are not currently on EPA's inventory of regulated systems.  This task can be accomplished while traveling to assigned sites.  Here, the  contractor is requested to watch for any new facility developments that might meet the definition of a public water system, and to report these systems to EPA.  (EPA will provide the contractor with a current list of existing PWSs.) (5)	Training and technical assistance on SDWA Amendments.  After  receiving a written work request from the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from 	the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will provide training or technical assistance to PWSs that are striving to meet new drinking water regulatory requirements.  After each training or  technical assistance visit, the 	contractor will send the Work Assignment Manager written confirmation (preferably an e-mail) that the assignment was completed and a description of the training provided. (6)	Training for state and local agency personnel.  At the written request of the Work  Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will conduct one or more training sessions for state and local agency personnel on selected drinking water topics.  Examples include:  collecting total coliform samples; chemical monitoring  requirements for PWSs. (7)	Site visits to confirm completion of specified actions.  After receiving a work request verbally or in writing from the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems Unit, the contractor will visit 	PWS facilities, take photos and  collect other pertinent information to confirm that a PWS has completed the actions either: (1) mandated in a administrative order; or (2) necessary to allow that PWS to be deactivated.  The contractor will send EPA a summary report within 30 days after the visit. Request for Price Quotes (Hourly  Rate plus Expenses): 	EPA will review and evaluate proposals and make the contract award based upon the applicant's ability to meet the EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA, stated below.  This program is competitive, and eligible applicants that can demonstrate that they meet the Criteria may apply.  	EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA 	All proposals will be evaluated according to the following criteria.  1.	Demonstrated experience of the applicant in conducting sanitary surveys. 2.	Experience and knowledge of water system operations and maintenance, and small government public works  administration. 3.	Because some drinking water facility problems can be an emergency public health concern, technical assistance may be required on 24 hours notice.  Therefore, preference will be given to companies or offices located within the Wyoming state boundaries. 4.	Cost:  Please provide  the fully loaded hourly rate for each task listed above   If the contract has multiple hourly rates, list the hours per each rate. 5.	List any subcontractors that will be used for this contract, including their experience in the criteria listed above.   6.	Familiarity with the National Primary  Drinking Water Regulations   (40 CFR Part 141). End of Contract Reporting 	At the end of the contract period, the contractor will prepare a brief (i.e. 2-3 pages) report summarizing how many tasks were completed under each of the areas of responsibility listed above.  Additional reporting  requirements are specified under specific areas of responsibility. Additional Requirements (1)	For all site visits, the contractor will inform the PWS operator that they are contract employees (not EPA employees) who have been hired by EPA to provide various forms of technical assistance.  Due to  increased security considerations, contractors should carry and present EPA credentials at the time of their visit to the PWS.  At all times, the contractor will be courteous to the PWS operators and will suggest, but not insist, that the PWS operators follow advice given during the visit.  (2)	If  the contractor observes that a PWS is not complying with any of the drinking water regulations or, if conditions at the facility pose an immediate public health risk, the contractor will immediately inform the Work Assignment Manager or their designee from the EPA Region 8 Municipal Systems  Unit. (3)	Some verbal or written work requests will require an expedited response, particularly in the case of drinking water emergencies. (4)	All work performed by the contractor will be done in accordance with pertinent Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements. (5)	EPA may  require the contractor to travel to Denver near the beginning of the contract year to meet staff and review files of facilities where sanitary survey visits will be conducted. Past performance 	Provide three (3) of the most relevant and related references for similar work in terms of size and  scope over the past three years.  Provide the following information: (a) the name and address of the organization for which services were performed; (b) the current telephone number of a responsible technical representative of the organization and the current business contact; (c) the contract  number, if applicable; (d) the type of contract performed; and (e) a brief description of the services provided, including the length of performance and the total dollar amount. QUOTATION SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS 	Contractors shall prepare a succinct written proposal that addresses the work  described in the Statement of Work (technical approach), a schedule of deliverables and a budget.  As a guideline, quotations (not including resumes) should be no more than 20 pages, however, contractors shall not be penalized for exceeding 20 pages.

***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 60 days after receipt of order.

***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, the Government will consider responses received by February 4, 2004.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Specific scientific points of contact for each research area are identified on Page 1 of the BAA, as well as a detailed process that allows for an early determination of the potential for interest based on technical merit, applicability to the DMSO Modeling and Simulation (M&S) Program, and projected funding.  This process is designed to limit offeror and Government expenditure of effort to prepare and review formal proposals for research that may have little chance of being supported and consists of a technical dialog (telephone call to scientific point of contact and informal white paper submission), followed by formal proposal submission and contract award.  Those interested in performing research in the covered areas should download the BAA and initiate a technical dialog with the appropriate scientific point of contact.  Only questions regarding the BAA process itself should be addressed to the point of contact listed below.  This notice satisfies the requirement for annual synopsis.

PROJECT TITLE:  EUROPE REGIONAL: IT AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR DEFINITIONAL MISSION

1		SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility study or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative study or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4		provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues, as called for in Section C.

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT

Prior to departure to the host countries, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host countries of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S TRAVEL TO HOST COUNTRIES 

The Contractor shall travel to the host countries of Poland and Hungary to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy in each country.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3		provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues. 

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.3.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

Demand in Hungary’s IT sector has grown significantly from $1.3 billion in 2000 to $1.9 billion in 2003.  Much of this growth has been a result of privatization and limited competition in the telecommunications sector, which has increased the number of Internet users at a rate of 50 percent per year.

Hungary's Internet is highly advanced, even compared to most EU countries, however additional upgrades are needed.  Recognizing that economic development requires a modern IT network, the Government of Hungary has made it a priority to improve the country's voice and data capabilities. These investments present a good opportunity for U.S. companies to become involved as Hungary accelerates its IT efforts over the next 3-5 years.  Major investments include IT security and data protection, upgrades in networks, data communications, and personal computer sales.  

In addition, Hungary’s privatized oil and gas company, Hungarian Oil and Gas Company (MOL), has requested USTDA assistance with the development and implementation of a new network system.    MOL owns and operates two conventional refineries and three specialty refineries.   MOL is one of Central Europe's largest integrated oil and gas companies, and is the largest company in Hungary in terms of sales.  MOL wishes to link their IT systems with those of other refineries in the region, which they have recently acquired.  A new IT system will help the company to better monitor the ebb and flow of oil and gas distribution, integrate tracking systems to better analyze energy demand, enhance overall efficiency, and maintain business and software solutions for customers.  

In addition, the DM consultant will examine a project to upgrade and rehabilitate Hungary’s electronic governmental tendering and purchasing system.  This is a priority project for the Ministry of IT and Telecom and would require substantial investment in software and hardware networks.  The Government of Hungary has held discussions with the U.S. company Ariba, which may approach USTDA for funding in the near future.   

While Poland recently experienced an economic slow-down, the Information Technology and Telecommunications sectors continue to perform better than average. The IT market in Poland has a total value of $3 billion while the telecommunications market is estimated at $9.4 billion. Information technology is currently at 2.1% of GDP, compared to an average of 3.8% in Europe and 2.3% in Central Europe.  Expenditures on these sectors are expected to grow as Poland becomes integrated into the European Union and the telecommunications sector continues to be liberalized.  

MPEC Wroclaw, a private Polish company, is the district heating service provider for Wroclaw, Poland.  Wroclaw, one of the top ten cities in Poland, has approximately one million inhabitants in its metro area and is a major industrial center.  MPEC Wroclaw has launched the Municipal Informatics Network project, a local broadband network covering much of Wroclaw.  MPEC Wroclaw has already upgraded its telecommunications systems, installing fiber optics along its district heating network.  Now it is connecting apartment buildings and other potential users of its broadband network to take advantage of the recently liberalized (from January 2003) market in voice telecommunications in Poland.  Already it has connected 7,000 apartments and hopes to connect at least 50,000.  MPEC Wroclaw has requested USTDA assistance for a feasibility study to recommend the most appropriate network architecture and integration of the network.

There are also government agencies in the sector with investment plans in Poland, including the Ministry of Finance, which is looking at IT procurement planning for over $100 million in IT services and equipment, and the Voivodship (province) of Kujawsko-Pomorski in northern Poland, which is considering the construction of a province-wide IT network. 

The DM consultant will travel to Poland and Hungary to assess the projects listed above according to USTDA criteria.  In addition to analyzing these projects, the DM consultant will look for other potential opportunities.  The consultant will spend approximately 10 business days in the region (five days in Poland and five days in Hungary).  In particular, the DM consultant will meet with MOL in Hungary, and MPEC Wroclaw, the Ministry of Finance and the Voivodship of Kujawsko-Pomorskie in Poland.  The DM consultant will work in close coordination with the Commercial Section of the U.S. Embassies in Warsaw and Budapest to help develop more project opportunities in the sector.  If the projects warrant USTDA consideration, the consultant will write terms of reference and budgets.  It is expected that the consultant will write terms of reference and budgets for at least two projects.

The AIBU is a major component of the F-16 C/D avionics systems. Radar, electronic warfare, navigation and communications depend upon the proper operation of the AIBU to coordinate signal emissions and receptions. If the AIBU should fail, the pilot could not operate the radar, electronic warfare, navigation, and communication systems at the same time.  The item is critical for ensuring reduced vulnerability to threats and increased survivability in a combat operational environment.

Although the F-16 Logistics Operation Division does not have an immediate requirement, this notification is for market research purposes to identify potential contractors who have the skills, experience, and knowledge required to successfully complete this effort for Hill AFB, Utah and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement will be accomplished.  This is not a request for proposal or invitation for bid.  

Interested parties may request a source qualification statement from Gary Grove, (801) 777-7202, gary.grove@hill.af.mil.  Request any engineering data in support of this synopsis by contacting OO-ALC/LGVED, Sheila Gunn.  The request can be emailed to Sheila.Gunn@hill.af.mil or faxed to (801)-777-9092.  This request for data should contain the synopsis number, a reference to "Sources Sought", a copy of the contractor's DD Form 2345 and a list of the drawings that are needed (the CAGE and/or NSN are also helpful).  Please respond by 30 days after posting date.

<CONTACT>Alice Sanders, Contract Specialist, Phone 210-536-3853, Fax 210-536-5836, Email alice.sanders@brooks.af.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI): The Deployable Oxygen System (DOS) IPT at the Human Systems Program Office, Brooks City Base, TX is in the process of seeking information from industry regarding development of a new family of gaseous oxygen generation systems to compliment the existing commercially available Deployable Oxygen System (DOS). The systems will be additions to the current DOS program.  This announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. 

BACKGROUND: The family of gaseous oxygen generation systems being considered for development would include a small (6-15 LPM), medium (60-180 LPM), and large (180-300 LPM) system.  There are two key performance parameters (KPPs) that these systems must meet.  The systems must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a medical device and the oxygen purity generated by the systems must be no less than 93 percent USP. These systems will be deployed to support an array of military operations throughout the world. The Air Force will initially focus efforts on the development of the medium sized (60-180 LPM) gaseous oxygen generation system. 

QUESTIONS TO INDUSTRY: A list of performance specifications, focus questions and a draft Statement of Objectives for the medium sized gaseous oxygen generation system are provided with this RFI.  Interested parties in the development of the medium sized oxygen generator must respond to focus questions via e-mail to both contacts listed below.  POCs listed below must receive your response/comments within fifteen (15) days of the publication of this announcement.  Firms responding should indicate whether they are small business, a small disadvantaged business, 8(a), or a large business. 

DoD CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR): Supplement (DFARS) have been amended to require contractor registration in the CCR database prior to the award of any contract, basic agreement, blanket ordering agreement or blanket purchasing agreement.  Having a CAGE Code alone is no longer sufficient to qualify a contractor to do business with DoD. (Parts 204, 212, and 252 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation.)  For CCR registration help or to find out the status of your registration call DLIS Customer Service 1-(888)-227-2423 or 269-961-4725 or go to the web site at www.ccr.gov.  Please have your DUNS number available if known.  Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) can be contacted at 1-866-705-5711.

Written responses should be addressed to 311 Human Systems Wing/YASK; ATTN: Ms. Alice Sanders, 7980 Lindbergh Landing, Brooks City-Base TX 78235-5119. For information please call Ms. Sanders at (210) 536-3853, Correct FAX Number is (210) 536-4535, email address provided herein.  No collect calls.

<DESC>Statement of Work
SPS-I Translator Development

Section 1 - Scope

This statement of work (SOW) is for software integration support for the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) Standard Procurement Joint Program Management Office (JPMO).  This support is for the creation and maintenance of a centralized Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which will facilitate the development of legacy system integrations with the Standard Procurement System.  

Section 2 - Background

The SPS JPMO is in the process of acquiring and fielding a commercially based standard application to support the automation of contracting offices throughout the Department of Defense (DoD).  This program will continue for several years and will include the use of modern technologies for software applications, adaptive technology, communications, security, data migration and data warehousing. 

Section 3 - Objectives

·	Establish an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) which is complementary to the existing AMS Integration Product Set (PD2 & webMethods PD2 Adapter) for building the interfaces ("translators") between PD2 and the SPS standard legacy systems.
·	Provide executable products (translators) which run completely independent of the development environment used for the IDE.
·	Capture all metadata about the "translators" in a repository owned and managed by the JPMO that provides:
o	Change Management capability (through impact analysis at the data element level)
o	Risk Mitigation and simplified maintenance (through automatically generated documentation)
o	Ability to distribute yet centrally-control development of additional translators/integrations by individual armed-services SMEs by providing a .NET development environment with no client footprint. 
o	Ability to plan future development of "translators" for Increment 3 and beyond.

Section 4 – Tasks 

Task 1 – Demonstrate Proof of Concept (Development of USMC & USN Translators)

Contractor will demonstrate a proof of concept by accomplishing the following subtasks:

Subtask 1:  Develop USMC SABRS/CAPSW Translator using PD2 Adapter v. 1.9.1.  Conduct impact analysis on Adapter upgrade to v. 1.9.2.  Regenerate USMC SABRS/CAPSW Translator based on results of impact analysis.  

Subtask 2:  Develop USN Translators for the following legacy system integrations:  SYMIS, STARS, UADPS, 511, and UICP.

Subtask 3:  Integration of ETI Generated code with webMethods development/delivery environment – to provide a seamless deployable product to the JPMO.

Successful execution of this task will be demonstrated by contractor’s ability to:

·	Transform XML files produced by the PD2 adapter into specified User Defined Format (UDF) files.·	Transform specified UDF files into XML consumable by the PD2 adapter.·	Successfully deploy translators into an operational webMethods environment	Success will be demonstrated via system integration testing conducted by the JPMO Government Test Facility (GTF)
·	Favorably demonstrate development efficiencies gained by use of the ETI tools·	Favorably demonstrate documentation capabilities of the ETI tools (in both speed and completeness)·	Favorably demonstrate ability of impact analysis capabilities of the ETI tools	Success will be judged by JPMO review of 1) feedback obtained from Subject Matter Experts involved in development process both with and without ETI toolset, and 2) documentation generated by the ETI product and comparison to similar documentation produced for the SPS-I systems being replaced.


	
Successful completion of Task 1 is essential prior to the accomplishment of any further tasks.  All follow-on tasks are optional

OPTION - Task 2 – Development of USA Translators

Contractor will provide necessary services for the development, test and implementation of the following US Army Translators:  CAPS, CEFMS, FPDS, AIRS, AMCISS, TAMMIS, DARTS, RMS & SAMMS

<SUBJECT>R -- Notice of Intent to Increase Ceiling on Contract For Executive Protective Services
<DESC>The Department of State, Office of Acquisitions, intends to award a sole source modification to increase the ceiling on contract S-LMAQM-00-D-0027 awarded to DynCorp International under full and open competition.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with the incumbent contractor under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 for executive protection services.  The job positions require extensive pre-deployment training and historical knowledge of the operating location/procedures.  The ceiling will be increased from $82.26M to approximately $118M in order to continue current operations within the scope of the statement of work.  A sudden increase in worldwide security requirements caused the original ceiling to become inadequate.  The government anticipates a full and open solicitation for these requirements to be issued in the April - May timeframe.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest in this action by email to the Contracting Officer, Raymond Bouford, at BoufordRW@state.gov by 4PM on February 20, 2004.  No telephone calls will be returned due to workload.

<SUBJECT>A -- Ultra-Short Pulse Lasers as Next Generation Hyperspectral Radiography Sources
<DESC>Ultra-Short Pulse Lasers as Next-Generation Hyperspectral Radiography Sources SN04-13.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring a workshop discussing how to use femtosecond lasers as next-generation radiography sources. The workshop will be held March 30-31, 2004, at the Executive Conference Center in Arlington, Virginia.  The workshop is intended to facilitate formation of multi-disciplinary research teams that can devise radiographic or tomographic methods that utilize bench top ultra-short pulse lasers (<100 femtoseconds [fs or 1„e10-15 s], referred to as UPLs) with peak pulse powers nearing a petawatt (1 PW, or 1„e1015 W) and intensities greater than 1„e1018 W/cm2.  In support of this goal, the workshop should serve as a forum for the research and application communities to learn about state-of-the-art needs and capabilities of the other. Recent experiments have shown that at these power and intensity levels, nonlinear processes within target materials create secondary photons with a broad range of frequencies (light has been produced from below 1„e1012 [100 ƒÝm] to above 1„e1018 Hz [0.1 nm]) and high brightness.  Additional experiments have also shown that these lasers can be used to produce MeV-class charged particle beams (electrons, protons, and positrons) with good beam divergence and high brightness.  Further, interactions with deuterated materials have been shown to produce neutrons with reasonable flux levels.  All of these processes promise excellent spatial resolution when utilized as a radiation source for radiographic imaging or tomography.  It is envisioned that such a flexible radiation source would be an extremely valuable tool for the two application areas listed below.  On the first day of the workshop, the scientific and technical advancements necessary to realize the envisioned laser-based imaging system will be examined, including at a minimum: 1) investigation of optimal radiation and particle beam production techniques,  2) laser development conducive to the repeatable production of radiation of known frequency, bandwidth, and intensity (or particle beams of known energy, flux, and brightness),  3) optics and beam control automation to deliver the radiation or particle beam to a specified location,  4) adaptation of existing radiographic (imaging and tomographic) techniques to UPL-based radiation and particle-beam sources,  5) evaluation of multi-spectral imaging and tomography opportunities made possible by the broad range of secondary photon wavelengths produced by the UPL,  6)  novel imaging and tomography techniques or the combination of multiple existing techniques,  7)  automated algorithms to identify and extract relevant signals from produced images or tomographs,  and 8)  detector technology to support the above.  The above issues are meant to be representative, not prescriptive; participants are encouraged to suggest appropriate issues beyond those listed. The second day of the workshop will examine the utility of such an imaging system towards two particular application areas: 1) non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of material damage, and 2) medical diagnostics and therapeutics.  In the first case, discussion topics should include: identification of specific NDE problems where UPL-based systems would have high probability of improved utility, multi-spectral measurement techniques, and technical challenges needed to bring this concept to utility.  Discussion topics in the medical diagnostics and therapeutics section will include: identification of unique medical opportunities presented by UPL-based radiation sources (such as combined imaging and radiotherapy sources); economic and support requirements for radiation sources unique to the medical field; and technical requirements for medical applications. It is envisioned that this project will combine the expertise of physicists, material scientists, signal processing and control mathematicians, electronic, optical, and system engineers, and both clinical and research medical personnel. These scientists will be drawn from industry, academia and national laboratories. The event website is http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/Index.asp?meetingid=214.  The workshop registration fee is $110.00 and includes all workshop activities including a continental breakfast and working lunch.  Registration cutoff is March 3, 2004, or at attendance capacity, whichever comes first.  Space is very limited and it is recommended that you register early.  For further administrative information, contact Lisa Roberson, (lroberson@snap.org) Subject:  Ultra-Short Pulse Lasers as Next-Generation Hyperspectral Radiography Sources).  Please refer to the Workshop in all correspondence.  This announcement is NOT a request for proposals. No solicitation document is available at this time.
