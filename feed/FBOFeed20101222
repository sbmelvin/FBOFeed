<CONTACT>Jamie Leonard jamie.leonard@hanscom.af.mil

<a href="mailto:jamie.leonard@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>Synopsis:  Notice of Contract Action (NOCA) - This announcement constitutes notice of intent that the C2ISR Directorate (HS) Operational C2 Division, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom AFB, intends to award a "bridge" contract to The AEgis Technologies Group, Inc., 410 Jan Davis Drive NW, Huntsville, AL 35806-2801, for software integration, development, and maintenance support for the Air Force Modeling and Simulation Training Toolkit (AFMSTT) program at JLVC 5.0 Integration Events 1 and 2, and Yama Sakura exercise.  The estimated value of this action is below $200K. The AEgis Technologies Group, Inc. is being awarded this sole source "bridge" contracting action to ensure contractor support will be provided to three near-term events employing the AFMSTT system.  This "bridge" contract was deemed necessary by the contracting officer, where fiscal law considerations require migration of the primary and secondary O&M and secondary RDT&E requirements under the recently awarded AFMSTT contract (FA8731-10-C-0003; awarded 28 Apr 10) to a new indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract.  The requirements that will necessitate a modification of the AFMSTT contract to an IDIQ contract came to light recently.  This will occur after the requirement covered by the bridge contract have been formalized. The period of performance for this bridge contract will be from 05 January 2011 through 08 April 2011.This contract action will include AFMSTT support to the JLVC 5.0 Integration Events 1 and 2, and the Yama Sakura command post exercise.  JLVC 5.0 IEs 1 and 2 will directly support the JLVC 5.0 development baseline, which will be used to support future major exercises that include Austere Challenge, Terminal Fury, and Talisman Sabre.  These events will be the first exposure of AFMSTT v5.0 into this development baseline making up-front integration events critical for future success.  Contractor support activities include maintaining Joint National Training Capabilities (JNTC), integration of Federation requirements, support JNTC Model Verification, Validation and Accreditation (VV&A) efforts, and provide subject matter expert inputs via Model/Federation meetings.  These tasks fall under the contract's primary and secondary O&M requirements.The Yama Sakura exercise is an annual, bilateral command post exercise that simulates Japanese - U.S. military operations required to defend Japan.  Yama Sakura exercises have had four mission objectives:  To train U.S. ground forces for deployment to Japan; provide Japan Self Defense Force (JSDF) maximum exposure to U.S. warfighting doctrine; exercise JSDF capabilities to defend Japan; and prepare U.S. Army Japan 9th Theater Army Area Command (TAACOM) for its wartime mission.  It is Army I Corps' largest and most important exercise in Japan.  These tasks fall under the contract's secondary O&M requirements.This NOCA does not constitute a Request for Proposal, it does not restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach, and it should not be construed as a commitment by the Government.  This action is authorized under 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1(2)(iii)(B), which states that for DOD, NASA, and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that an award to any other source would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements.  The Government intends to make an award before 05 January 2011.  No technical data/drawings/Technical Orders are available.  No later than fifteen (15) calendar days after synopsis posting date, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency! .  Those interested firms must indicate whether they are large, small, small-disadvantaged, 8(a) or women owned business, and whether they are U.S. or foreign owned.

<DESC>The requirement is for the replacement of seven existing cooling towers at the NIST Steam and Chilled Water Generation Plant with eight new counter-flow towers and a total of 23,000 Tons cooling capacity. The new towers will feature state-of-the-art variable speed drives for fan units, efficient evaporative cooling cycles and fire-rated tower structures made of FRP products which will never rust or degrade from the harsh weather conditions. The design is planned such that work can be performed over the winter months while keeping the facility capacity for chilled water generation at 9,000 Tons. The project expands the existing concrete basin and effectively utilizes existing pumps, piping and electrical services during the integration of all new systems. New towers are factory manufactured then assembled in the field by qualified vendors meeting the specifications for field erected towers. Plans require specific phased construction sequencing to continue 100% operations of the chiller plant with critical milestones that must be attained before demolition of the existing towers and erection of the new tower systems.<br /><br />THIS PROCUREMENT IS 100% SET ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. The standard classification NAICS code is 236220 -- Commercial and Institutional Building Construction. With a small business size standard of $33.5 million. <br /><br />The anticipated period of performance is 542 Calendar Days for two distinct construction phases of the new towers that will prohibit construction during the summer season of 2011. Detailed specifications and drawings will be issued with the solicitation. The magnitude of construction for the entire project is between $5M and $10M.

<DESC>NAVAIR NAWCAD Lakehurst intends to enter into a sole source contract with Pall Aeropower Corporation for two (2) each Backup Brake Control Module(s) (for V-22 Aircraft), Part Number V10000A011. The Back Up Brake Control Module (BUBCM) provides pressure from the accumulator to the four master brake cylinders in the absence of utility system pressure. When required, it can also supply charge pressure to the accumulator from the aircraft's motor pump. The major components consist of pilot-operated solenoid valves, the accumulator isolation valve, the motor pump isolation valve, the system relief valve, brake and pump filter assemblies, a pressure transducer and a pressure switch. This acquisition is for the procurement of (2) Depot Units Under Test (UUT's) which are required to develop software routines and organic testing capabilities using the V-22 Hydraulic Automated Test System (VHATS) Hydraulic Actuator Test Stand. VHATS enables the depot to test and isolate component faults, repair, and retest existing V-22 BUBCMs within the Fleet to ensure proper functioning. Use of these UUT's to develop VHATS software routines also facilitates V-22 Depot-level organic repair capability as mandated by U.S. Title 10 USC Subsection 24-64. These BUBCMs have been developed and are currently in use within the V-22 fleet. This acquisition is in support of the V-22 aircraft maintenance program.
<p>Pall Aeropower Corp is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the Backup Brake Control Modules, and these exact components are needed as UUTs to develop VHATS software routines for fault testing. Products that are not the exact same components cannot be used or else development of these procedures would be compromised.</p>
<p>The Government intends to procure this equipment under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (c) (1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 6.302-1. (THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.) All responsible sources are encouraged to submit information, which may be used by the Government in determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<a href="mailto:Fuchs.Samantha@epamail.epa.gov">Fuchs.Samantha@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Office Acquisition Management (OAM) Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1)), GIFT Solutions, LLC, Pittsford, NY.  The applicable NAICS code is 541614.
The Transportation and Climate Division (TCD) of the U.S. EPA is responsible for understanding and analyzing current greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and energy consumption trends, in the U.S. transportation sector. Under the authority of the Clean Air Act, EPA has begun its rulemaking process to regulate emissions of GSGs from medium and heavy-duty vehicles (M/HDV).  One possible source of emissions reductions is through fuel economy improvements for M/HDVs and, this issue has been the focus of recent technology and economic studies conducted by government, industry, and non-profit organizations.  
There are a number of complicating factors associated with regulating M/HDVs, many of which were described in a 2010 National Academies of Science study entitled Technologies and Approaches to Reducing the Fuel Consumption of Medium ? and Heavy?Duty Vehicles. One important factor to consider is the system-wide fleet and operational impacts associated with rules that on the one hand may increase the capital costs of vehicles, but on the other reduce operating costs through fuel savings.  In the former case and increase in vehicle capital costs may create ?pre-buy? incentives, or may cause delays in fleet turnover, thereby diminishing the effectiveness of new standards.  In the latter case, reduction in fuel use (and therefore operating costs), may create a ?rebound effect? that leads to greater vehicle miles traveled, and again diminish the standard?s effectiveness.  This project will focus on this ?rebound effect.?
As mentioned in the NAS Study, there is a dearth of information in the literature about the scale of the rebound effect (elasticity estimates) for HDVs.  In particular, the NAS found the following: 
?Finding 6-11.  Elasticity estimates vary over a wide range, and it is not possible to calculate with a great deal of confidence what the magnitude of the ?rebound? effect is for heavy-duty trucks.  The rebound effect measures the increase in ton-miles shipped resulting from a reducing in the cost of shipping.  Estimates of fuel savings from regulatory standards will be somewhat misestimated if the ?Rebound? effect is not considered.?
The NAS study did identify several studies that attempted to quantify the HDV rebound effect, but it did not go into detail on these, nor did it critically evaluate all the potential literature on this topic.  
This procurement requires the services of a contractor that possess the unique capability for analyzing the potential magnitude of the M/HDV rebound effect.  The M/HDV rebound effect has not been well studied in the past, and very little modeling work has been done in this area to explicitly capture how the rebound effect could affect intermodal shifting.  As the lead author of Indirect Effects and Externalities section of the recent National Academy of Sciences report on M/HD vehicles (which included the discussion on the rebound effect), James Winebrake and his associates at GIFT Solutions, LLC are uniquely qualified to provide this analysis to EPA.  In addition, the Geospatial Intermodal Freight Transportation (GIFT) model, developed and maintained by GIFT Solutions, LLC, is the only known model that will allow TCD to explicitly analyze intermodal freight transportation.     One of the main objectives of this project is to provide EPA a comprehensive review and critique of the literature related to the rebound effect for HDVs.  
A second major objective is to apply modeling tools, such as Geospatial Intermodal Freight Transportation (GIFT) model and/or other analytical tools to explore the economic impacts associated with fuel consumption reductions of freight transportation in the U.S. (the GIFT model is a unique, analytical tool that allows for the modeling of intermodal freight transportation.  Operated in an ArcGIS environment, GIFT links highway, railway, and waterway networks into an integrated intermodal network via connectivity at ports, railyards, and other freight transfer facilities.  GIFT allows users to apply network attributes [such as costs, speed, emission, or energy use] to network segments and nodes in order to conduct network optimization analysis through shortest-path algorithms.  These analyses can be done for single origin-destination pair analysis or for sets of origin-destination pairs such that freight systems can be evaluated.  The GIFT model has been discussed in literature  and is currently the only such model designed for these types of analyses.) Such modeling could uncover the impact of fuel cost savings on operational costs and freight rates, which may then be used to evaluate potential VMT increases.
Work is to consist of the following:Literature review and background search to obtain information related to the ?rebound effect? in the HDV freight sector.  The Literature Reviews will include articles and reports in the academic and non-academic literature.  The Goal of this review will be to identify, summarize, and critique any studies that we uncover.  This review will be conducted for ?Rebound effects? that include both modal substitution effects (E.G., the role of lower cost truck transportation on rail-to-truck and ship-to-truck mode shifts) and demand effects (e.g., the role of lower cost truck transportation on increased ton-miles of truck freight movements.)  
The contractor will produce intermediate and final version of a Power Point presentation that highlights key aspects of the literature review.  In addition, intermediate and final versions of a literature review report will be submitted in a format that may allow for potential publication in an academic journal.  
Perform one to five case study evaluations aimed at exploring the operational cost impacts of fuel economy improvements in a HDV and the potential impact these cost savings could have on freight rates.  The focus of the case studies will be Class 8 vehicle, as these vehicles consume approximately 80% of the energy in the M/HDV freight sector.  Case studies may include modeling the operational costs of a trip from an origin to a destination under pre-regulatory conditions, and comparing these costs with post-regulatory conditions (assuming certain fuel economy improvements).  
Results could then be used in the GIFT model or other tools to illustrate how these reduced operational costs to HDV operators could lead to mod-shifting (E.G. from rail to truck) or operational behavior changes (Such as re-routing) that lead to VMT increase.  
The contractor will produce intermediate and final versions of a Power Point presentation that highlights key aspects of this analysis.  In addition, intermediate and final versions of a report will be submitted in a format that may allow for potential publication in an academic journal listing and briefly describing the assumptions and model modifications.  
This is not a request for proposal. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice. 
A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The applicable NAICS code is 541614. Please submit your request in writing to: US EPA, Samantha Fuchs at 26 W.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:<br />The United States Government currently leases approximately 7,878 RSF of warehouse and related space. The Government will relocate if consideration of the economics involved and other factors prove favorable. The cost of moving, replication, and impact on agency mission, among other things, will be considered in the relocation decision. Offered space must be contiguous and provide ABAAS-compliant entrances and restrooms. Offered space must provide two (2) four-foot-high loading docks, a minimum clear ceiling height of 18 feet, and minimum floor load of 250 pounds per RSF. On site parking must be available for Government use at no additional cost in accordance with local code, or in the absence of a local code at a rate of one space per 1,000 RSF of leased space. Occupancy is required no later than May 1, 2012.
<p>Offerors should note that in its price evaluation, the Government will consider the total value of existing improvements, equipment, and fixtures (whether lessor or Government owned) that are included in each offeror's proposal to meet the tenant agency's requirements. The value of any improvements, equipment, and fixtures that meet the Government's requirements in excess of the Government's standard building shell requirements will be considered in the price evaluation in order to reduce the overall cost to the Government to build out and occupy any space. In addition to those costs the Government will also consider physical move costs, the impact on the agency mission, and the costs associated with non-productive agency downtime, etc.</p>
<p>LEASE TERM:<br />The lease term will be a firm term of five (5) years.</p>

CONTRACT INFORMATION<BR>This contract is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6.  It is anticipated that (1) firm fixed price "C" contract will be awarded for design services required for the construction of a Medical Countermeasure Test & Evaluation Facility located on the National Interagency Biodefense Campus at Fort Detrick, Maryland. The estimated construction cost of this project is in the range of $400 million to $800 million. The contract will be negotiated as a fixed fee with a base scope of work and options as deemed necessary and may include fast-track design packages under Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) procedures. Selection of A-E firms is based upon the professional qualifications necessary for performance of the required services. A-E services are required for site investigation, planning, programming, survey and geotech report (option), engineering studies including permit application, schematic design (charrette), concept design, final design, commissioning (option), and construction phase services (option) for the subject project.   Construction phase services will include laboratory/vivarium bio-containment commissioning, preparation of operation and maintenance manuals, and shop drawing review and approval.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this action is 541330. The Product Service Code (PSC) is C118, Research and Development Facilities. This is an unrestricted acquisition and is open to all businesses regardless of size. A firm fixed price A-E contract will be negotiated with a 7-year period of performance; to include approximately two (2) years for design deliverables and five (5) years for the construction phase services. The contract is anticipated to be awarded by June 2011.  If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on that part of the work it plans to subcontract.  The plan is not required with this submittal.   <BR><BR>SUBCONTRACTING PLAN REQUIREMENTS:   In accordance with FAR 19.702(a)(1), a subcontracting plan is required if the firm is a large business.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) anticipates the competitive award of a requirements contract to provide a centrally-managed source of Workers Compensation Insurance as required by the statutorily mandated Defense Base Act (DBA) Program.  The requirements contract will cover all OCONUS USACE, CENTCOM Contracting Command and 408th Contract Support Brigade contracts.  It is anticipated that the contractor/insurance carrier will receive a single delivery order under the resultant requirements contract for total execution and management of the program, by working directly with the USACE Contractors requiring DBA Insurance for work performed outside the Continental United States (with the exception of Hawaii and Alaska) unless a waiver has been obtained by the U.S. Department of Labor.  USACE will establish the option year rates for services, construction, security and aviation based on data received from the contractor that clearly reflects the cumulative loss history.  The successful offeror shall deal directly with the companies requiring DBA Insurance for payment arrangements and resolution of issues.  No Government funds will be allocated under any agreement or contract governing the administration of this program.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the Federal Business Opportunities Website for current status of solicitations and amendments.  Hard copies of the solicitation document will not be available.  All offerors will be ineligible for award unless they have registered in the DoD Central Contract Registration database at www.ccr.gov.

<a href="mailto:paul.c.daugherty@usace.army.mil">USACE HNC, Huntsville</a>
<DESC><BR>   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Chemical-Demilitarization Directorate intends to award a performance-based contract to assist the Ministry of Industry and Trade (Minpromtorg) of the Russian Federation (RF) by providing  continued technical assistance in the systemization, operations, and maintenance (O&M) of the Shchuch'ye Chemical Weapons Destruction Facility (Shchuch'ye CWDF) and to provide the same or similar type support to the facility located in Kizner, Russia.  The Kizner CWDF facility will present the same or similar requirement as the Shchuch'ye facility in the number and type of munitions to be destroyed.  It is anticipated that the destruction of approximately two million chemical weapons at the Kizner CWDF will begin in May 2011.  This continuation of support effort at the Shchuch'ye CWDF is funded through the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) under an agreement dated June 17, 1992, between the United States and Russia Federation for the Safe and Secure Transportation, Storage and Destruction of Weapons and Prevention of Weapons Proliferation (Umbrella Agreement).  The purpose of this acquisition is to provide a full-time on-site staff to provide technical assistance during the systemization and operational phases of the facility in an effort to maintain full operation capability.  The effort will include assistance with systemization of installed equipment, technical support services, limited procurement of equipment and spare parts and installation services, verification of work performed at the site, and logistics and administrative support for U.S. program management personnel.     <BR><BR>This acquisition is for continued U.S. technical assistance to the Russian Federation in support of efforts to destroy chemical munitions.  The original objective of the Chemical Weapons Elimination program was to assist the Russian Federation (RF) in establishing a chemical weapons destruction facility (CWDF) near Shchuch'ye, Russia for the purpose of destroying chemical filled munitions in a safe, secure, and environmentally sound manner.  Shchuch'ye was the specific location named by the Russian Federation when they requested assistance from the United States in the establishment of a chemical agent destruction facility and the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Policy guidance supported the request.  The assistance provided included integrating and systemizing the processing and associated support equipment and facilities, and commissioning of the facilities as an acceptable industrial complex under RF standards and laws.  As construction of the complex neared completion in 2009, the Russian Federation requested continued U.S. technical assistance to monitor and evaluate facilities and equipment maintenance through the remaining agent elimination efforts as a means of assuring continued full functionality of the systems and equipment.  These services are classified under North American Industry Classification System NAICS code 541990, "All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services", with a small business size standard of $7 M.  The expected contract capacity will be $48.8 Million. The Government will issue the RFP on/about 06 January 2011 for full and open competition. <BR>

<a href="mailto:yesenia.rodriguez1@amedd.army.mil">Center for Health Care Contracting</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Health Care Acquisition Activity (HCAA), Center for Health Care Contracting (CHCC), Fort Sam Houston, Texas intends to award a cost reimbursement contract on a sole source basis to the American Registry of Pathology (ARP), 14th Alaska Ave. NW, Washington, DC  20306-0001.  The requirement is for non-personal forensic pathology and support services for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner System (AFMES) in support of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).  The AFMES is comprised of five integrated divisions, whose overall mission is to determine clinically and scientifically the cause of death of US service members, and in certain situations US service member dependents, federal government officials, and civilians not otherwise affiliated with the DoD worldwide.  The Contractor will support this mission by providing qualified personnel, services, materials, equipment, supplies, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government, necessary to perform professional scientific, administrative and logistical support.  The Contractor will also be required to transition, using a three (3) phase move plan, during the relocation of AFMES operations from Rockville, MD to Dover AFB, DE.  Phased movements will require dual operations for a minimum of 12 months and the Contractor will be required to provide a Continuity Team resourced with technical, administrative, logistical, and bioinformatics support.  The purpose of dual operations is to ensure accreditation standards are maintained, while continuing to operate fully functional laboratories, in both locations.  This may include required daily travel between both locations and/or work in either primary office during the transition.  This support will primarily be responsible for maintaining mission support operations as AFIP executes the base realignment and closure (BRAC) transition plan. Travel is required for mission support, meetings, industry conferences and seminars, professional developmental training, court cases, and laboratory inspections.  The basis for sole source justification is that ARP is the only contractor identified that can start performance on April 1, 2011, with fully certified personnel and provide full mission support without degradation.  It would take a minimum of 6 to 12 months lead/transition time to bring a new contractor online since personnel must not only be qualified, but must be certified on each procedure within the laboratory before being cleared to work.  It is these multiple certifications that take 6 to 12 months to acquire.   As the current contractor, ARP's personnel are already fully certified on all equipment and procedures and are the only responsible source identified that can perform the core mission.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 621111.  The CHCC intends to award a 6-month bridge contract, with a 6-month option period to provide these forensic pathology and support services no later than January 21, 2011.  The anticipated base period of performance is April 1, 2011 through September 30, 2011.  This is a sole source award.  The CHCC intends to solicit and negotiate only with the American Registry of Pathology under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A solicitation will not be published.  However, any quotes, proposals, or capability statements received by close of business on Monday, January 10, 2011, will be considered by the contracting officer.  The CHCC reserves the right to amend this notice if needed.  The Contracting Officer is Mr. Jeffery Croley, (210) 221-3349, email jeffery.croley@amedd.army.mil.  The Contract Specialist is Ms. Yesenia C. Rodriguez, (210) 221-5963, email yesenia.rodriguez1@amedd.army.mil.

<DESC>This sources sought synopsis is being issued for the sole purpose of market research. This synopsis does not obligate the government to issue a solicitation or contract though it is the expectation of the government to do so. Vendors that submit information will not receive any special preference during selection.
<p>The Forest Service is contemplating awarding a service (operations and maintenance) contract to fuel and maintain a wood fired boiler at the Southeast Alaska Discovery Center (SEADC) at 50 Main Street, Ketchikan AK 99901. The footprint of the SEADC building is about 21,000 square feet.<br /><br />The proposed contract will cover operations and maintenance of the wood fired boiler, and supply and delivery of wood chips or pellets. Operations will involve, but not be limited to, periodic cleaning and ash removal. Maintenance will include all preventative maintenance recommended or required by the manufacturer. Wood chips or pellet supply will have to meet specific criteria including water content, chip size, and ash content.</p>
<p>The estimated magnitude of the project is between $25,000 and $100,000 per annum. Accordingly, the Government anticipates making the solicitation a Total Small Business set-aside if two or more small businesses are capable of meeting the requirement at a reasonable price.&nbsp; The wood fired boiler is rated to 750 MBH. Annual supply of chips or pellets is expected to be approximately 125 tons/year, or 500 cubic yards per year but will depend on weather. The onsite feed hopper capacity is approximately 75 cubic yards. Off street space for offloading chips is not available. The contractor will be required to coordinate with the City/Borough of Ketchikan for any required permits, and know and abide by all applicable federal, state and local ordinances/regulations.</p>
<p>The Forest Service is asking businesses interested in this project to submit a brief response letter. This response shall be submitted as an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) or MS word (.doc or .docx) attachment in an e-mail to James Kase (jdkase@fs.fed.us), with a cc: to Kent Bowers (kbowers@fs.fed.us) by close of business on Friday, January 21, 2011. The response, and any accompanying correspondence, should be brief, and should not exceed 1MB in size. It should be written with the intent of helping the Forest Service write the description of the service so that the required services can be obtained at a reasonable price, while ensuring that potential local suppliers stay competitive.</p>
<p>The response should address the following topics:<br />1) Wood pellets are not currently available from an all-Alaskan source. How can this contract best provide incentive to a company to manufacture and supply wood pellets from, and in, Alaska? <br />2) The base period of contractual obligation can be between 1 and 3 years, with additional option years. What length of contractual obligation minimizes risk, and optimizes the attractiveness of bidding on the contract?<br />3) Payment for wood chips can be based on BTUs delivered, weight, or volume. A significant factor in the energy stored in the chips is water content. What payment method is fair to both the supplier and the Forest Service, and provides incentive to the supplier to deliver dry chips?<br />4) The absolute maximum allowable water content for the wood chip or pellet is 55%; 30% or less water content is preferred, and may result in reduced operations and maintenance. Any handling of chips to meet the moisture requirement must be done off site. Is it possible to deliver the quantity of dried chips needed? <br />5) Wood chips or pellets will need to be delivered into the top of a 10 foot tall hopper enclosed with a roof, 4 walls, and some sort of door. Potentially, a government furnished auger, conveyor belt or air pump would be available to load the chips. The alternative would be for the contractor to load the hopper by hand, or by using contractor-owned equipment. Which alternative is most attractive, and how will it affect the price?<br />6) What is the firm's experience in similar contracts?<br />7) What are the firm's name, address, DUNS number, and point of contact information?<br />8) What is the firm's size status, such as small business, small disadvantaged business, HUBZone small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, or 8(a) contractor?<br />9) How do you intend to provide the required quantity of wood chips or pellets and do you have more than one capable source?</p>
<p>The Forest Service is not scheduling a pre-solicitation conference at this time. We hope all interested parties will share helpful information in the format requested above.</p>

<DESC>SMALL BUSINESS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE
<p><br />Notice Number: HHS-NIH-NCI-SBSS-TSB-17001-02</p>
<p>Title: "Data Management for Cancer Diagnosis Program Activities"</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>This National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) project is for the renewal of contract HHSN261200422007C, N02-CM-42207 with Information Management Services, Inc. (IMS) that was awarded on a competitive basis for a five year period. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests regarding the current contract with IMS Incorporated should be directed to Suzy Milliard at milliars@mail.nih.gov. This Small Business Sources Sought Notice (SBSS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement as a set-aside based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Interested parties are expected to review this Notice, the draft Technical Evaluation Criteria and the draft Statement of Work to familiarize themselves with the requirements of this project; failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The role of the Cancer Diagnosis Program (CDP) is to facilitate transfer of concepts and technological developments from basic research into clinical applications for improved diagnosis and prognosis. Activities have included support for: specimen resources; marker studies in several organ systems; a molecular profiling study of lung cancer; and studies to evaluate the performance of clinical assays for 18qLOH in colon cancer and BCR-ABL in CML. The establishment and maintenance of secure websites has also become a significant portion of this effort.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives:</p>
<p>The purpose of this Small Business Sources Sought Notice is to identify qualified small business concerns including HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses that are interested in and capable of performing the work described herein. The NCI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses received nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted.</p>
<p>As a result of this SBSS Notice, the NCI may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NCI shall arise as a result of a response to this Small Business Sources Sought Notice or the NCI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p><br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is an institute within the National Institutes of Health (NIH), one of eight agencies that compose the Public Health Service (PHS), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The mission of the NCI is to plan, conduct, and coordinate the National Cancer Program and involves (a) research on the causes, detection, diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and palliative care of cancers and on rehabilitation of the cancer patient and (b) demonstration of the effectiveness of cancer control methods and techniques.</p>
<p>Project Requirements:</p>
<p>1. COORDINATION OF ACTIVITIES IN SUPPORT OF THE COOPERATIVE GROUP BANKS - The Cooperative Group Banks (CGB) resource is a national conglomerate of biorepositories operated by the NCI Clinical Cooperative Oncology Groups that collect, store and distribute a variety of specimens including blood, urine, buccal swabs, bone marrow, frozen tissues and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. The specimens and associated clinical data are collected in the context of phase II and III NCI-supported clinical trials conducted by the Cooperative Groups. The Contractor shall support coordination of activities of the Group Banking Committee (GBC=Steering Committee of the CGB resource) and 5 GBC Subcommittees.</p>
<p>2.

<a href="mailto:EC_helpdesk@NBC.GOV">Point of Contact above, or if none listed, contact the IDEAS EC HELP DESK for assistance</a>
<DESC>Sources Sought/Brand Name or EqualThis is a request for information (RFI). This is not a request for proposal or quotation.  The National Park Service (NPS) requests information and recommendations from respondents concerning the product description below. 
Responses to this sources sought announcement will be used by the Government to make the appropriate acquisition decisions. The purpose of this RFI is to identify potential equal products to the brand name product noted.  
NPS has periodic requirements for revegetation services.  These services are provided for via Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts.  Specific projects and requirements are described and awarded via individual task order.  Individual task orders may include hydroseeding /seeding requirements.  Soil amendments may be needed to meet seeding requirements to ensure proper seed germination and survival of seedlings. NPS uses the soil amendments as a surface application on recently replaced salvaged top soils either just before seeding or incorporated in the hydroseeding slurry.  NPS prefers to use an organic soil amendment/fertilizer.NPS develops a scope for work for individual task orders and will specify requirement for a soil amendment/fertilizer, if needed.  
It is requested that vendors/respondents to this sources sought provide alternative organic products to the following brand name or equal soil amendment: "Biosol"
Specifications (as per manufacturers label): 97% natural organic and 3% potassium-magnesia. It is not derived from or contain animal waste or by-products or composted municipal waste. It provides slow release of organically bound nitrogen. 
Nutrient ratio:  NPK= 6?1?3. "	Organic substance		>70%"	Nitrogen (total)		>6%"	Nitrogen (water soluable)	<0.5%"	Phosphorus (P2O2)		1-2%"	Soluble Potash (K2O)	3-4%"	Carbon/Nitrogen Ration	6:1"	pH level			5-6
Heavy Metal contents in mg/kg of DS (dry substance)"	Copper (Cu)		<50 ppm"	Chromium (Cr)		50 ppm"	Lead (Pb)			50 ppm"	Cadmium (Cd)		1 ppm"	Zinc (Zn)			0.100 ppm
(All metal content is within the tolerance limits for animal feed.)
Usage/application Note:  Most of the areas NPS requires work are very nutrient poor soils and most of the species that NPS installs do not require nutrient rich soils and, in fact, will do poorly in high nitrogen soils.  The nutrient content of the soil amendment is low compared to many other fertilizers and mimics nutrient levels in undisturbed soils more closely than other higher nutrient content soil amendments and fertilizers.  Additionally, nitrogen contained in Biosol is released more slowly than other fertilizers allowing plants a more extended period of having available nitrogen rather than the nitrogen quickly flushing through the system.  Any proposed equal will need to address this note.
Respondents are requested to submit the following in writing:1.	Availability of equal product to the salient characteristics and application noted in this announcement2.	Summary of product specifications, demonstrated capabilities, product past performance and application, and comparability to item listed3.	Your firm's name, address, point of contact (with phone number, email, and fax).4.	Your firms size standard (i.e. large, small business)5.	A brief abstract of about the company
Responses and comments will be shared with the Government project team, but otherwise will be held in strict confidence. Phone inquiries will not be taken at this time.  Respondents are encouraged to submit information via email to Tom Locke at Tom_Locke@nps.gov with the Subject line: "Revegetation soil amendment" no later than 3p (MT) on January 21, 2011.

<DESC>: In accordance with FAR 5.205, PEO Submarines is seeking sources that can potentially provide technologies applicable for incorporation into the Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System (SWFTS) and associated Technology Insertion (TI) efforts under sponsorship of Program Executive Officer Submarines (PMS425). 

The overall end state objective of this SWFTS effort  is to provide improved command decision making performance and reduce the time and cost associated with upgrades to the submarine combat systems elements and attack center.  SWFTS subsystems typically encompass the following command level functions: mission planning and rehearsal; contact detection, classification and tracking; multi sensor contact management; command team decision making;  post mission reporting;  safe maneuvering of the submarine platform; and effective employment of submarine payloads.

The goal of this sources sought is to identify emerging, new, or modifiable hardware and/or software technologies and concepts that are potentially applicable for near and long term future submarine Command And Control Center (CACC) designs through FY20.
  These technologies may include advanced display devices, human computer interaction techniques and computer processing that show promise to improve the command decision team interaction with the systems and also potentially reduce the size, weight, power and cooling demands that the system places on the platform.  The focus is to identify advanced research and development concepts that are sufficiently mature so that they may be assessed with respect to their ability to meet program objectives. 

Interested vendors shall submit a five-page (maximum) white paper in response to this announcement that describes their technology as it relates to the key functional areas of submarine command and control attack center operations.
  Descriptions should include identification of key technologies or algorithms, current state of maturity, results achieved to date and project sponsorship.  

Inquiries, questions and submissions shall be directed to Maria Gregory via email at maria.gregory@navy.mil.  Responses are due no later than 2:00pm on 31 January 2011.  This should not be construed to be a request for proposal or a solicitation of an offer.

Fitch Ratings' Support rating provides important insight relative to the likelihood and nature of external support should the financial institution experience financial difficulties. Ratings guidelines are applied to long and short-term foreign currency ratings; long and short-term local currency ratings; and National ratings for emerging markets (non-comparable across borders). Any responses received as a result of this notice, shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive requirement. Responses will NOT be considered as either proposals or bids. A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition, based upon any written responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This requirement is for the annual renewal subscription to the Journal Citation reports (JCR) - Science Ed Database, for a base year with four (4) option years. Journal Citation Report is the recognized authority for evaluating journals and presents quantifiable statistical data that provides a systematic, objective way to evaluate the world's leading journals and their impact and influence in the global research community. It is the only known journal evaluation resource on the market that provides statistical information based on citation data. NIST needs a tool that can help them discover where to find the current reading lists in their respective fields. By compiling articles cited references-supplied by the publishing authors themselves-JCR Web helps to measure research influence and impact at the journal and category levels, and show the relationships between citing and cited journals. The additional data makes it easier for NIST to understand performance metrics in context and facilitate collection management decisions. This tool gives NIST a competitive advantage by enabling those involved with the JCR to monitor its competitors, identify new publishing opportunities, see how JCR ranks against the competition and make decisions regarding current publications. NIST benefits because this tool can identify the best journals in which to publish their data, confirm the status of journals in which they have previously published, and identify journals relevant to their research. This tool works in conjunction with Web of Science, Science Citation Index Expanded, Scientific Edition, and Ulrichweb to which the NIST currently subscribes. This full integration of Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge lets the Research Library link from Web of Science to JCR Web, from JCR journal records to Ulrichsweb and recent Current Contents Connect tables of contents, and to and from the library's Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC). No other product on the market provides an analysis of the bibliometric trends of scholarly and technical publications. This tool gives NIST a competive advantage in disseminating the results of their research. It helps them to more fully understand their journals' place in the scholarly world. The Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) because the Government has not identified any other source that can meet the requirements specified above. Interested concerns may identify their capabilities by submitting a capability statement that clearly and unambiguously demonstrates in written narrative format their ability to provide the required licenses renewal. Capability statements may be e-mailed to Barbara.Suhrie@nist.gov. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice is not a request for quotation. A determination by the Government whether to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to acquire Communications Center Dispatch Services for Curecanti National Recreation Area from the City of Gunnison.  The period of performance will be for one year, and the estimated cost is $25,000.  The local police department is the only known source with both the capabillity and capacity to perform this effort.

The source of authority permitting this purchase is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1) as stated in

FAR 6.302-1(a)(1), "Only one Responsible Source and No other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."

The Performance Work Statement provides for telephone and radio dispatching services (24 hours / 365 days) in support of law enforcement, emergency services, and general park operations.  The standard for dispatch services is consistent with that of most any professional police and emergency services communications center.  Any delay resulting in the conversion to a new center may adversely impact critical mission objectives.


THERE IS NO PLANNED RELEASE OF A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION AND THIS DOES NOT SERVE AS RFQ.


ANY QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS NOTICE MUST BE RECEIVED BY MONDAY, JANUARY 3, 2011, 4 PM MST.SEND TO: debra_ohagan@nps.gov

<p><br />PART 3 - DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATIONS/WORK STATEMENT <br />3. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES <br />The Division performs laboratory research related to drug safety. An important aspect of this research is to determine drug induced injury on the tissue and cellular levels. This information and information about mechanisms of injury can be obtained by analyzing histopathology changes from tissue derived from in vivo animal toxicology studies. Tissue samples from animal toxicology studies are embedded and sectioned onto glass slides. The Aperio equipment allows glass slides to scanned into digital images that can then be stored, shared, and analyzed with accompanying image analysis software. Presently, this equipment is used to support multiple projects within CDER as well as collaborative studies with other FDA Centers. The Division requires these capabilities to fulfill current study protocols and evolving experimental aims.</p>
<p>Preventative maintenance and a service contract are required to keep this equipment functioning properly and have timely repairs as needed. If the instrument is out of service, there is no readily available replacement instrument to complete this work. A service contract is justified for this instrument due to the high replacement cost of this instrument ($250,000.00). Up to this point, this instrument has been under the original manufacturer's warranty and service agreement.</p>
<p>Service Requirements:</p>
<p>The Contractor shall provide:<br />1) Annual onsite preventative maintenance including evaluation of all hardware and required calibrations, alignments, cleaning, and parts replacement; <br />2) Software upgrades as they become available; <br />3) Technical support within the limits of the vendor's regular operating hours. <br />4) Additional on-site service calls and replacement parts as needed.<br />5) New or Certified replacement parts. <br />6) Service Technicians authorized by Olympus USA to service their equipment so that it does not void the manufacturer's warranty.<br />7) Loaner unit if service will be extensive.<br />8) Cost, Travel, Parts shall be included by the contractor.</p>

Selection will be based on the following evaluation factors, in order of importance: (1) Offerors capability to provide a quality service and facility that meets the Government's needs; (2) Past performance, caliber of offerors performance on previous contracts of a similar nature; and (3) Total cost or price. <BR>Note on Price Evaluation factor:<BR>Prices for food, inclusive of all service fees shall not exceed the per diem rates for breakfast and lunch for the location of the hotel.  Prices for lodging shall not exceed the per diem rate for the location of the hotel and applicable time of year. There are several steps to determine maximum allowable meal charge.  <BR>Step 1: Go to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/100120. <BR>Step 2: Identify the correct location of your facility. <BR>Step 3: Go to the last column on the right to determine the Meals and Incidental Expense rate. <BR>Step 4: Go to http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/101518. <BR>Step 5: Identify the corresponding M&IE rate column. <BR>Step 6: Locate the breakfast and lunch rates. For example, Brockton, MA falls under Plymouth/Taunton/New Bedford. As such the daily M&IE rate is $51.00.  The M&IE breakdown reveals that breakfast cannot exceed $8.00 and lunch cannot exceed $12.00.  Rates for Boston are $12.00 and $18.00 respectively.<BR>Prices for lodging shall not exceed the per diem rate for your hotel location and applicable time period.<BR>Hotel room lodging numbers are for estimating and pricing purposes only.  The government will confirm minimum number of rooms no later than 3:00 p.m. on the Monday prior to the event. The hotel shall identify in its proposal the latest date and time for the government to increase the number of rooms at the rate identified in the price proposal. <BR>Final guarantees for food shall be given 72 hours before the first meal. <BR>Invoicing shall be based on minimum guarantees for rooms and food plus other costs such as meeting rooms, audio-visual equipment rental, etc., plus any additional meals served or rooms occupied by conference attendees following the furnishing of the minimum guarantees.  Only the Government's conference coordinator or alternate is authorized to increase the number of meals or rooms after the guarantees are submitted. The conference coordinator or alternate must first contact the contracting officer before adding meals or rooms after the guarantees are submitted.<BR> <BR>APPLICABLE PROVISIONS AND CLAUSES: The following clauses and provisions are incorporated by reference.

<DESC>This is a request for Architect-Engineer (A-E) Qualifications statements from A-E firms interested in providing A-E services for the U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Building 1 Renovation (B1R) project on NIST's Boulder, CO campus. This procurement is being conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Brooks Act as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 36.6. The NAICS code for this project is 541310.
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>Building 1 at NIST Boulder (also known as the Radio Building) was constructed in 1954. Building 1 is a cast-in-place reinforced concrete building. It serves as the main laboratory facility for research and measurements at NIST Boulder, supporting the NIST mission to provide measurements, standards, and technology that advance economic growth and address national needs. Building 1 comprises a total of 300,000 square feet, and includes administrative and support staff offices as well as laboratories. Building 1 includes a wide range of laboratory facilities that support research and measurements in areas such as electronics, nanotechnology, time and frequency measurements, quantum computing and quantum communications, laser science, optics, superconducting sensors, radio-frequency communications, magnetic field measurements, and many other areas. In many of these areas NIST Boulder performs the world's best research and measurements, including the world's leading quantum computing research programs, the world's most accurate atomic clocks, and some of the world's most sensitive measurements using unique superconducting devices. Building 1 also includes two clean room facilities for the fabrication of unique nanoscale instruments that are used for NIST Boulder research and measurements. The extremely demanding and sensitive research and measurements performed in Building 1 require tight control of environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, humidity, and air quality.</p>
<p>Environmental and space requirements for the B1R are based on extensive programmatic studies of NIST's technically demanding scientific programs, many of which directly or indirectly support US competitiveness. The building environmental requirements for programs slated for the B1R are not being effectively and economically met with laboratory space currently occupying a structure dedicated in 1954. Renovation of Building 1 is a necessity for NIST's continued long-term support of US industrial competitiveness in the world market. The B1R will provide extensive renovation of approximately half of Building 1, including Wings 3, 5, 6 and a portion of the Center Spine. This will provide 80,000 net assignable square feet of high performance laboratory space to perform research and measurements needed by industry and the scientific community. The renovation will support key technology areas such as nanotechnology, biotechnology, new energy sources, computing and telecommunications in a high performance facility. Renovated spaces shall be sufficient to support NIST's vision well into the 21st Century and will be supportive of infrastructure recently developed on site. The finished environment shall be supportive of internal collaboration and informal interaction and shall be energy efficient. The complexity of the program is evident from the numerous and diverse research divisions and support organizations located on the campus. The B1R consists of enhanced temperature control down to +/- 0.5 degree C, humidity control to +/- 5%, continuous air flow with filtration to class 10,000, vibration control, and new service corridors to provide lab support space for utilities in addition to the pedestrian corridor.</p>
<p>Electrical elements included in the renovation will address components such as lighting, power distribution, power quality, electromagnetic interference, and standby emergency power for critical laboratory functions. The B1R will locate the bus ducts in the service corridors. Chilled water, steam, and compressed air will be supplied from the Boulder Site's Central Utility Plant. Communication elements that will be addressed include infrastructure components such as telephone cabling and fiber optic networks for data. Life safety and building security elements in the renovation include components such as fire alarm systems, fire sprinkler systems, and building access control. Renovation design and construction will comply with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and will be submitted for LEED (Silver) certification for existing buildings.</p>
<p>This project must demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The A-E firm shall provide pre-construction services to include detailed cost estimating of a $40 - $80 million construction contract for the Building 1 Renovation on a federal campus. In addition to cost estimating, the selected A/E shall provide constructability reviews, value engineering recommendations, provide design reviews at the various design submittal stages for two years. Due to the size of the project, the Architectural-Engineering (A-E) firm's contract with NIST is projected to range from $3.5 to $5 million dollars for design services to include all architecture, engineering, hazardous material/soil testing, inspections, laboratory de-commissioning standards, survey work, coordination with multiple federal, state, and local agencies and municipalities.</p>
<p>The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: Professional Architecture and Engineering Services. NIST estimates that 65% of the design will fall under the engineering discipline while the remaining 35% will fall under the architectural discipline. The scope of work will require at a minimum: construction drawings, specifications, cost estimates, value engineering services, computer-aided design and drafting (CADD), (BIM) and post construction contract services (PCCS) for a federal campus that includes the decommissioning of existing laboratories and the construction of interior and exterior upgrades, site development, client program requirements, and sustainable features. The facility will be designed in English Units.</p>
<p>Summary of Project Design Requirements:<br />&bull; Develop a master plan of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems.<br />&bull; Identify required system capacities.<br />&bull; Integrate utility plan into project scope<br />&bull; Create Building 1 project scope, budget, and phasing with assistance of project stakeholders.<br />&bull; Add and integrate utility infrastructure into architectural and structural revisions to Building 1.<br />&bull; Integrate and upgrade office and research laboratory requirements into existing spaces. <br />&bull; Upgrade building elements to comply with current code requirements.</p>

Pursuant to Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d), as amended by the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, all electronic and information technology (EIT) products and services developed, acquired, maintained, and/or used under this contract/order must comply with the "Electronic and Information Technology Accessibility Provisions" set forth by the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (also referred to as the "Access Board") in 36 CFR part 1194. Information about Section 508 provisions is available at http://www.hhs.gov/od.</p>
<p>Section 508 Acceptance Criteria <br />Responses to this solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT, VPAT or equivalent and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.</p>
<p>The "Annotated Dr. Martin M. Cummings' Digital Manuscript Collection" delivered as a result of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. The "Annotated Dr. Martin M. Cummings' Digital Manuscript Collection" delivered must include a completed GPAT, a template of which is included as a part of this solicitation.</p>
<p><br />SOLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION</p>
<p>The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has determined that Cheryl Rae Dee, Ph.D., is uniquely qualified to meet NLM's needs for the project of organizing and preparing for digitization the papers of the former Library Director, Dr. Martin M. Cummings. While other vendors could perform the technical work associated with the project, the proposed Contractor has had the most extensive experience with the Cumming's papers and has broad-based knowledge of NLM and its programmatic history during the years from 1964-1984 when Cummings was Director. Through previous related work, Dr. Dee has demonstrated she can perform the assignment in an effective and timely manner even while adjusting to last minute changes in Dr. Cummings' availability. This is especially critical to the successful completion of this project as Dr. Cummings' age and physical condition require a Contractor who can adjust to Dr. Cummings' schedule and physical stamina. Most importantly, Dr. Dee has built up a unique rapport with Dr. Cummings and he has developed a substantial comfort level with her.</p>
<p>While the relationship of trust is critical, the Contractor must also possess a strong knowledge of the history of Dr. Cummings' years as NLM Director and must have extensive familiarity with the source material to be organized and digitized. In addition to the unique capabilities of the Contractor, the requirement must be initiated and completed quickly as the Library intends to make much of the digitized material accessible in 2011, when it celebrates its 175th anniversary. In summary, Dr. Dee possesses the exact degree of technical and operational skills necessary to accomplish the specific goals and outcomes in a timely and effective manner. Any efforts to identify the required skills and expertise through other sources would pose additional undo costs to the government. Therefore, in the best interest of the government this purchase order should be awarded to Cheryl Rae Dee, Ph.D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is a RFQ available; however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM. Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide the referenced service as specified above. Responses must be in writing and must be received electronically at the Government infrastructure by 4:00 PM EST on Friday, January 7, 2011. Proposals must include pricing information and should reference Synopsis No. NLM-11-034/SRE and should be submitted to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov. Inquiries regarding this procurement shall be submitted electronically to sheila.edmonds@nih.gov and shall be received by 12:00 PM EST on Thursday, December 30, 2010.</p>

<DESC>The&nbsp;Office of Second Line of Defense (SLD)&nbsp;is part of the DOE National Nuclear Security Administration.&nbsp; The SLD Program accomplishes its critical global security mission by forming cooperative relationships with partner countries to install passive radiaiton detection systems that augment traditional inspection and law enforcement measures by alerting border officials to the presence of special nuclear or other radiological materials in cross-border traffic.&nbsp; An important tenet of the program is to work collaboratively with these countries to establish the necessary processes, procedures, infrastruture and conditions that will enable them to fully assume the financial and technical responsibilities for operating the equipment. <br /><br />The equipment is required to operate continuously, often at remote locations with diminshed infrastructure.&nbsp; In order to promote maximum operation savailability there must be a maintenance competency and a commensurate inventory of spare parts and consumables.&nbsp; As the number of operational deployments grows, the SLD program faces an increasingly complex logistics process to assu timely and efficient supply of spare parts. <br /><br />The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) has been designated by DOE-SLD to work closely with partner countries to jointly develop sustainability plans that are designed to ensure installed radiation detection systems remain effective not only throughout the sustainability period, but also once partner countries ssume full responsibility fro the performance of the systems.&nbsp; PNNL has indentified the need to find an independent orgranization with special subject matter expertiese that will serve as a technical consultant in teh area of service parts supply chain support. <br /><br />The objective of the Parts/Logistics consultant is to review the current needs of the SLD program, regarding the supply of spare parts and provide recommendations for assuring the timely supply of spare parts.&nbsp;

<DESC>Building Type: Federal Office Building
<p>Historic Structure: [X] NO</p>
<p>Client Agencies: The major tenant is the United States Social Security Administration (SSA).</p>
<p>Size: The project encompasses approximately 619,000 square feet on a site fully developed within a 6 level office structure with both underground and surface level parking.</p>
<p>Budget: Estimated Construction Cost for all (3) phases is between $200,000,000 and $230,000,000</p>
<p>Geographic Limitation: This project is open nationwide</p>
<p>Small Business Set Aside: As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established Region 9 subcontracting goals of 30% for small businesses, 3% HUB Zone Small Business, 5% for Women-Owned Small Business, 5% for Small Disadvantaged Business, 3% for Veteran-Owned Small Business, 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business.</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to modernize our federal buildings and prepare them for the next 50-100 years of service. Federal Buildings must be high performance green facilities that demonstrate the value of true integrated design and harmonize aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability to enhance human productivity and creativity. The goal is to create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees that give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all Federal facilities will meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Orders 13423 and 13514; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating of Silver, at a minimum, and if possible Gold with specific credits required. The developed facility plan must delineate dimensions and volumes in metric units.</p>
<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The General Services Administration (GSA) proposes a repair and alteration project for the existing Frank Hagel Federal Building (FHFB) located in the downtown central business district of Richmond, California. The SSA has been the sole tenant agency of FHFB (since building completion) which serves as their regional headquarters.</p>
<p>Since construction in 1975, the tower building has not undergone any significant major renovations except for auditorium seismic retrofit in 1991, childcare center addition and building systems repair (waterproofing, exterior sitework, security, and elevator) completed in 1996.</p>
<p>This repair and alteration prospectus will encompass a total realignment of the building's space in order to re-arrange the operating groups into a more efficient and functional space and a building systems modernization including seismic, security, waterproofing, electrical distribution and hazardous material removal.</p>
<p>Since the building was constructed, , various SSA operating groups have grown in an organic manner taking space as available as a result, many operating groups are spread across a floor and/or multiple floors utilizing space inefficiently.</p>
<p>The proposed multi-phased project assumes concurrent building space realignment and systems modernization which minimize cost and disruption to SSA while not unduly burdening the GSA's capital program in a specific fiscal year.</p>
<p>The proposed project is planned to be a multi-phase repair and alteration and seismic upgrade project entailing the design of phases 1, 2, &amp; 3 in FY2011 and the construction of Phase 1 beginning in FY2012; Phase 2 in FY2014; and Phase 3 in FY2016.</p>

ANCDF expects these flow restrictions to continue to occur on the MPF, DFS and LIC furnaces, Pollution Abatement Systems, and Brine Reduction Areas due to salt formed as a result of the reactions of mustard agent.

<p><br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br /><br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D.C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

<p><br /><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

 Statement of Work

1.  Occupationally exposed health care professionals are provided with film-badge and/or quarterly monitoring by solid state thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD).  Monthly evaluation of occupationally absorbed dose is calibrated in millirems or millijoules of energy per kilogram of tissue.
2.  The approved vendor must be an approved member of the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
3.  Potential vendors, for dosimetry services shall not require on-line management of their dosimetry account that would require the exchange of hundreds of names, dates of birth, and social security numbers (fax & mail).
4.  Otherwise, Information Security Officer(ISO)and Information Resource Management IRM) must concur with any installation of vendor provided proprietary software to manage their dosimetry account and provide this Office with training appropriate to the on-line management of the vendors dosimetry account.  In addition, the Information Security Officer (ISO) must concur with any exchange of routine personal data: names, dates of birth, and social security numbers.  
Constant coordination with IRM and the ISO may severely reduce the timeliness of the radiation safety dosimetry program. 
5.  Monitoring fourteen Services for occupationally exposure to ionizing radiation from gamma radiation, neutron fluence rate, and x-rays is a requirement of our VHA-NHPP Permit; the VHA Master Material License; the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), Title 10 Code of Regulation, Part 19; and U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910.1096.
6.  Use of a range of between 356 and 391 monthly film-badge monitoring insures that approved personnel do not exceed a quarterly or annual limit of absorbed dose as prescribed by law. Use of approximately 356 film-badges, 51 TLD environmental, ring, and wrist monitors, and 16 neutron monitors may vary by ten per cent as new occupationally exposed individuals are added to the Program or terminated from Service.
7.  Monthly monitoring of occupationally exposed health care professionals is not limited to staff, but also includes monitoring for the embryo/fetus of the Declared Pregnant Woman upon use of properly calibrated fetal monitors.  Monthly film-badge monitoring insures that the fetal-dose does not exceed a quarterly limit of absorbed dose as prescribed by regulations.
8. Quarterly monitoring of designated open spaces, waiting rooms, laboratories, and offices insure patients, staff, and members of the public that annual limits of absorbed dose as prescribed by regulations are not exceeded.
9. Each Service must be provided a monthly Occupational Exposure Record, and individuals are provided an Annual Form 5: Occupational Exposure Record of their radiation absorbed dose greater than 100 millirems.  Quarterly ALARA reports are forwarded to the Radiation Safety Committee.  Reports of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation are protected as occupational medical records.

     (1) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
     (2) [  ] Have, [  ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or Commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
     (3) [  ] Are, [  ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and

       (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
          (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
         (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.
        (ii) Examples.
          (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
          (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
          (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
          (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
 
   (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).
      (1) Listed end products.

      (2) __ Outside the United States. 
   (k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.)
      [  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror [  ] does [  ] does not certify that--

        (ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003- 4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and

        (iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers.
      (3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies--
 
       (i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and
        (ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
   (l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701).  (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

The Bureau of Reclamation has a requirement for a Riparian Bird Survey to be performed in the Lower Colorado Region.  This survey will utilize the double sampling area search method to estimate population density and long-term population trends of riparian birds in the LCR MSCP planning area and in LCR MSCP habitat conservation areas.  The survey is also needed to measure the habitat use of six (6) LCR MSCP covered species. To determine if it is in the Government's best interest to award this requirement to a private source or to a Federal, state or local government agency, market research is being conducted concurrently with the solicitation of this requirement. Reclamation reserves the right to award either a commercial contract or an interagency acquisition.  Commercial contractors and government agencies that offer avian monitoring services are being notified and asked to consider offering. 
Site Visit:  To assure that offerors fully understand the scope of work, the various habitats and work site conditions, Reclamation will hold a Pre-Bid Site Meeting.

<DESC>Question and Answer for Sources Sought Announcement - Mounted Soldier Cordless Communication, Display, & Cooling Subsystems<BR><BR>1. Was there a previous contractor that fulfilled these requirements?  If so, please provide the relevant contract information.<BR><BR>ANSWER:  The Government has previously awarded relevant development contracts for these items.  The contractors for these efforts are as follows:<BR><BR>Communication Subsystem:<BR> <BR>Contractor:  THALES<BR><BR>Contractor #: W91 CRB-09-P-0093<BR><BR>Value Initial: $3,186,150 <BR><BR>Award Date: 23 Apr 09<BR><BR><BR>Display Subsystem:<BR><BR>Contractor: ROCKWELL COLLINS<BR><BR>Contractor #: W91 CRB-09-P-0066<BR><BR>Initial Value: $1,052,000<BR><BR>Award Date: 30 Mar 09<BR><BR><BR>Cooling Subsystem: <BR><BR>Contractor: COBHAM<BR><BR>Contractor #: W91 CRB-09-P-0109<BR><BR>Initial Value: $751,356<BR><BR>Award Date: 8 May 09<BR><BR><BR>2.  I'm interested in receiving the technical data associated with this SSA, how do we go about doing so?<BR><BR>Answer:  The Government will not provide any technical data other than what was provided in the RFI.  Should this action result in a competitive solicitation, it will most likely be procured via a performance specification.  <BR><BR><BR>3.   The solicitation calls out a need for 2 different cooling systems - the Microclimate Unit (MCU2) and the Microclimate Unit- Next Generation (MCU-NG).  Only 1 estimated quantity forecast is given (351, 466, 528, 627, 719).  Can you please explain if this quantity applies to potentially procure that quantity of each system or is this the total quantity to be split between the 2 products?  Can you define what the quantity split is?<BR><BR>Answer:    An Excel spreadsheet indicating Cooling Subsystem estimates may be requested by contacting Daniel Poehling at daniel.poehling@us.army.mil or Joseph Badalamenti at joseph.badalamenti@us.army.mil.  Keep in mind these are only estimates. Each estimated vehicle-mounted component quantity may contain 1-3 MCU per platform in various configurations (MCU2 and/or MCU-NG).  For the fraction of the SBCT, we do not have a priority list so it is undeterminable at this time as the exact vehicles that will be required per year.    <BR><BR><BR>4.  "The soldier component consists of: microclimate cooling garment<BR>(MCG)."  Is this statement synonymous with the estimated soldier worn quantities?  In other words, are the MCG quantities 1,052, 1,309, 1,448, 1,669, 2,026? <BR><BR>Answer: Yes, these are the estimated quantities.<BR><BR><BR>5.  Does the line "Estimated Vehicle Mounted Quantities" entail the following content to be considered- 1 microclimate unit, umbilicals, and manifolds only?  <BR><BR>Answer:  Content to be considered:  Micro-climate unit, umbilical hoses, controller and manifolds.  <BR><BR><BR>6.  Garments are quoted on a separate line under soldier component, correct? <BR><BR>Answer: Yes.  <BR><BR><BR>7.  "A" kit hardware is not considered in this solicitation, correct? <BR><BR>Answer: Yes.<BR><BR>

<DESC>Question and Answer for Sources Sought Announcement - Mounted Soldier Cordless Communication, Display, & Cooling Subsystems<BR><BR>1. Was there a previous contractor that fulfilled these requirements?  If so, please provide the relevant contract information.<BR><BR>ANSWER:  The Government has previously awarded relevant development contracts for these items.  The contractors for these efforts are as follows:<BR><BR>Communication Subsystem:<BR> <BR>Contractor:  THALES<BR><BR>Contractor #: W91 CRB-09-P-0093<BR><BR>Value Initial: $3,186,150 <BR><BR>Award Date: 23 Apr 09<BR><BR><BR>Display Subsystem:<BR><BR>Contractor: ROCKWELL COLLINS<BR><BR>Contractor #: W91 CRB-09-P-0066<BR><BR>Initial Value: $1,052,000<BR><BR>Award Date: 30 Mar 09<BR><BR><BR>Cooling Subsystem: <BR><BR>Contractor: COBHAM<BR><BR>Contractor #: W91 CRB-09-P-0109<BR><BR>Initial Value: $751,356<BR><BR>Award Date: 8 May 09<BR><BR><BR>2.  I'm interested in receiving the technical data associated with this SSA, how do we go about doing so?<BR><BR>Answer:  The Government will not provide any technical data other than what was provided in the RFI.  Should this action result in a competitive solicitation, it will most likely be procured via a performance specification.  <BR><BR><BR>3.   The solicitation calls out a need for 2 different cooling systems - the Microclimate Unit (MCU2) and the Microclimate Unit- Next Generation (MCU-NG).  Only 1 estimated quantity forecast is given (351, 466, 528, 627, 719).  Can you please explain if this quantity applies to potentially procure that quantity of each system or is this the total quantity to be split between the 2 products?  Can you define what the quantity split is?<BR><BR>Answer:  An Excel spreadsheet indicating Cooling Subsystem estimates may be requested by contacting Daniel Poehling at daniel.poehling@us.army.mil or Joseph Badalamenti at joseph.badalamenti@us.army.mil.  Keep in mind these are only estimates. Each estimated vehicle-mounted component quantity may contain 1-3 MCU per platform in various configurations (MCU2 and/or MCU-NG).  For the fraction of the SBCT, we do not have a priority list so it is undeterminable at this time as the exact vehicles that will be required per year.    <BR><BR><BR>4.  "The soldier component consists of: microclimate cooling garment<BR>(MCG)."  Is this statement synonymous with the estimated soldier worn quantities?  In other words, are the MCG quantities 1,052, 1,309, 1,448, 1,669, 2,026? <BR><BR>Answer: Yes, these are the estimated quantities.<BR><BR><BR>5.  Does the line "Estimated Vehicle Mounted Quantities" entail the following content to be considered- 1 microclimate unit, umbilicals, and manifolds only?  <BR><BR>Answer:  Content to be considered:  Micro-climate unit, umbilical hoses, controller and manifolds.  <BR><BR><BR>6.  Garments are quoted on a separate line under soldier component, correct? <BR><BR>Answer: Yes.  <BR><BR><BR>7.  "A" kit hardware is not considered in this solicitation, correct? <BR><BR>Answer: Yes.<BR>

<p><br />DSCP anticipates issuing a solicitation for the referenced item(s) under indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC). The IQC is a long term contract designed to provide for an indefinite quantity, within stated limits, of supplies or services to be furnished during a specific period, with deliveries or performance to schedule by placing an order with the contractor. The contract is intended for use with items for which recurring demands may be anticipated, as a means of reducing the time and expense required soliciting and making repetitive awards. Based on the indefinite quantities the awarded may receive awards on unknown quantities for the award year, with a guaranteed minimum and a stated not to exceed maximum. The contract may be for a term of one year with&nbsp;three option years. Further it may contain an option to extend the term of the contract. If an option to extend the term of the contract provision is included in the solicitation, each option term would be one year.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) plans to award a contract for the procurement of an ASSC system. The following is a summary of the ASSC requirement as previously communicated by the Government via previous public announcements posted in the Federal Aviation Administration Contract Opportunities (FAACO) website:   
	The Airport Surface Surveillance Capability (ASSC) is the proposed acquisition for the FAA ATO organization and supports the objectives of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen).  The ASSC establishes the requirement to integrate a cooperative airport ground domain surveillance system by leveraging Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) technology within the architecture of the ASSC.  Among its benefits, aircraft will be able to fly at reduced separation while maintaining current levels of safety when using ADS-B.  Thus ASSC, coupled with ASD-B, will improve safety, operational efficiency, and situational awareness at FAA airports
	Under this procurement, nine (9) Airport Surface Detection Equipment-Model 3 (ASDE-3) systems will be replaced with ASSC.
1.	San Francisco International (SFO) Airport (Key Site w/First Article requirements)2.	Cleveland/Hopkins International (CLE) Airport (Key Site)3.	Andrews Air Force Base (ADW)4.	Anchorage International (ANC) Airport 5.	Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International (CVG) Airport6.	Kansas City International (MCI) Airport7.	New Orleans International (MSY) Airport8.	Portland International (PDX) Airport9.	Pittsburgh International (PIT) Airport
An Option requirement for one (1) to eight (8) ASSC systems may be exercised as part of the anticipated contract award. 
	The anticipated contract award comprises all system requirement components necessary to integrate and implement the ASSC system as part of the National Airspace System (NAS) including: system development, integration, test, and acceptance of a First Article (pre-production) system, delivery of production systems, training, logistics, and engineering support.   
The FAA anticipates awarding a three (3) year contract for the ASSC First Article and production systems. As noted above, an Option requirement may be exercised for additional systems with a period of performance of up to 18 months.

<p style="mso-layout-grid-align: none">Smithsonian institution is issuing&nbsp;a request for proposal for a Construction Management at Risk Contract (CMc) for the construction of the NATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY AND CULTURE (NMAAHC). The proposed contract listed here is UNRESTRICTED. All responsible sources are encouraged to submit a proposal, which will be considered by the Smithsonian. The new NMAAHC museum will be constructed on the National Mall near the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. The site is approximately five acres in area and bounded by Constitution Avenue and Madison Drive, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Streets, NW. The site will be developed with landscaping and improvements to be used for outdoor museum programs in a manner consistent with its context and contributing to a National Historic Landmark on the National Mall.

The new museum will include exhibition galleries, performance and public program spaces, a theater, food service, and retail. Non-public spaces will include a loading dock, collections handling and work rooms, administrative offices, and support spaces. The design will incorporate state-of the-art technologies for exhibits, research, and communications, and the new facility is planned to achieve LEED Gold certification. The Smithsonian anticipates awarding a contract for pre-construction services by mid 2011 and commencing of site preparation activity in late 2011. The Smithsonian expects contractor turnover of the building for the installation of exhibits starting in late 2014 and the new museum will open to the public in November 2015 to coincide with symbolic moments in the narrative of American history.</p>
<p>The selected CMc shall provide Pre-construction Phase Services and Construction Phase Services through a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) agreement. Total period of performance including Pre-construction and Construction is estimated to be from notice to proceed in April 2011 to substantial completion in November 2014. The estimated construction cost is between $240,000,000 and $290,000,000. Critical elements of the work include, but are not limited to; pre-construction services, site work, utility work, excavation, sheeting &amp; shoring (slurry wall), foundations, dewatering, concrete and steel super-structure, landscape and hardscape, high level architectural finishes (both interior and exterior), MEP systems, elevators, roofing, exterior curtain wall with unique fa&ccedil;ade treatment, food service equipment, and theater specialties. Additional requirements for performance include: procedures and documentation to ensure compliance with the established LEED building criteria; practices, procedures and documentation related to integrated building commissioning; and knowledge of procedures for the use of BIM.</p>
<p>Firm evaluation and selection will be conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Best Value Procurement, utilizing a two-step procurement model. Step I of the RFP will consist of a list of prequalifying criteria to assist the agency in identifying those CMc contractors that have demonstrated past specialized experience in comparable and non-comparable CMc projects and other relevant qualifying factors. It is the Smithsonian's intent to advance the most highly qualified companies for further consideration under Step II, technical and pricing evaluation of the RFP. Companies which are advanced to Step II of the RFP will be evaluated in accordance with the technical criteria as set forth in the RFP</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) for this procurement is 236220 and the size standard under this code is $33.5 million average annual receipts over the last three years.

The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal. Any prime or joint venture found to be officially notified of non-compliance on past contracts and the non-compliance is outstanding will not be considered for this project. Failure to adequately explain reasons for not meeting previous contract goals may result in a lower overall rating and ultimate non-selection. An approved small business-subcontracting plan will be required prior to award.

Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.bpn.gov.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

If the selected firm is a large business, a subcontracting plan consistent with PL 95-507, PL 99-661 and PL 100-656 will be required with the proposal. A minimum goal of 40% of the total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with small business concerns. At least 20% of total planned subcontracting dollars shall be placed with Small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), including Historically Black Colleges and Universities or Minority Institutions; 10% with Women-owned small businesses (WOSB); 10% shall be placed with Hub-zone Small Businesses (HubZone), 5% with Veteran-owned small businesses (VOSB); and 5% with Service Disabled Veteran-owned small businesses (SDV). The subcontracting plan is not required with this submittal. Any prime or joint venture found to be officially notified of non-compliance on past contracts and the non-compliance is outstanding will not be considered for this project. Failure to adequately explain reasons for not meeting previous contract goals may result in a lower overall rating and ultimate non-selection. An approved small business-subcontracting plan will be required prior to award. Prospective contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract. Information on registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained by calling 1-888-227-2423 or via the Internet at http://www.bpn.gov. Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. TELEPHONE OR EMAIL REQUESTS WILL NOT BE HONORED.

With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representations and certification information, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation<br />for<br />Deepening of the Port Jersey Channel<br /><br />The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to award a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract to perform dredging of the Port Jersey Channel, in accordance with FAR 15.101-2, Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) Source Selection Process. The solicitation number for this project is W912DS-11-R-0001.<br /><br />The New York Harbor and Adjacent Channels, Port Jersey Channel, Contract No. 4 (PJ-4) Project consists of deepening of the Port Jersey Channel to El. -50-ft MLW along the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners (PVSC) Outfall Tunnel corridor. The PVSC Outfall Tunnel begins at the PVSC Treatment Plant (Plant) in Newark, NJ and extends in a southeasterly direction beneath the Port Jersey Channel in Bayonne and terminates at the Terminal Chamber (TC) in Upper New York Bay. Within the Port Jersey Channel, the deepening considers the stability of the PVSC 144-inch diameter pipe outfall tunnel and the removal of overburden material during the dredging operations. The dredging operations within the Port Jersey Channel over the PVSC Outfall Tunnel will typically lower the existing mud line of approximately El. 44.5-ft MLW to a final dredging depth of El. -52.0-ft MLW. The design of protective measures for the PVSC Outfall Tunnel includes installing a 5-inch thick steel plate over the Outfall Tunnel in order to protect the tunnel and provide additional overburden weight. The plate is extended a minimum of 15 feet beyond centerline of the Outfall Tunnel for a total length of 30 ft. The top of the plate, after final construction, will be at El. -52.0-ft MWL or below. The non-rock materials suitable for the HARS placement will be placed at the designated HARS site. The non-rock materials unsuitable for the HARS placement will be placed at an Upland Placement Facility and/or at the Confined Disposal Facility (CDF) of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey located at the entrance of Elizabeth Channel. The scope of work also includes the sampling and testing of subsurface materials if needed.<br /><br />It is anticipated that construction would take place within 270 days, including options.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to update industry on the status of the CG-LIMS project, to provide additional relevant documentation, and to invite industry input. <br /><br />1. Last April we announced that there would be no RFP in Calendar 2010 and that a draft RFP would be released four to six months prior to the final RFP. We are&nbsp;re-assessing our acquisition strategy and have currently no anticipated release timeframe for either draft or final RFP. We will announce the anticipated dates as soon as practicable. <br /><br />2. The CONOPS has been signed and is posted. At industry request we are also posting operating manuals for several legacy USCG systems with which CG-LIMS will interface, or which it will replace. The documents included with this posting are listed below. The ALMIS documentation is currently not in appropriate format, but is being prepared for release and will be posted when it is ready.
<p>&bull; CG-LIMS Concept of Operations (CONOPS) dated 5 June 2010;<br />&bull; CG-TIMS Manual<br />&bull; CMPlus Job Aids<br />&bull; FLS Basics<br />&bull; FLS Overview<br />&bull; NESSS User Guide<br />&bull; SAM Manual<br /><br />3. While FedBizOpps will continue to be the primary and only official location for industry communication from the Contracting Officer, the Project Manager invites your input on acquisition strategy. As a tool in reviewing CG-LIMS strategy, the Coast Guard is using a public wiki located at http://wiki.citizen.apps.gov/CGLIMS. We are not looking for specific solutions or tools or corporate marketing efforts, but seek strategic industry input to enable a more efficient, less costly acquisition of the capability the Coast Guard needs. Please note that this wiki is a completely public forum and that all input will be provided at no cost to the government.</p>

<DESC>Questions and Answers Round 1
12/22/2010

1. Is CDN new work or is there currently a contractor fulfilling the same work?  If it is not new work, who is the current contractor performing the work?

A: This work is currently being performed by FedStore Corporation.

2.  This appears to be a very well thought out and comprehensive project.  I am concerned that we will not be able to effectively respond to all of the requirements within the requested timeframe and as a result will not be able to effectively compete for this opportunity.  Can you please clarify why the timeframe for the response is so short (especially given that it is over a holiday weekend)?

A: This is strictly a sources sought notice, not a formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  At this time the Government is looking for capability statements that demonstrate a vendor's ability to perform the required work, not a complete proposal.

This changed work was unknown at the time of contract award. The presence of these materials severely impacted the planned progress for the project due to a later that planned start of the work as a result of Government delay in the award of<BR> the contract. As the project cofferdam had been pre-fabricated off-site based upon an approved design, modifications to same were performed as needed to accommodate the Gate No. 04 sill. In addition, to expedite the project and minimize future winter weather impacts, the contractor secured additional steel members to facilitate the re-use of the fabricated cofferdam sections for Gate Nos. 01 and 02. In addition due to the extended performance period, the prime contractor will occur added field overhead costs oversight labor, office rental and site utilities.<BR><BR>B.

SECTION 01 50 00 TEMPORARY CONSTRUCTION FACILITIES<BR><BR>(A)	Add the following new subparagraph:<BR><BR>"1.9.2.1 Due to a Differing Site Condition where the property adjacent to Storage Area 1 was sold after award of the contract and the new owner of that property needed the space that was originally set aside for use by the Contractor to demolish existing buildings on the property, the Contractor had to use other area on the property. This area had a pre-existing condition that contained a washout area in the bituminous pavement that originally was going to be avoided and cordoned off. For safe access, the Contractor was required to cover this area with a steel plate until the buildingsdemolished and materials removed from the property.<BR><BR>3.	SECTION 02 40 00 CONTROL AND DIVERSION OF WATER<BR>4.	<BR>(A)	Add the following new subparagraph to paragraph 3.1<BR><BR>"3.4. Removal of Underwater Debris on the Sill Upstream of Tainter Gates<BR><BR>Due to a Differing Site Condition where unknown underwater debris, gravels, cobbles, boulders, and ledge prevented the installation of the cofferdam on the concrete sill upstream of the tainter gates of the dam, the Contractor was required to remove the debris by clamshell bucket on the floating plant. Due to the presence of an outcrop of ledge at the east pier of Gate 4, the cofferdam design had to be modified and a new underwater steel bracing installed on the concrete pier of the dam. Additional underwater diving was necessary to remove small debris that was unable to be removed by clamshell method and to place additional sand bags to prevent excess seepage through the modified coffer dam sheeting. Furthermore, to expedite the project and minimize future winter weather impacts, the contractor secured additional steel members to facilitate the re-use of the fabricated cofferdam sections for Gate Nos. 01 and 02. The delay in completing the installation of the cofferdam, delayed the start of the abrasive blasting and painting work. In addition due to the extended performance period, the prime contractor will occur added field overhead costs, oversight labor, office rental and site utilities. This equitable adjustment includes impact costs through the period of September 23, 2010 to November 12, 2010<BR><BR><BR><BR>Equitable Adjustment for Differing Site Condition for Removal of Underwater Debris<BR>
