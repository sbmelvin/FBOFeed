<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to negotiate and award on a sole source basis a purchase order under simplified acquisition procedures to Hiroshi Yamamoto, 15303 Gable Ridge Ct. #G., Rockville, Maryland to perform comparative genomic Gene, RNA expression, and direct nucleotide sequence analyses of genes.  The requirement consists of the following:

The contractor shall perform comparative genomic, RNA expression, and direct nucleotide sequence analyses of genes and other potential sequences in the twirler critical region.  It is expected that the project will probably, require up to one year, but the actual length is unpredictable since it is not know when the twirler mutation will be identified.  The period of performance shall be from the date of award.  It is the Government’s belief that these requirements can only be met by Hiroshi Yamamoto.  This is not a formal solicitation; however, concerns that respond to this notice must furnish concise responses directed specifically to the requirements mentioned above.   Sources demonstrating the capability to accomplish the above shall supply pertinent information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to perform.  Information furnished shall include enough material to perform a proper evaluation.  Respondents will not be notified of the evaluation results.

<CONTACT>Elayne  Gomes-Battle, 202-267-3610
<DESC>Anthropometrics Measurements of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Air Transportation System Specialists (ATSSs) THIS REQUIREMENT IS SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESS.  The NAIC Code is 541330. This announcement is a Market Survey.  This announcement is NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR).  Furthermore, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Human Factors Design Standard provides a wide range of anthropometrics data to be used in the design of FAA systems, equipment, and facilities.  However, this data is based on measurements taken on Department of Defense (DoD) military personnel.  Some of the data is based on surveys and studies that were conducted over 50 years ago.  Furthermore, the use of DoD data may not be applicable to the FAA's Air Transportation System Specialist (ATSS) workforce.  To that end, it is desirable to collect anthropometrics measurements from members of the ATSS workforce.   The FAA is seeking potential sources that have the ability to conduct such measurements.  The effort entails determination of the required sample size, develop data collection sheets, perform the required data collection, analyze the data collected, and prepare an update to the FAA Human Factors Design Standard based on the results.  It is envisioned that there will be 25-30 measurements per individual. The contractor will be required to travel to various FAA sites (potentially up to 25) to perform the data collection.  These site visits will be coordinated by the FAA.  In order to minimize the time that the ATSS personnel need to be away from their duties, it is envisioned that there will be separate stations established; one for standing measurements and one for seated measurements.  Personnel to measure the individuals as well as record the data will be required at each station.  In addition, as measurements will be made on female personnel, at least one female measurer will be required.   As a minimum the contractor must possess the following requirements: 1.	Experience in planning and executing large-scale anthropometric measurement, data collection and analysis projects similar to the proposed FAA task 2.	Experience with International standard ISO 15535:2003 "General Requirements for Establishing Anthropometric Databases" 3.	An in-depth understanding of the purpose, structure, and application of FAA Human Factors Design Standards HF-STD-001 4.	Experience in translating substantial amounts of collected anthropometric data into a format suitable for inclusion into engineering design standards such as HF-STD-001 5.	Experience in training measurement team members to the requisite skill level necessary for conducting detailed anthropometric studies The FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Business Declaration form is required to be completed, signed, and submitted with your response to this solicitation.  Vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration at http://www.ccr.gov/ at the time of receipt of proposals. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred associated with response to this Market Survey announcement.  Therefore, any costs associated with this market survey submission will be solely at the interested party's expense. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to 10 pages.   Parties interested that can meet the requirements should reply via email, by close of business Wednesday, March 31, 2006 to the Contract Specialist, Elayne.Gomes-Battle@faa.gov.

DOE purchased two FaxXchange units several years ago as a cost-effective means of transmitting messages to a large number of locations in a time critical environment. NAAT developed and created the FaxXchange System.  NAAT met the departmentâ€™s specific and unique requirements by customizing a combination of multiple off-the-shelf software packages and hardware This unique system supports DOE, programs offices within agency, as well as, global requirements when necessary.  The two FaxXchange units are mission critical to DOEâ€™s emergency notification systems.  NAAT will provide system maintenance support for the FaxXchange.  Maintenance support includes: hardware and software maintenance support for two servers and System Administrator, which comprises the FaxXchange System.  Support will be provided Monday â€“ Friday (except holidays) 9:00am â€“ 5:00pm Eastern Standard Time.  Support for this effort also includes telephone and remote dial-in support, parts and labor. Hardware maintenance includes preventive and remedial (component replacements sent by mail and/or UPS for the System Administrator to replace). Software maintenance includes updates (performed remotely).

<DESC>The National Assessment Governing Board (NAGB) is seeking a contractor to design and implement a procedure to produce recommendations for setting achievement levels for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) for economics at the twelfth grade level.  The Governing Board invites proposals to implement standard setting methodologies and procedures that are appropriate to the assessment and consistent with NAGB policies on achievement levels. (Please refer to www.NAGB.org for more information.)  The procurement is for identifying well-informed and well-qualified panelists to engage in a process of extensive training for making informed judgments regarding the cut scores to represent performance of twelfth grade students on the economics NAEP at the Basic, Proficient, and Advanced levels of achievement.  In addition, proposals will need to identify a methodology for selecting illustrative items to use in reporting student performance relative to the achievement levels. Finally, the proposal will need to identify a procedure for collecting evidence to support the validity of the achievement levels. The Governing Board will determine the achievement levels definitions to be used in the achievement levels-setting process, so no additional work will be required for the definitions.  Scoring and scaling procedures will be completed in time to allow use of data from the 2006 assessment for the achievement levels-setting process.

In summary, the procurement is to design and implement a procedure to recommend Basic, Proficient, and Advanced achievement levels for the 2006 NAEP in economics for grade 12.  Recommendations based on two outcomes of the process are required:  cut scores to represent the achievement levels on the score scale and items to illustrate performance of students with respect to the achievement levels.

The period of performance will be at least 12 months:  approximately July 3, 2006 - July 2, 2007. All requests for the proposal (RFP) shall reference the RFP number above.  The anticipated release date of this RFP is on or about April 7, 2006.  Telephone requests should be placed by calling (202) 357-0392 or (202) 357-6938.  Fax requests may be sent to (202) 357-6945.  Written requests should be sent to the attention of Stephen Swearingen at the address shown above as the Contracting Office Address.

On or about April 7, 2006, the RFP and SOW, minus attachments, which are not available electronically, will be uploaded to FedBizOpps.  On the same date, the SOW, minus attachments, will be available on the NAGB website http://www.nagb.org.

In response to telephone, fax, or written requests, NAGB will send copies of the RFP by regular U.S. Postal Service mail on or after April 7, 2006.  Copies may be picked up at the Contracting Office Address on or after the release date.

<DESC>The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is issuing a synopsis for a commercial item procurement that will be competed under FAR Part 12.  This is a full and open competition.  This procurement is mission critical, and it is CBP’s goal to solicit and make award to as many qualified vendors as possible to achieve mission success.  A best value determination will be made based on past performance, technical, and price.  An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Multiple Award contract with a base year and four one-year option periods is anticipated for this acquisition.  Multiple awards will be made for each Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) under the contract, therefore, vendors may propose on one or more CLINs in the Request for Proposals.  HOWEVER, THIS NOTICE IS NOT BEING POSTED AS A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP).  THIS NOTICE IS ONLY A SYNOPSIS FOR A FUTURE CBP REQUIREMENT.  The RFP for this procurement will be released on or about January 19, 2006.  The Government will entertain questions from vendors for a short period of time after the RFP is released.  This Q&A period will be posted in the RFP.  The total solicitation time (which includes the Q&A period, the Government’s Responses to Vendor Questions, and the submission of proposals from vendors) for this requirement will last approximately 12 calendar days.  Potential offerors should ensure that they are registered in CCR updating all information that is not current.  

THE REQUIREMENT:  CBP currently maintains two canine facilities to assist it in achieving mission success.  These facilities are:  1) The Canine Enforcement Training Center (CETC) in Front Royal, Virginia, and 2) The National Canine Facility (NCF) in El Paso, Texas.  This synopsis is being posted to notify all qualified vendors under the aforementioned NAICS code of the Bureau’s requirement for untrained canines.  Canines are needed for various reasons, ranging from CBP officer training classes to canine replacement due to injury, disease, etc. in the field.  With the anticipated contract vehicle, CBP will be able to acquire canines as the need arises.  The canines that will be procured under the contract will be examined and trained at both of the CBP facilities mentioned above, however, before Government acceptance, CBP will require that each canine pass a medical examination and a series of tests.  These will be explained in detail in the RFP.  Specifically, the Government requires one of the following breeds in meeting its requirement:  Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Dutch Shepherd, and Belgian Malinois.  The vendor will be required to provide canines of one of these breeds that also meets the following requirements:  1)  Lineage – canines that are European born or that are of European lineage traceable by two generations are preferred in this requirement, yet not required; 2)  Age – the canine shall have a documented age between 12 and 38 months; 3)  Weight – the canine shall weigh no less than 45 pounds and no more than ninety pounds; 4)  Size – the canine shall measure no less than 22 inches and no more than 30 inches at the shoulder; 5) Sex – the canine may be either male or female.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to award a single-award Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for technical assistance in logistics and commodity security, with the strategic objective to increase the availability of essential health supplies in public and private services.  The Government will issue task orders that are either Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price. This award will be issued through Full and Open Competition to acquire the services of a qualified U.S. organization.

The purpose of this contract is to design, develop, strengthen and, upon request, operate safe, reliable, and sustainable supply systems that provide a range of affordable, quality essential health commodities including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and supplies to clients in USAID country programs. USAID field missions indicate a strong desire for technical support that strengthens all aspects of in-country supply chains, including forecasting, procurement, distribution, management information systems, quality assurance, storage and infrastructure, and medical waste disposal.  While family planning and reproductive health remain a priority in the field and for this contract, field missions are also seeking supply chain systems that are designed to handle a range of health products, including contraceptives and condoms, essential drugs, and select commodities for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, and infectious diseases.  This contract will seek to strengthen supply systems for all essential health commodities and create environments (commitment, policies, resources, etc.) that are conducive to their sustainability.  The contract will also collaborate with regional and global partners to support awareness raising and advocacy for commodity security, and explore new approaches to technical areas that include financing, procurement, market development and information systems.  Furthermore, the contract will provide on-going support to USAID’s Central Contraceptive Procurement (CCP) system, including the maintenance of a management information system (MIS).  The countries serviced presently number 45, with field offices in 21 of these countries.

The contractor may also be asked to purchase large quantities of various types of contraceptives, condoms, and possibly other essential health supplies for USAID’s worldwide programs. These commodities are currently being purchased by USAID but this task may be delegated to this contract.

The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract for the prime contractor is 000.  The authorized geographic code for subcontractors is 935.

Performance under this contract shall be from September 30, 2006 through September 30, 2011. 

The RFP is expected to be issued in early April 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration. The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<DESC>POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE SOLICITATION AND ANY AMENDMENTS.  This acquisition has been designated as a 100% SET-ASIDE FOR HUBZone SMALL BUSINESSES.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561110 with a size standard of $6.5 million.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Grants Administration (OGA) seeks a Contractor to provide support for the operation of the Documents Management Center (DMC) formerly known as the Records Management Center (RMC).  The DMC is a secure facility that holds all of the grant files, monitors their location when in use, and is a key unit that assists NCI/OGA in achieving its goals and objectives.  As NCI/OGA moves away from a paper-based grant file system to an electronic-based grant file system, DMC creates, verifies, monitors, and updates NCI’s electronic grants management system known as eGrants.  DMC is the NCI receipt point for all NCI grant applications that are first received by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  DMC also scans paper-based grants documents into eGrants and provides quality control to assure that the document images are accurate and readable.  In cases where DMC receives an electronic version and a paper version of the same grant application, DMC compares the two documents to verify that they are exactly the same.  DMC reviews all grant documents, especially grant applications, for missing, incorrect, outdated, and/or inconsistent information prior to award preparation by the OGA grants management specialist.  Grant application deficiencies are tracked and logged to generate deficiency letters which are sent to grantees so that they can provide the necessary information.  Grant application deficiencies are also tracked for future reference and retrieval and for making grant deficiency reports.  As grantees provide requested information, DMC logs their arrival, enters the information into the grant file folder, and notifies the assigned OGA grants management specialist as to the status and/or completeness of the grant file folder.  DMC monitors and tracks the contents and whereabouts of OGA’s grant file folders.  DMC adds correspondence and other relevant documents to the appropriate grant file folder (whether it is a paper file folder or an electronic file folder).  DMC delivers and retrieves grant file folders to and from OGA staff at their request.  DMC takes special care in delivering, retrieving, and reshelving grant file folders in a timely and accurate manner.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will contain the full Statement of Work (SOW).  A similar system shall be developed for contracts for the NCI’s Office of Acquisitions (OA) under this project.  The successful offeror shall demonstrate an understanding of the operational and electronic environment in which NCI/OGA operates, an expertise in performing the tasks specified in the SOW and an ability to adapt to new technology, requirements and methods.  The RFP will include Mandatory Qualification Criteria which must be met in order for an offeror’s proposal to be considered for award.   

Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N02-CO-71000-64 will be available on or about April 5, 2006 and receipt of proposals will be due on or about May 5, 2006.  The RFP will only be available electronically and may be accessed through the National Cancer Institute’s, Office of Acquisitions external website at URL: http://rcb.nci.nih.gov/  Once there, click on Current Requests for Proposals. All information required for the submission of a proposal will be contained in the electronic RFP package. POTENTIAL OFFERORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR DOWNLOADING THEIR OWN COPY OF THE RFP AND ANY AMENDMENTS.  
This solicitation is anticipated to result in one (1) award to an offeror capable of performing all aspects of the work described in the SOW.  The contract type is firm fixed price for a period of twelve (12) months with four (4) one-year options.   NCI plans to make an award on or about October 1, 2006.   All responsible sources my submit a proposal which shall be considered by the government.   This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) seeks white papers describing innovative technology concepts to provide standoff detection or indicators of buried mines, mine lines or minefields from an unmanned air vehicle (UAV). Concepts are required to detect mines buried on the beach and in the surf zone (SZ). The environment includes the beach which can alternate between dry and wet conditions due to tides, and the surf zone which extends from the beach out to a water depth of 5 meters. The targets include buried anti-tank and anti-invasion mines. Concepts may include a single sensor technology or multiple sensor technologies to cover different portions of the environment with fusion of the results and on-board real-time processing of imagery and detections. The effort will include basic concept investigations and experiments leading to the development of hardware for a demonstration of the concepts from a manned aircraft. The intention is to initiate new research efforts in FY 2007 with candidate concepts demonstrated in FY 2009 or earlier.

(3) Preparation of a CATI training manual for telephone interviewers as well as the training of sufficient numbers of interviewers to conduct the CATI surveys; (4) Inputting data from the completed returned mail survey questionnaires through the use of an optical scanning machine that reads each page of the completed surveys and captures responses; 
(5) Preparation of electronic data files to be prepared from the results of the Medicare CAHPS data collection efforts according to specifications provided to the contractor by CMS and the CMS CAHPS Analytic contractor.    
  
This procurement will be set aside for Small Businesses.  It is anticipated that this competition will result in one award.  The period of performance will be a base year plus four (4) one-year options.

<DESC>This is the presolicitation notice for the Advanced Missile Propulsion Technology (AMPT) program. The solicitation will be released on or about the week 0f 19 Dec 2005 and close on or about 18 February 2005 Jan 2006. The scope of this program is to provide the products, services, and development required to support Advanced Missile Propulsion Technology (AMPT). The Advanced Missile Propulsion Technology program will sponsor new technology developments and demonstrations for solid rocket propulsion.  The desired technologies span all areas of application for solid rocket motors (SRMs), including ballistic and space boost, post boost propulsion and tactical motors.  The development activities to be undertaken will also include advanced technologies for predicting and monitoring the remaining service life of solid rocket motors as well as for the modeling and simulation functions to design and assess the performance of solid rocket motors. Research areas 1 through 5 are Applied Research or Advanced Research Technology efforts.  Proposed work under research areas 1 through 5 must address the technology developments required to achieve Phase III IHPRPT and Phase II TSSS goals.  The overarching strategy of this BAA involves the use of a 5-year open-ended solicitation spanning six (6) research areas.  The current solicitation is a call for the first 5 research areas of the BAA. The intent is to eventually award at least two (2) Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order contracts encompassing all of the first 5 research areas. The period of performance will be 5 years. All responses to the current call for proposals relative to IDIQ contracts covering Research Areas 1 through 5 must include qualifications for the contractor’s capabilities in all five research areas.  The government is not seeking proposals for capabilities in one, some, or most research areas, but for all five. The contract proposals will be evaluated utilizing the Peer Review Process, in accordance with FAR 6.102-(d)(2). Each proposal will be evaluated for technical capabilities; specialized experience, education, and training; previous relevant technical performance; and management strategy and capabilities. Each selected proposal resulting from this initial call will result in the award of an IDIQ contract.  Each IDIQ contract shall provide a minimum guaranteed amount of $250,000.00 of work to be accomplished under that contract during the lifetime of the contract. All work will be defined in individual Task Orders issued under the various IDIQ contracts.  This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  It has been determined that limitation of foreign participation is appropriate. Foreign owned, foreign governments, or foreign nationals are prohibited from participation as a prime or sub-contractor in this effort.  In addition, the Export – Controlled Data Restrictions clause AFMC FAR 5352.227-9000, and Visit Request by Foreign-Owned or Controlled Firms clause AFMC FAR 5352.227-9002 shall be included in any resulting contract and flowed down to subcontractors at all tiers. This prohibition does not preclude the contractor or subcontractors from procuring required raw materials from foreign sources, but the foreign source is not permitted to participate in any of the technical development effort awarded under this announcement. This acquisition is full and open competition.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent to negotiate with Cutting Edge Optronics, Inc., 20 Point West Blvd., St. Charles, MO 63301-4430, on an other than full and open competitive basis for the procurement of  Engineering and Technical support services for the Repair & Upgrade of a Nd: YAG Laser System Model SM-2515 currently located at NGST-CEO’s St. Charles, MO facility and 
an upgrade to an additional SM-2515 unit still at the NAVAIR facilities in Patuxent River, Md.  The Naval Air Systems Command has a requirement to repair and upgrade one unit which will consist of replacing the damaged oscillator Nd:YAG slab gain module with a rod based Nd:YAG gain module containing new 
laser diode bars.  The laser systems repetition rate will 
be increased from 500Hz to 700Hz and the system will be re-optimized at that operating level.  
At the time of the purchase, the laser systems were custom designed and built for NAVAIR by Cutting Edge Optronics, Inc., 
a wholly owned subsidiary of Northrop Grumman.  CEO is the developer of the proprietary design and therefore is the sole source capable of providing this engineering support.  As a result, this requirement will be negotiated in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies 
or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>INVITATION FOR BID FOR A FIRM-FIXED PRICE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, NASHVILLE DISTRICT FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE COFFERDAM AT THE CHICKAMAUGA LOCK REPLACEMENT IN HAMILTON COUNTY, CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE.  The Corps of E ngineers (COE), Nashville District, Nashville, TN intends to issue an Invitation for Bid (IFB) for full and open competition under NAICS code 237990 Other Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction.  The small business size standard for this requirement is $ 31 million.  The estimated value of the contract is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.  The contractor shall construct the cofferdam for the Chickamauga Lock replacement (110 ft x 600 ft) riverward of the existing lock and downstream of Chickamauga Dam at Chattanooga, Tennessee.  Plans and specifications for cofferdam construction will be available on or about June 6, 2006.  The contract will include traditional cellular cofferdam construction for the riverward and downstream sides of the structure.  The  landward side, however, will include pre-cast lift-in sections founded on drilled shafts and filled with tremie and cast-in-place concrete.  This lift-in cofferdam wall will be integrated into the permanent landward lock wall during the future lock constr uction contract. This approach is advocated to minimize impacts to navigation traffic at the existing lock and avoid foundation excavation on the landward side of the cofferdam.  The cellular and lift-in cofferdam walls will meet to form a watertight coffe rdam system which will be pumped dry and inspected.  The cofferdam will be constructed on a limestone foundation and include a grout  curtain.  The contract is expected to take approximately 2 ½ years to complete.  All companies submitting must be register ed with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr2000.com or by calling 1-888-227-2423.  Representations and Certifications must be completed electronically via the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) website at h ttp://orca.bpn.gov within the last 12 months.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS 
The downstream fish passage measures of the Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NPCC) Fish and Wildlife Program include flow augmentation and voluntary spill to mitigate for the effects of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) on anadromous and resident fish. The program also includes monitoring and evaluation to assess the progress in accomplishing the biological objectives of the program at a basin-wide level. A Fish Passage Center (FPC) was included in the mainstem program (NPCC 2003).  The primary purpose of the FPC has been to provide technical assistance and information to Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Tribal Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the general public on matters related to juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead passage through the mainstem hydrosystem. 

Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) was selected by the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) to develop and provide a process for responding to requests for technical analysis. The process will incorporate rigorous peer review to ensure the highest standards of data quality and scientific integrity are met for technical products delivered to regional managers and researchers. The peer-reviewed technical analysis products that result will provide information to fisheries managers on matters related to juvenile and adult salmon and steelhead passage through the mainstem hydrosystem, as well as implications for resident fish.

PNNL is seeking to establish a pool of qualified individuals to serve as Technical Analysts and Technical Reviewers. The following is a brief description of the responsibilities for each category:
Technical Analysts:  Individuals are needed to conduct technical analyses relating to fish passage and the operation of the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS). These requests will involve analyses concerning alternative operational scenarios or other management actions and their influence on the passage or survival of juvenile and adult salmon, steelhead, and resident fish. Analyses will require the integration of passage, survival, operational, and environmental information to analyze, summarize and interpret fish passage data, as well as data available from other sources to address basin-wide as well as project-specific fish passage issues
Technical Reviewers:  Individuals are needed to participate in a peer review panel for the products produced in response to technical analysis requests. The peer reviewers would be expected to respond to a written request for review of a technical analysis product. Those reviewers will prepare a report that describes the nature of their review and their findings and conclusions. That report would critique the product on how well it addresses the objectives of the original request and suggest ways to clarify assumptions, findings, or conclusions. The report would also identify oversights, omissions, and inconsistencies. When needed, the report would include comments and recommendations to the analyst for incorporation prior to final approval by reviewers and release of the product to the requestor and the public.

Interested parties that wish to be considered for both roles should indicate the position they prefer, because an individual will not be allowed to serve in both roles.
To be considered for one of these positions, interested parties should email Julie Hughes at Julie.Hughes@pnl.gov. A formal Request for Qualifications package will be transmitted to all respondents.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Ms. Hughes at (509) 372-3943.

<DESC>The Prescott National Forest plans to secure Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple year contracts for professional surveying services as required for administration of National Forest System Lands in Northern Arizona.  The work will primarily involve surveying and marking property boundaries of land within the Prescott National Forest Proclamation Boundary, but may also include projects on the adjacent Kaibab and Coconino National Forests. 
The Forest Service anticipates award of approximately two IDIQ contracts with task orders issued estimated at approximately $5,000.00 to $30,000.00 with an estimated contract maximum of $150,000.00 per contract over the life of the contract.  An Arizona Registered Professional Land Surveyor must be assigned to each task order.  Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyor(s) licensed in the state in of Arizona will be considered.
Tasks include, but are not limited to, identification, monumentation and perpetuation of property corners and controlling corners for land surveys performed to locate property boundaries, boundary line posting and maintenance of previously posted lines. Work may include retracement of Rectangular Surveys of the Public Land Survey System, including section subdivision, as well as retracement of Homestead Entry Surveys and Mineral Surveys that will require the results of survey to be recorded in the public record. The projects may also include right-of-way surveys, topographic surveys, geodetic control, mapping and other incidental work normally associated with the survey profession. A map of the general work area (Northern Arizona) is available for ftp download by contacting rjjackson@fs.fed.us. 
Estimated award date is on or about November 23, 2005.  Individual task orders will be issued against each contract as needed to accomplish the work. Completion time will vary with each individual task order, and may be negotiated. The contracts will not preclude the Forest Service from using its own surveyors, or other surveying firms to perform surveys in the project area. 
Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size and geographic location of firm, specialized technical expertise and other requirements listed.  Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, an estimated two or more firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required, will be chosen for negotiation.  Selection of firms for negotiation will be made through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualification necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required. 
Firms qualified and interested in providing professional surveying services of the type listed above are hereby invited to submit Standard Form 330, Architect-Engineer and Related Services Questionnaire. 
This is a total small business set-aside.  The North American Industrial Classification Code is 541370 and the small business size standard is $4.0 million.

<CONTACT>Susan Supplee, Contract Specialist, Phone (301) 995-8899, Fax (301) 995-8670, Email susan.supplee@navy.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to provide the following Industry Questions and Government Responses:

1. Question: Does the SCRD have a forecast for the total number of masts required, and over what period of time?

Response: At this time SCRD does not have and cannot forecast for the total number of masts required over what period of time.

2. Question: The specification states that the total weight for the mast can not exceed 750 lbs (280 kgs).  However, 750 lbs is equivalent to 341 kgs, not 280 kgs.  280 kgs is equivalent to 616 lbs.  What is the intended weight limit, 750 lbs or 616 lbs?  

Response: 750lbs (341kg) is correct. 

3. Question: Does the weight limit include the weight of all accessory items (guy stakes, guy ropes, etc etc)? 
 
Response: Weight is specific to the mast only, accessory items not included in that weight factor.

4. Question: The specification calls for an 8-hour deployment time for a 4 man team “depending on type of broadcast antenna system”.  This 8 hour/4 man set up relates to a complete AM broadcast system, including the considerable effort inherent in laying out the ground radials, and in setting up/tuning the antenna tuning unit. Since no information is provided about the broadcast antenna configurations, the 32 man-hour deployment time could be mis-leading.  The mast currently being used by the SCRD for this application is deployable by a 4 man team in only one hour, assuming a single TV or FM broadcast antenna is supported.

Response: The technical point of contact agrees with these statements.  SCRD was only looking at a threshold set up time number.

5. Question: The specified temperature limit for operation is 0-50 degrees C.  However, taken literally, this would mean that the mast would not be required to operate at temperatures below freezing.  What is the actual operating low temperature required?

Response: Even though the 0-50C temperature comes from specifications on current mast, it would be necessary for the mast to be functional in temperatures down to -25 degrees F.


Please submit any questions regarding this synopsis to Susan Supplee via e-mail to susan.supplee@navy.mil. The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided, and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this sources sought.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission to Serbia and Montenegro under the authority of AID Acquisition Regulation (AIDAR) 706.302-70, Impairment of Foreign Aid Programs intends to non-competitively extend a contract with Checchi and Company Consulting Inc. by seven months and increase the increase the Level of Effort by 1082 person days to implement the final phase and close out of the Montenegro Judicial System Reform Project (MJSRP). The extension will increase the total estimated cost of the contract by $250,000. A justification and approval for other than full and open competition has been prepared based on AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(5) for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in unacceptable delays to the program. The purpose of extending the contract is to continue implementation of the most critical activities needed to strengthen and improve the Montenegrin judiciary. Specifically, the Contractor will provide technical assistance to: 1) formulate and implement changes in the constitutional and legislative framework necessary to increase the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary; and 2) strengthen the capacity of judges, court staff, and other essential personnel to ensure the sustainability of the work performed under this contract to date through a planned program phase-out. The Contractor will also continue to work on the reform momentum in the judicial area, building upon success and strengthening the capabilities of judges and relevant court administration. USAID believes that Checchi and Company Consulting Inc. is the only practicable contractor to complete the program given that they are currently mobilized in the field with staff and monitoring systems already in place and the existing program was created and implemented based on a model developed by Checchi. Further Checchi has established a collaborative working relationship with the Government of Montenegro through productive and key relationships in the Ministry of Justice, Republic level Court System and Judges that are required for successful completion of program activities. Checchi’s long-term association with Montenegro’s efforts of reforming its judicial system has promoted the development of a strong working relationship between the Government of Montenegro, Checchi and the U.S. Government, and the network Montenegro courts in this sector. Key government and judicial counterparts in Montenegro have strong confidence that Checchi understands the challenges they face and the trust and congenial relationships that have been established with Montenegrin partners are invaluable in terms of accomplishing USAID’s objectives in this sector at this stage of program activities. Placing a new contractor in the field at this late stage would be disruptive and not understood by Montenegrins, particularly at this final phase of the MJSRP. It would take several years for a new contractor to develop the necessary level of partnership with the Government of Montenegro required for successful completion of the MJSRP. It is, therefore, the opinion of USAID that mobilization of a new contract team would result in acceptable delays and undermine the successful implementation of this final phase of USAID assistance to the Government of Montenegro in the judicial sector.  Qualified companies may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, however, submissions received before April 7, 2006 will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT
Council for Excellence in Government
U.S. Army CP-14 Senior Leadership Development Program (05BA3LS622)

Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) SubPart 6.3 Other than Full and Open Competition exception FAR [6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements], the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) intends to award a sole source purchase order to the Council for Excellence in Government for design and delivery of a five day (four night) Washington, D.C.-area Strategic Leadership Seminar in support of the U.S. Army CP-14 Senior Leadership Development Program (05BA3LS622) during the performance period of March 24 – 28, 2006.  The services required are for a Strategic Leadership Seminar that focuses on competencies critical to strategic leadership: vision, external awareness, strategic thinking, political savvy, and collaboration/partnering.  The seminar will be conducted as a modified simulation, in which candidates will focus on strategic leadership in regard to a significant public policy issue.  The seminar will include a mix of readings, lecture, discussion, and experiential activities, drawing upon experts in the fields of government, public policy, and strategic leadership.  

The Council for Excellence in Government is uniquely positioned to provide the required services because it is a community of leaders who are committed to improving the performance of government and the revitalization of our democracy.  Members of the Council are business, education and nonprofit leaders who have served in government and are united by a strong commitment to encouraging innovation and results oriented performance in government.  Their public and private experience and collective profile distinguish the Council as the only organization that can bring experience-based, cross sector responses to the challenges of sustained high performance in government.

The key focus area of the Council is support for agencies in their pursuit of higher quality, more efficient government performance. The Council seeks to help agencies transform the phrase “managing for results” from sound-bite theory to active reality. While many agencies support performance improvement in private sector organizations, and several partisan foundations regularly prepare “government improvement plans” based on political ideology, the Council for Excellence in Government is engages in non-partisan government performance projects to improve agency performance. Virtually everything the Council does in all its program areas relates in some way to the mission of improving government performance. The Government Performance Projects Team advises other Council groups on aspects of government and helps inform their work. The Council recently prepared a brief overview of the current status of the major Administration initiatives in government performance enhancement: the Government Performance and Results Act, the President’s Management Agenda, and that Agenda’s Budget and Performance Integration and Program Assessment Rating Tool titled “Performance-Informed Managing and Budgeting for Federal Agencies: An Update.”  This and similar efforts substantiate the primacy of the Council for Excellence in Government in non-partisan public sector performance improvement activities.
Sole Source Contracting with the Council

A source contract is the primary vehicle between the Council and federal agencies. Part 6, subpart 6.3 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) grants the authority for sole source contracts if they meet certain conditions. Subpart 6.3 cites 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (3) the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act and 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) as the authority to contract without providing for full and open competition. 

Outlined below are the primary sections and the conditions of the FAR that grant sole source status to an organization like the Council: 

•	Part 6, subpart 6.3 – Other Than Full and Open Competition
“Prescribes policies and procedures, and identifies the statutory authorities, for contracting without providing for full and open competition.”
 
Several conditions (together or individually) have been used by agencies to enter into sole source contracts with the Council:

1)	6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other suppliers or services will satisfy agency requirements
&#61607;	Only one source that can supply the particular supplies or service an agency seeks.
Contracts, for instance, have made reference to our ability to bring together former government officials (Principals of the Council), graduates of our Leadership programs in government (Senior Fellows), and corporate best practices across a wide diversity of private sector firms (Corporate Partners) in a neutral, non-partisan environment.
2)	6.302-2 Unusual and compelling urgency
&#61607;	If the supplies or services needed are such that the Government would be seriously injured if they were not received.
3)	6.302-3 Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services.  
&#61607;	“To establish or maintain an essential engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research and development center.”
4)	6.302-7 Public Interest
&#61607;	The agency head can determine that full and open competition is not in the public interest. 
Background

The Federal Executive Institute wishes to partner with the Council for Excellence in Government to design and deliver a “Strategic Leadership Seminar” as part of the Army’s Senior Leader Development Program.  

The Army’s Senior Leader Development Program is an OPM-managed executive education program.  The overall responsibility for the curriculum for this program rests with the Federal Executive Institute (FEI).  One of the residential courses in the 14-month Army’s Senior Leader Development Program is a Strategic

DS/ATA engages allies around the world to help them increase their own capacity to take strong and decisive action against terrorism within their own borders and control.  It builds productive relationships with counter terrorism partners by collaborating with them to design and implement training programs for host country law enforcement personnel. The program goals are intended to culminate in host countries' eventual independent management and control of their own programs developed with ATA's assistance. As part of these overseas programs,  DS/ATA has an overarching  requirement for overseas logistics support services that include 1) site assessment in country in collaboration with ATA and host country officials, real estate interests, and local commercial entities;  2)  negotiation of site assessment details and decisions;  3) cost estimating and design of  program implementation strategy alternatives in country;  4) project planning for renovation and/or construction of training facilities,  5) project planning for and contracting with local commercial entities for construction of training facility components and long term maintenance of existing facilities;  6) planning, contracting for, and managing long term logistics and security for life support for training instructors and host country trainees;  7) training equipment procurement to support active and future in-country training programs;  8) incidental logistics support such as packing, shipping and transporting program equipment and supplies world wide.

<DESC>The Prescott National Forest plans to secure Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) multiple year contracts for professional surveying services as required for administration of National Forest System Lands in Northern Arizona.  The work will primarily involve surveying and marking property boundaries of land within the Prescott National Forest Proclamation Boundary, but may also include projects on the adjacent Kaibab and Coconino National Forests. 
The Forest Service anticipates award of approximately two IDIQ contracts with task orders issued estimated at approximately $5,000.00 to $30,000.00 with an estimated contract maximum of $150,000.00 per contract over the life of the contract.  An Arizona Registered Professional Land Surveyor must be assigned to each task order.  Only firms with Registered Professional Surveyor(s) licensed in the state in of Arizona will be considered.
Tasks include, but are not limited to, identification, monumentation and perpetuation of property corners and controlling corners for land surveys performed to locate property boundaries, boundary line posting and maintenance of previously posted lines. Work may include retracement of Rectangular Surveys of the Public Land Survey System, including section subdivision, as well as retracement of Homestead Entry Surveys and Mineral Surveys that will require the results of survey to be recorded in the public record. The projects may also include right-of-way surveys, topographic surveys, geodetic control, mapping and other incidental work normally associated with the survey profession. A map of the general work area (Northern Arizona) is available for ftp download by contacting rjjackson@fs.fed.us. 
Estimated award date is on or about November 1, 2005.  Individual task orders will be issued against each contract as needed to accomplish the work. Completion time will vary with each individual task order, and may be negotiated. The contracts will not preclude the Forest Service from using its own surveyors, or other surveying firms to perform surveys in the project area. 
Firms responding to this announcement before the closing date will be considered for selection, subject to any limitations indicated with respect to size and geographic location of firm, specialized technical expertise and other requirements listed.  Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, an estimated two or more firms that are considered to be the most highly qualified to provide the type of services required, will be chosen for negotiation.  Selection of firms for negotiation will be made through an order of preference based on demonstrated competence and qualification necessary for the satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required.

<DESC>THIS IS A DRAFT BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) ONLY.     The Government does not intend to award a contract or any other type of agreement on the basis of this synopsis or to otherwise pay for the information solicited under this synopsis.     This is NOT a request for proposal or an invitation for bid.     The intent of this DRAFT BAA is to obtain market research on the details for the final announcement.     Responses will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this synopsis.     Information will be released in sections.     Therefore, entities who wish to participate in this market research should maintain an awareness of this website.

The Advanced Missile Propulsion Technology (AMPT) program continues to be a vital Department of Defense / National Aeronautics and Space Administration (DoD/NASA) and industry effort.   The Air Force is initiating major efforts to develop new or enhanced technologies in missile propulsion and related inspection systems and service life assessment tools that will lead to the transition of the new technologies into propulsion systems for a prompt global strike capability, a land-based strategic deterrent, and an operationally-responsive space lift system.    

 The technology development efforts to be conducted by any contract awarded through this BAA will be conducted under the guidance of the Integrated High Payoff Rocket Propulsion Technology (IHPRPT) program and the Technology for the Sustainment of Strategic Systems (TSSS) program. Although not mandatory, it is highly recommended that a prospective offeror have either a government coordinated Advance Rocket Propulsion Plan (ARPP), or develop an ARPP prior to or in conjunction with proposal submittal, or have a documented working relationship with a company possessing a government coordinated ARPP to ensure IHPRPT and TSSS relevance of any proposed technology.  In addition, as part of ensuring IHPRPT and TSSS relevance, the offerors will be expected to define quantitatively the proportion of the overall IHPRPT and TSSS goals each component technology will contribute (i.e. the technology objective), how these individual contributions or objectives “roll-up” to assure the achievement of the overall goal, and identify the means by which achievement of the objectives will be measured. Information regarding the IHPRPT and TSSS programs in general and the ARPP process is available at the Air Force Research Laboratory, Edwards AFB, CA.

Legitimate entities capable of receiving ITAR restricted information and interested in participating in this market research should contact Ken Thomason at kenneth.thomason@edwards.af.mil.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is conducting a market survey to determine if there are any eligible and responsible 8(A) firms capable of providing Scientific Program Analyst Support Services to the Division of Extramural Research, for the National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH.  As new avenues of research are opened, additional staff with specific areas of expertise are needed within the DER, to oversee new or expanding programs.  Critical to this effort will be the ability to acquire program analysts with strong scientific backgrounds to compile and analyze data in support of the new initiatives.   

The program analysts provided under this contract will be involved in important research initiatives that will help researchers understand how biological systems function and how knowledge of genomics can be used to diagnose, treat and prevent disease.  In order to provide the required services, the program analysts must have a scientific background in biology and genetics (preferably genomics as well), bioinformatics (if possible), computer skills, and analytic methodology.  In addition, the contractors must possess the following skills:

Skill in data analysis, preparation of spreadsheets and computer applications;

Ability to produce graphical representation of complex data for presentation and use by Program staff;

Ability to adapt and create analytical tools to be used in evaluating data for its relevancy in recommending the issuance or renewal of grants and contracts;

Written and verbal communication skills to interact substantively with staff, scientists, and government officials in order to provide information that affects current and long-range activities of the Institute.  Editing and writing skills and the ability to adapt analytical tools in order to prepare a useful report are essential.

In addition, the program analysts are expected to keep up-to-date in areas of scientific expertise by taking courses and attending meetings on scientific, programmatic, and computer topics.

The contractor will submit resumes of candidates for the scientific program analyst support positions to the NHGRI DER Program Directors.  The Program Directors will have the option of meeting proposed candidates that meet the Government’s requirements before a program analyst is provided under the contract.  

The contractor will provide scientific, technical, administrative, and logistical assistance in support of specific research initiatives.  Examples of current areas of interest include genetic variation, large-scale sequencing, translational research, bioinformatics, and technology development.  

Specifically, the contractor may be asked to perform the following tasks:

Task 5.1 
Request information from and provide e-mail, phone, and written responses to principal investigators, extramural program staff, and others on scientific and programmatic issues.  For example, collect, analyze and develop a presentation of data from grantee progress reports to be used by Program Staff in analysis of progress.  Data collected can be used to project programmatic goals.  

Task 5.2 
Locate scientific, program, and related information on the internet and other means, including literature and database searches.  Genomic information may be available on grantee websites, public databases, or in publications.  Conduct search for material for a specific programmatic need, using a database to search for the material in many cases.  The contractor must have the skills to conduct such a search and the ability to recognize relevant material when found.  

 
Task 5.3
Creatively organize, analyze and write reports in a scientific area as assigned.  Material from a variety of sources, electronic and hardcopy, must be read, interpreted, analyzed and condensed for presentation.  This requires an understanding of biology and genetics in order to recognize the material needed and interpret it in a useful way for presentation to program staff.  

Task 5.4
Assimilate data described above in order to prepare presentation materials such as graphs, slides and overheads. Expertise in using a variety of computer programs is needed as well as the ability to learn new computer programs as needed.  

Task 5.5
Help keep the DER website up-to-date by working with the NHGRI Website programmer.  Effort is needed to edit and rewrite material, communicate that material to those who will post it and ensure that the final posting meets program requirements.

Task 5.6
Participate in numerous meetings such as staff, review, advisory, and scientific program meetings.  Skill is needed in taking adequate and comprehendible notes and providing minutes/reports on these meetings when requested.  

Task 5.7
Assist in logistical planning for various scientific meetings, symposia, lectures and workshops.  Contractor will work with other staff to ensure that details of meeting support are properly handled.  In order to assist or participate at meetings, contractor may be asked to work on weekends or at times other than the normal 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. workday. 

The contractor’s proposal will be evaluated on the following technical criteria: Past performance. This item refers to the contractor’s performance of similar tasks in previous contract efforts.

<SUBJECT>A -- Detection of DNA on Electronic Platforms
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories is actively soliciting industry partners for evaluating an electrical detection technique for DNA via nanowire platforms.  The DNA detection technique is substrate dependent and as such, will require the active participation of the partnering company.  It is expected that this technique will provide greater sensitivity than direct hybridization-adsorption based assays and does not require tagging the target strand.  The interaction would consist of a company providing the nanowire platforms and resulting electrical characterization to test the DNA sensing scheme.  For further information, please respond by mail or fax to at: Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87185-0115. Fax: (505) 844-8011.

DESC: SPECIALIZED AUDIT DATA: The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) intends to issue an order under other than full and open competition to Telcordia, 8 Corporate Place, Piscataway, NJ 08854-4157 for the acquisition of one specialized data product: CLONES (Common Language Online Entry System), for a base year with one option. CLONES is a real-time database that is the repository of CLLI (Common Language Location Identifier) codes.  CLLI codes identify the types, locations, and owners of telecommunications network equipment in the United States. This database is required in order that GAO may provide information on the overall state of facilities-based competition for special access services in the United States. CLONES data is updated on an as needed basis by those telecommunications companies who provide information on the location of their network equipment in CLONES. GAO believes that Telcordia’s CLONES data product described above is not offered by any other vendor; and because of that, GAO avoids a time consuming and substantial process in seeking other similar data which do not exist to GAO’s knowledge.

POC Deja Craddock (202) 512-9078
DESC: SPECIALIZED AUDIT DATA SERVICES: The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) intends to issue an order under other than full and open competition to GeoResults, 309 Pirkle Ferry Road, Suite 300-E Cumming, GA 30040 for the acquisition of specialized data services, for a base year with one option. These services include the processing of data available within Telcordia’s CLONES database and the creation of a market demand analysis for special access services within MSAs (Metropolitan Statistical Areas). GeoResults services regarding the CLONES database include the ability to transform the CLONES data into a geo-coded set of data on the location of fiber-based equipment in commercial real estate throughout the United States. GeoResults has provided similar services to a variety of telecommunications companies (e.g., AT&T, Sprint, BellSouth, Verizon, XO, and Comcast).  Because Telcordia generally limits the distribution of the CLONES database to telecommunications companies, and because that information can be viewed or analyzed only by parties with a current CLONES license, GAO seeks the services of GeoResults because it already possesses such a license. GAO also seeks an analysis of the demand for special access services in the United States.  GAO does not possess data on the locations or demand for special access services within individual commercial real estate buildings in the United States.  GAO seeks the services of GeoResults for this analysis because GAO does not have expertise in the creation of a demand model for special access services in the United States. GeoResults has performed similar analysis for various major telecommunications companies.  GAO also seeks to source the analysis of the CLONES database and the analysis of the demand for special access services to the same company, GeoResults.  GAO believes that GeoResults is the only company that has both a current processing license to the CLONES database and can provide a building-by-building analysis of the demand for special access services in various MSAs. Additionally, GAO believes that it will avoid a time consuming and substantial process in seeking these services from one company, GeoResults, rather than multiple companies. Without a requisite CLONES license, other companies will not be able to provide a simultaneous analysis of the fiber-based equipment in commercial real estate buildings and compare that data in real-time with a market demand for special access services in those buildings.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation document will not be issued. This combined synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-06.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 423490.  The size standard is 100 employees, 100% Small Business set-aside

The Center for Domestic Preparedness has a requirement for M 910 E00 003 - UC AP4C – CHEMICAL AGENT DECTECTOR UNIT / KIT. Items are as follows:  (Brand Name or Equal)
 
The Collective Unit AP4C includes:
-	1 AP4C
-	2 Hydrogen storage devices
-	2 AP4C batteries
-	1 Spare sampling nozzle
-	1 S4PE: Persistent substances sampling system	-	2 S4PE batteries
-	1 Box of 10 sampling scrapers
-	1 S4PE sampling tube for AP4C/TIMs
-	1 Box of 10 test scrapers
-	1 Buzzer
-	1 Technical guide 
The equipment is packaged in a fitted black transport case.
Characteristics 
Intrinsically safe unit for use in explosive atmospheres
Case Size (LxWxH): 460 mm x 380 mm x 170 mm  (18.10” x 7.10” x 4.70”)
Weight of the full case: 6 Kg
Storage temperature: -39°C to +71°C  (-38.2°F to +160°F)
Rain Proof
Decontaminable body/interchangeable wedging
Shock proof and withstands being dropped from 39.4 inches high
It can be used to detect Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and CW agents in the form of vapor or aerosols such as:

Nerve agents for  example (GA, GB, GD, GF, GE, VX, VE, VG, VS)
Blister agents for example (HD, HL, L, PD,  ED, MD)
Blood Agents for example (SA,  AC)
Vomiting agents for example (DA, DM,  DC)
Flammable hydrocarbons for example (Propane,  Acetylene, Ethylene, Methane)
TICs & TIMs for example (Ammonia, Parathion,  Nitroglycerin, Dimethylamine)

The detector is particularly suitable for use in rough conditions: fast turn-on, immediate identification and measurements, single-handed operation, simplicity of use, can be turned off without precautions. 
The detector is a flame spectrophotometer. The air containing the toxic agent is drawn in and heated to a high temperature in a hydrogen burner. This reduces the compound to individual elements which emit rays in their spectral characteristic giving accurate detection and quantification.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR part 12. The request for quote will be in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation: proposals ae being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. 
Purpose of Contract
Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), seeks a vendor to provide the following services:
1.	To provide computer programming expertise leading to the modification of an existing application, named  Tuberculosis Indicators Project (TIP).
2.	To implement additional programming based on necessary enhancements of the TIP application to enable all jurisdictions funded by and report to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  to use this application for monitoring program progress toward national TB objectives. 
3.	To deploy this application and provide technical support and documentation to all users.
 
Background
Accelerating progress toward TB elimination requires new efforts and priorities.  Program evaluation is an essential component of successful programs and a mechanism for TB programs to reach the goal of TB elimination. Survey findings and discussions with state partners identified the evaluation needs of local TB program staff.  In the process, Evaluation Working Group’s (EWG) vision evolved. The vision of EWG, as stated in the Strategic Plan, a document detailing the goals and the action steps of EWG, are: 
-   TB programs routinely conduct self-evaluations and use findings to improve and enhance programs
-   Data systems are in place to collect and organize data for evaluation purposes
-   Standard indicators for program performance are developed and reported to CDC 
-   Evaluation findings are used to make systemic changes
-   Lessons learned from evaluations are shared between programs
 
To address the needs of TB program staff at the state and local levels, and realize the vision of EWG, Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE) EWG is planning and developing a coordinated web-based system that includes 3 major functions in public health programs: (1) program planning, (2) outcome monitoring, and (3) program evaluation. As activities are planned and implemented, outcome indicators are monitored to see how the program is performing.  If a program is doing well or poorly, it can be evaluated to understand why. The knowledge from the evaluation can then be used for planning improvements to enhance the program. These 3 functions operate simultaneously for optimal program performance and success. 
 
Leveraging existing resources and application within the field of Tuberculosis prevention programs, the development of part 2, outcome monitoring component, of the system will be built based on the existing Tuberculosis Indicators Program (TIP).  This application will unify and standardize indicators of program performance reported to CDC. In addition, it will promote the use data currently being collected in Public Health data systems (i.e., Report of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis and Aggregated Report for Program Evaluation) for the purpose of conducting program evaluation and making program improvements.  
The existing TIP system was implemented using a multi-tier architecture using various Off The Shelf (OTS) software.  Listed below is a brief description of the various tiers and the major technologies that were used.
Presentation Tier:  Web based interface for users to request analytical reports using Microsoft Application Service Provider
Reporting Engine: Design of  TIP report templates in Crystal Reports 8.5 based on XML data sources.  The system uses the Report Designer Component (RDC) library to merge the data into the templates and produce a PDF document.  The system extracts data from the Reporting database based on the user’s selection.
Analytical Tier:  Processing of raw data from the Surveillance system into summary data as required by the TIP templates. Also performs necessary data cleansing prior to processing. SAS programs are executed in batch to produce reporting data in the form of ASCII delimited files. The analysis is usually performed by the data managers on their desktops or servers.
Reporting Database Tier: The ASCII delimited files from the above analytical process are imported into the reporting database. The reporting database is Microsoft Access.
The existing TIP system currently provides indicator calculations for TB programs within the state of California. To provide the system for use by TB programs across the United States, the existing TIP system needs to be modified to reflect national indicator calculations if different from the national standarized calculation, accommodate data gathered at the national level from Tuberculosis Information Management System (TIMS) and Tuberculosis Surveillance Program Area Module (TB PAM), and enable reporting jurisdictions to access data within their jurisdiction and perform automatic reporting of indicators for national TB objectives. Data includes, but not limited to, those from Report of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis (RVCT) and Aggregated Report for Program Evaluation (ARPE).   
Access to the TIP system will be granted to perspective vendors for assessment before the submission of the project proposal. 
This statement of work is written to seek the needed computer programming expertise to modify TIP for use by TB programs across the United States.  To successfully and efficiently complete the modification of TIP for national use, this project is divided into 3 phases: (I) System assessment and evaluation, (II) System development and modification, and (III) System deployment and user support.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis / solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested and a written solicitation document will not be issued. This combined synopsis/solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-06.  The NAICS code for this requirement is 423490.  The size standard is 100 employees, 100% Small Business set-aside

The Center for Domestic Preparedness has a requirement for M 910 E00 003 - UC AP4C – CHEMICAL AGENT DECTECTOR UNIT / KIT. Items are as follows:  (Brand Name or Equal)

QUANTITY 2  UNIT EA

The Collective Unit AP4C includes:
-	1 AP4C
-	2 Hydrogen storage devices
-	2 AP4C batteries
-	1 Spare sampling nozzle
-	1 S4PE: Persistent substances sampling system	-	2 S4PE batteries
-	1 Box of 10 sampling scrapers
-	1 S4PE sampling tube for AP4C/TIMs
-	1 Box of 10 test scrapers
-	1 Buzzer
-	1 Technical guide 
The equipment is packaged in a fitted black transport case.
Characteristics 
Intrinsically safe unit for use in explosive atmospheres
Case Size (LxWxH): 460 mm x 380 mm x 170 mm  (18.10” x 7.10” x 4.70”)
Weight of the full case: 6 Kg
Storage temperature: -39°C to +71°C  (-38.2°F to +160°F)
Rain Proof
Decontaminable body/interchangeable wedging
Shock proof and withstands being dropped from 39.4 inches high
It can be used to detect Toxic Industrial Materials (TIMs) and CW agents in the form of vapor or aerosols such as:

Nerve agents for  example (GA, GB, GD, GF, GE, VX, VE, VG, VS)
Blister agents for example (HD, HL, L, PD,  ED, MD)
Blood Agents for example (SA,  AC)
Vomiting agents for example (DA, DM,  DC)
Flammable hydrocarbons for example (Propane,  Acetylene, Ethylene, Methane)
TICs & TIMs for example (Ammonia, Parathion,  Nitroglycerin, Dimethylamine)
Precursors for example (Pinacolyl alcohol,  Methylamine, Triethyl phosphate)
The detector is particularly suitable for use in rough conditions: fast turn-on, immediate identification and measurements, single-handed operation, simplicity of use, can be turned off without precautions. 
The detector is a flame spectrophotometer. The air containing the toxic agent is drawn in and heated to a high temperature in a hydrogen burner. This reduces the compound to individual elements which emit rays in their spectral characteristic giving accurate detection and quantification.

<DESC>Question:  Is the date of 5 August 1996 valid for DDD-F-416E ((In previous solicitations (Attachment 1 A-A-52696) this date was used). Answer:  The specification DDD-F-416E is dated November 27, 1981.  The commercial item description A-A-52696 dated August 5, 1996 has replaced it and was included in the current solicitation as Attachment 1.  Remove the first sentence in its entirety and replace with the following:    "5-foot hoist by 9-foot 6- inch flag in accordance with the Commercial Item Description A-A-52696 was dated 5 August 1996. National Stock Number (NSN) 8345- 00-656-1432 -FLAG, NATIONAL, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, INTERMENT, with the Government specified changes as directed by the DVA". Question: Are there specific packaging requirements?  Does the box need to be printed in color or just white?   Answer:  The commercial item description included as Attachment One to the Request For Quote (RFQ) is commercial item description A-A-52696 dated August 5, 1996 which states that preservation, packaging and marking shall be as specified in the contract or order.  The DVA desires the same packaging as used previously under the preceding federal specification; therefore paragraph 4.1 of Attachment One to the RFQ is changed to read:   "Each flag shall be neatly folded and packaged in a new corrugated cardboard carton of appropriate size and design and of a sufficient strength so that it can be used as a mailing container without additional wrapping or reinforcing.  Cartons shall be secured with gummed paper tape."  The cardboard carton may be of any color.  Currently, flags are shipped six to a carton in cardboard cartons. Question:  Is there a standard form 1449 for this RFQ? Answer:  No, the RFQ was issued as a combined synopsis/solicitation under FAR 12.603(b).   Question: What is the format for the quote? Answer: Please see the instructions in the RFQ. Question: If a company is both a "HubZone" and a "Small Business Concern" how is that indicated on the quote?   Answer:  All offerors should clearly indicate IN THE COVER LETTER the socioeconomic categories for which they wish to be concerned.  All relevant information required on the representations and certifications must be completed.  The business categories for which the Quoter desires to be considered must be specified in its quote. FAR 52.212-3 which has been incorporated by reference, requires that the Quoter certify their business size and socioeconomic status.   Quoters must complete the annual representations and certifications electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov . Quoters must complete the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) in the CCR database in accordance with FAR 52.212-5, also incorporated by reference in the RFQ. Quoters may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757. Question: Is a sample required if the company is a current supplier?  Answer:  The RFQ states: "Technical Quote-the quoter, unless currently providing the flags to the DVA, shall include a bid sample (one flag) conforming to the specification for the interment flag." Vendors who may have supplied flags as subcontractors to any of the current suppliers of interment flags to the DVA must still submit bid samples if providing a quote as the prime contractor.  Question: When does the Government plan on making the awards? Answer: The Government intends to make awards on or about May 2006. Question: Why was the date for the RFQ extended if new bid specifications and bid documents will be required? When will these be ready? Answer: The revised commercial item description will be released upon completion of technical review.  All Offerors will be notified at the same time via a posted amendment to the RFQ.    Questions Questions are due in writing to the contract specialist, Frank Flutter via email (frank.flutter@VA.gov), no later than 4:30 PM local time on March 31, 2006.
