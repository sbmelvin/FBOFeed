This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware. It is needed in support of MDAýs mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight. The Missile Defense Agencyýs mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats. Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system. Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology. IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet ý a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test. No other software exists that affords the capability. Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDAýs program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture. Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agencyýs requirements because of equipment requirements.

The Healy is currently home ported in Seattle, WA. The maintenance support contractor shall be required to maintain a quality program that complies with ISO-9001.  The technical consultant must have at least 3 years hands-on experience in the troubleshooting, repair and performance of preventative and corrective maintenance on equipment of similar size and service to the Converteam equipment currently installed on the USCGC HEALY.  The Coast Guard anticipates a one-year contract with options to extend the contract not to exceed six additional years.  It is the Government's belief that only Converteam, the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)/Integrator, can provide the support required.  The Government does not own the technical documentation or software code needed to conduct a competitive procurement.   However, other responsible sources having the expertise and required capabilities are encouraged to identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement within 15 days from the publication of this synopsis.  Interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience relevant to fulfilling the above requirement.  Capability statements shall include evidence of at least five years experience/work on Converteam control systems with features/capability comparable to the system to be supported.  This experience may be in system design, operation, maintenance, and training or in any combination of these four specialties.  They must be intimately familiar with all components of the HEALY systems list and their function.  Interested parties must provide proof of access to Converteam proprietary technical documentation on systems hardware and software.  Only partial technical documentation/data is available to the Government.  Access to Converteam documentation is required to enable tailoring/upgrade of MPCMS, DPS software and/or hardware and replacement of technologically obsolescent power plant components to meet future CG requirements.  Parties must also demonstrate the capability of accessing the ship's MPCMS/CTES from a remote shore site and extracting data from MPCMS/CTES databases for analysis and troubleshooting.  In the absence of responses for firms, which believe they have the capability to perform this requirement, the Coast Guard intends to negotiate with Converteam Inc. for the work described pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(b)(1).  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, which will be considered by the agency.  No other notice will be published until award is made.  Address all correspondence to: USCG, NESU  Seattle, Attn: G. M. Wing, 1519 Alaskan Way S Bldg 3, Seattle, WA  98034.  See Numbered Note 22.

THE INTENDED USE OF MATERIAL OR SERVICE                Design Engineering has chosen 80/20 T-Slotted Aluminum Extrusion to construct a Prototype F/A-18 Inner Wing Multi-use Transport Dolly.  80/20 (The Industrial Erector Set) T-Slotted Aluminum Extrusions and a large verity of fasteners and joining hardware are commercially available to anyone who wants it. This 8020 bolted modular framing system is ideally suited for the design requirements of this transport dolly.      The dolly will be used for intermediate wing spar repair.  The dolly must be lightweight, rigid and structurally capable of supporting a 1300 lb load.  Dolly joints must be adjustable to accommodate different height and length requirements of wing support details.  The bolted construction will eliminate the problem of welded (thin walled) aluminum joints witch generally crack from vibration during normal use.  The bolted construction will also allow the required adjustability of wing attach/support details. This is a PROTOTYPE design and is getting its share of visibility due to the urgent need to supply wings to the fleet.  Because of the urgency, a Sole Source solution to developing the prototype dolly may result in a faster turnaround time and the least cost to the government.  The manufacture chosen to fabricate the prototype dolly must be in close proximity to the depot to accommodate design changes, fit checks and first article validation.  The aircraft component (Inner Wing) must remain at the depot, so the manufacture must be in the San Diego area to expedite the aforementioned changes/checks.  F & L Industrial Solutions, Inc., is a local distributor of 80/20 products and has done some fabrication of work stands/platforms for the depot in the past.  They meet all the requirements of a local company that is familiar with 80/20 products.  That said! There is no preference for this company, any local manufacturing company familiar with 80/20 products is satisfactory.    1.	THE CRITICAL OR UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MATERIAL OR SERVICE WHICH ARE MANDATORY FOR THE INTENDED USE: ?	Lightweight material capable of supporting high loading   ?	Bolted construction to eliminate welding ?	Adjust Joints to accommodates height/length changes  ?	Material will support long length without supporting structure ?	Ease of fabrication  ?	Material is easily reconfigured to accommodate design changes MULTIUSE ROLLOVER PER DRAWING #E97372 . PROTOTYPE COMPANY TO FIT DOLLY INTO WING BEFORE  DELIVERED. 80/20 EXTRUSION USED FOR FRAME. RESPECTIVE  BIDDER HAS TO BE FAMILAR WITH "80/20 INC".  PRODUCTS.

<DESC>This synopsis is being provided to publish a requirement for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Sustainable Technologies Division?s (STD) in Cincinnati, Ohio for the delivery of a complete rainfall infiltrometer system incorporating a programmable rainfall simulator and infiltrometer unit to characterize landscape hydrology and runoff potential in field studies. In general, the rainfall infiltrometer system (rainfall simulator and controller, infiltrometer unit) should meet all of the following system specifications.  These unique capabilities are essential for EPA, NRMRL?s STD compatibility requirements for hydrologic measurements, standards for accuracy, capability, and productivity.   Without a rainfall infiltometer system with the below mentioned requirements, US EPA, NRMRL, STD cannot perform mission-critical hydrologic measurements.  Sampling area: Spatial extent of sampling area no less than one-square meter. Sampling area should be enclosed with a tent-like covering over a lightweight metal frame so as to eliminate the effects of breezes or wind upon rainfall distribution. Rainfall simulation: Rainfall intensity and amount must be freely programmable in the range of 15 to 150 mm per hour (up to 10 shifts within a rainfall event, each with programmable durations of 0 to 99 minutes each), with an effective spray head sweep of 135 degrees and a full range of sweep between 0 and 360 degrees for special applications. Maximum flow rate is specified at 545 litres per hour and at a minimum pressure of 1 bar. Controller details and features: Rainfall controller should have power port to provide at least 12 volts at 2A to control external sensors or relays. Infiltrometer system:  This is a very straightforward unit consisting of a water collection frame (1 square meter), reservoir with float or depth (level) sensor, water-level recorder (strip chart) or interface for level sensor, and a discharge pump. An equivalent system might, for example, alternatively employ a level sensor or other means to directly measure runoff depth in the reservoir, with a sensor interface output to a ordinary laptop or portable computer. Power supply: Any individual sub-component of the system will run on 12V DC The North American Industry Classification Code is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  A written solicitation, PR-CI-08-10158, is anticipated to be issued the week of December 17, 2007.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued as a request for quotes (RFQ).  All responsible businesses may submit a quotation in response to the solicitation which shall be considered by the Agency.  This procurement will be pursued using FAR Part 12 Commercial Acquisition methods and procedures. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  In addition to price, the following factors may be used to evaluate the offeror's technical proposal: technical specifications/performance, and past performance.  Contract type is anticipated to be firm fixed price.

<SUBJECT>A--Development of Fully Integrated Mercury Model (MERGANSER) for New England States.
<SOLNBR>PR-NC-08-10027
<RESPDATE>122207
<ARCHDATE>01212008
<CONTACT>JOHN M. SOUTHERLAND, Contract Specialist, Phone: (919) 541-3416, E-Mail: southerland.john@epa.gov
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a requirement for the Development of Fully Integrated Mercury Model for New England States.  EPA believes that the Northeast States for coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM) is the only source qualified to perform this effort.  This requirement is to complete work to develop a regression-based mercury model for New England in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) environment.  The (Mercury Geo-spatial Assessments for the New England Region - MERGANSER) model will integrate recent atmospheric mercury-deposition models with many databases on mercury sources, mercury levels in fish and bird tissue, and ecosystem features that may be associated with risk of mercury contamination on biota and, ultimately, humans.  Under this contract, the contractor will ensure that the mercury emissions inventory for the New England states is accurate, model wet and dry air deposition of mercury, identify the most appropriate air-deposition models to use for MERGANSER, provide inputs to the High Resolution Deposition Model, and complete the biota and watershed components of the model as well as integration of other model elements.  NESCAUM is a regional organization that represents the interests of co-regulators and co-implementors in the execution of national/regional environmental programs related to air pollution control planning and air resources management under the Clean Air Act for eight northeast states, six of which are New England states; i.e., Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.  For the past five years, NESCAUM has been involved in laying the groundwork for the development of MERGANSER for the New England states.   Specifically, they have refined mercury emissions inventory for input to atmospheric-deposition modeling, used emission inventory data for the northeast region to develop inputs for REMSAD air-deposition model, and estimated total mercury deposition for New England.   As a result, NESCAUM is considered uniquely qualified to complete the MERGANSER project, and have all of the data, knowledge, and scientific expertise to complete this effort in a timely and efficient manner.  It is not believed that any other contractor has the required knowledge and expertise and would, in fact, take several years to obtain the required level of knowledge and expertise at which point the data would be out of date.  In addition, NESCAUM has established relationships with each of the environmental organizations within the six New England states to ensure that the requirements of each state are adequately addressed and the resources within each state are effectively utilized.  This is critical to the success of this effort.  If any firm believes that they have the required knowledge and expertise to accomplish this effort, they should submit a response to the above address within thirty (15) days of this notice.  The response should include specific information on the firms expertise and knowledge of the proposed effort by addressing the following criteria:  1) Demonstrated knowledge of mercury air emission source inventories in the Northeast from 1998 to present; 2) Ability to provide estimates of mercury wet and dry deposition based upon the mercury emission inventories; 3) Ability to provide seasonal and annual estimates of wet and dry deposition for a 100 meter grid for the six New England States to be incorporated into the High Resolution Deposition Model (HDRM); 4) Ability to build a multi-variate model taking into consideration environmental variables that are linked to predict mercury levels in fish tissue, using a yellow perch equivalent, for lakes throughout New England; and 5) Ability to develop an empirical linkage between mercury levels in fish and in fish-eating birds.   Offerors considered qualified to perform this effort should also have experience in coordinating and working with the six New England states to represent their interests as co-regulators and co-implementors in the execution of regional environmental air pollution programs.  All responses received will be evaluated against the above provided criteria. NAICS Code 541620 applies with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other sources(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.  Consequently, any response failing to provide the aforementioned specific information and instead choosing to merely submit a routine letter requesting a copy of the RFQ will be ignored.  Interested parties who can meet the above requirements may submit written qualification statements, fully explaining their capability no later than 15 days after the date of this publication.  Submit response to the U.S. EPA, Attn: John Southerland Jr (MC-E105-02), RTP Procurement Operations Division, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711

<ARCHDATE>01212008
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Helen Britz, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-9633
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541380   Contracting Office Address:  Environmental Protection Agency, Headquarters Procurement Operations Division, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20460 NAICS Code: 541380 - Testing Laboratories with a Small Business Administration (SBA) size standard of $11  million dollars. The US EPA/Office of Air and Radiation under the authority of the FAR Part 13 -- Simplified Acquisition Procedures and FAR 6.301-1 -- Only One Responsible Source, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, TX, for engine  compliance testing.  BACKGROUND:  Under Title II of the Clean Air Act (42 USC 7521 et seq.; the Act), engine manufacturers may not legally introduce their products into commerce until EPA has certified that their engines comply with applicable standards.  To obtain such certification, engine  manufacturers are required to submit descriptions of their planned production engines and test data showing compliance with applicable standards.  EPA evaluates the data and, if it is satisfactory, issues a Certificate of Conformity.   The Act also authorizes EPA to verify that:  (1) test data  presented in the certification application was correct and in fact represents the emissions profile of mass produced engines (confirmatory testing);  (2) test procedures employed by manufacturers are valid and in compliance with applicable regulations (Selective Enforcement Audits or SEAs); and (3)  engines comply with emission standards throughout their useful lives (in-use testing).  From time to time, when concerns arise about a particular manufacturer or engine family, EPA must also test engines as part of compliance investigations. These requirements apply to all categories of on-highway  and non-road engines regulated by EPA. The penalties for noncompliance can be steep and have serious impact on a manufacturer; therefore, testing used for compliance purposes must be precise and faithful to applicable regulations.  For example, if an engine family is found in noncompliance, the  certificate of conformity can be voided ab initio and the manufacturer can be fined up to $32,500 per engine sold under that certificate.    The Certification and Innovative Strategies Division (CISD) of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) implements the regulations pertaining to  the compliance of on-highway and nonroad engines. SCOPE/OBJECTIVE:  The objective of this requirement is to provide the Heavy-Duty and Nonroad Engines Group (HDNEG) of CISD with flexible testing and analytical support to ensure manufacturer compliance with emission regulations, as described above.   Since compliance investigations occur when there is reason to believe that a problem exists, advance notice of testing may not be provided.  CISD needs the ability to respond quickly to a tip or the findings of a compliance official.  This requirement focuses on the following categories of  engines: Table A: Regulated engines that could be tested under this requirement Engine Category/Regulations On-highway engines/40 CFR Part 86 Non-road engines: -Spark-ignition engines under 19 kW; all classes (I-V), both handheld and non-handheld/40 CFR Part 90 -Spark-ignition engines above 19  kW/40 CFR Part 1048 -Compression-ignition engines/40 CFR Part 89 and 1039 -Marine Spark-ignition engines/40 CFR Part 91 -Marine Compression-ignition engines/40 CFR Part 94 -Locomotives/40 CFR Part 92 -Recreational Vehicles/40 CFR Part 1051 Other regulations, such as Parts 1065 and 1068, may apply  to one or more category of engines.   Although the majority of engines certified today run on either gasoline or diesel, some engine families have been certified with other fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) or compressed natural gas (CNG).  Compliance testing may be needed using the  fuels used by the manufacturer during certification testing. Compliance testing may require accumulation of engine hours for break-in prior to emissions measurement.  Such service accumulation shall be performed according to regulatory requirements, manufacturer specifications or EPA instruction.   Engine hour accumulation may also be necessary to evaluate engine durability. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:  For the reasons mentioned, the contractor must have a thorough knowledge of the regulations, established expertise, and reliable and well-calibrated instruments.  Since CISD may need testing of any  engines category in short notice, the contractor must have the capability to test and age all of the engine categories mentioned in Table A, paying particular attention to the different test cycles used in certification. The contractor must provide all personnel, materials, services and facilities  required to perform work in response to written assignments issued by the Contracting Officer involving one or more of the engine categories and compliance programs listed.  Each work order will provide any necessary background and technical information (such as a description of the test  engine/engine family, regulations under which the engine is to be tested, testing parameters, testing fuel, etc.), a delivery schedule and any other pertinent information. The contractor shall maintain confidentiality before and after all investigations. DESCRIPTION OF WORK:  At the request of  CISD, the contractor will receive and test an engine or group of engines often on a short turnaround basis, which may run from one to six weeks.  The contractor will use the test procedures and specifications defined in the regulations applicable to that category of engine (as well as test for the  pollutants regulated in that category).  CISD may provide additional instructions at the time of the test order, depending on the objectives of the test.  The contractor may be required to accumulate hours before testing, either in-house or through other means, on the test engine.  In every  Technical Direction, CISD will provide instructions on how to obtain and/or dispose of the test engine.  Test engines may be shipped to the contractor by the engine manufacturer, an owner or by EPA.  In some instances, EPA may request that the contractor buy the engine.  Disposal of the test engine  could include shipping it to EPA or back to the manufacturer or owner, or simply making arrangements for the manufacturer/owner to pick it up. For the reasons described previously, CISD is not always able to plan the kind of testing it requires as potential compliance issues are often discovered  unexpectedly.  Therefore, the contractor needs to be prepared to test any of the categories of engines under CISD's purview, as listed in Table A.  The contractor may also be required to work on several engines concurrently.  However, for short-term planning purposes, CISD expects to start testing  mainly small spark-ignition engines under 40 CFR Part 90 and small compression-ignition engines under 40 CFR Part 89 and 1039. The contractor must also have available either in-house or through other means, sufficient engineering and technical capability to perform any necessary maintenance  (including diagnostics and repairs) on the test engines and ascertain the reasons for failures, is such a case arises. DELIVERABLES: For each test, the contractor shall deliver a report containing the data gathered during testing and an analysis of such data, as provided by the regulations as  requested in the work assignment.  The analysis should be pertinent to the needs of the compliance program under which the test was ordered and conductive to determine whether the engine tested complies with emission regulations.  CISD will provide guidance as needed on the format and content of  each report and may request specific points of analysis, as needed.  Technical accuracy is critical to the performance of this contract. The contractor will keep a log of all testing, aging and maintenance done on every test engine.

<DESC>Under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)1 as set forth in FAR 6.302-1, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences anticipates negotiations with the University of Utah on a non-competitive basis to extend the current contract for an additional six  (06) six months. During the extension period, the contractor will continue to provide support to accomplish the following objectives: 1)  import SNP-discovery data for newly re-sequenced genes from the University of Washington effort (contract N01-ES-15478); 2) import high quality, well validated SNP data relevant to NIEHS-listed ERGs from other publicly available web resources; 3)  convert the data imported from the University of Washington and other publicly available databases to the graphical display developed by the University of Utah; 4)  make newly imported, converted data available to the public through the web-accessible GeneSNPs database; 5) maintain the database to minimize downtime; and 6)  continue with the process already in progress of updating and transferring the database to NIEHS, and ensuring that the database is fully functional once established at NIEHS..  Inherent duplication of costs to the Government, unacceptable delays impacting upon the stated objective, and the necessity to maintain continuity, compatibility, and consistency in the data make competition unfeasible.  See Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><BR>The United States Army CECOM Life Cycle Management Command (CECOM LCMC) intends to award a new work modification to W15P7T-06-C-P437 on a non-competitive basis.  The anticipated award will be made under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and F AR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to BAE Systems Advanced Information Technologies, Inc., Burlington, MA in support of DARPAs ASE program.<BR><BR>The current contract implements DARPAs ASE program by developing a subvocal speech recognition system .  Recent studies at NASA AMES have demonstrated that electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from the neck surface during speech can be used in conjunction with a neural network classified to reliably produce commands for computer and/or machine control.   Because subvocal signals are measured directly from the speech articulatory musculature, they have the potential to provide a new and effective form of communication to those who have lost the ability to speak (such as laryngectomy patients).  The BAE te am includes leading authorities in all relevant aspects of speech:  EMG sensor development and signal processing, acoustics, phonetics, neuromuscular voice control, and speech recognition.  The additional tasking requested will further understanding of the  nature of subvocal speech and in turn use that understanding to develop a subvocal speech recognition system.<BR><BR>The prime contractor, BAE Systems, has acquired extensive experience in the unique aspects of the ASE program that is critical to meet pro gram requirements and performance metrics.  BAE Systems key personnel have exclusive knowledge of the processes, risks and issues associated with the planning, coordination and execution of this program.  Failure to award to BAE will result in program star tup delays, high performance risk and the increase of acquisition costs.<BR><BR>A tracking number W15P7T-08-R-P409 has been assigned to this effort and should be referenced along with the contract number W15P7T-06-C-P437.  Technical questions should be add ressed to Mr. Hector Reyes, email;  hector.reyes1@us.army.mil, phone: 732-427-8039.

The Government believes that Destiny Management Services LLC is the only contractor that can supply the final phase of servi ces consisting of training, developing, conducting, and implementing an effective Management Control Process for the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) headquartered in Silver Spring, MD, and its related OCONUS locations, specifically Kenya and  Thailand (AFRIMS).  Recompeting this requirement and selecting a new contractor would result in a substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agen cys requirement.  This notice is not a request for a competitive quote.  Parties purporting to have the requisite credentials to perform these services must furnish in writing, factual information which clearly supports and demonstrates evidence that anot her source is capable of meeting the Governments requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government.  If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the pur chase will be awarded without further notice.  The Point of Contact (POC) for this action is:  dana.herndon@us.army.mil.

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED REGARDING THE NATIONAL GEOSPATIAL-INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (NGA) NEW CAMPUS EAST (NCE) BASE OPERATIONS SUPPORT ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS. NGA intends to award a competitive unrestricted Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF) contract to a contractor/contractor team with the proven ability to support, operate, maintain and sustain the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, New Campus East,(NGA-NCE), site and facilities, located on the Fort Belvoir Engineering Proving Ground (EPG) in Northern Virginia.

NGA-NCE site is 130+/- acres with a total of approximately 2, 419,000 gross square feet of buildings.  The NGA-NCE is a classified campus that will includes a mix of administrative, training-conferencing centers, computer laboratories and data centers, command center, library and general support areas.   NGA-NCE will accommodate approximately 8,500 employees.  

The successful contractor must demonstrate the ability to manage, plan, and execute all the functions associated with establishing and sustaining a high performing full service base operations support program.  Interested parties are invited to respond to this Presolicitation Notice, which is issued following the procedures described under FAR 15.202 entitled "Advisory multi-step process". The result of this pre-solicitation notice will help determine if sources capable of satisfying the agency's requirements exist. Additionally, it is not the Government's intention to enter into a contract based on this notice or otherwise pay for information solicited. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). This is a pre-solicitation notice for planning purposes only, and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the NGA. NGA will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to the subject of this request for capabilities statements. The projected award date is January 2009.

Please ensure the Request for Capability Statement (RFC) number HM0140-08-R-0002 and program title (NGA-NCE BOSC) is referenced on all correspondence.  Telephone requests for this Presolicitation Notice WILL NOT be honored and no prospective Offerors list shall be maintained.         

ADVISORY MULTI-STEP PROCESS: This advisory multi-step process is divided into two (2) steps. Step 1 consists of the submission of the Contractor Capability Statement, agency evaluation of the capability statement, and subsequent advisory notification to contractors of their likelihood of being a viable competitor. Step 2 consists of the solicitation, conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). This Step will be initiated by issuing a formal RFP in the near future.     
All contractor personnel must have or be capable of getting a TS/SI/TK security clearance with a CI Polygraph. 

STEP 1: SUBMISSION OF CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT, GOVERNMENT EVALUATION AND ADVISORY NOTIFICATION: This step includes submission of the Contractor Capability Statement followed by Government evaluation and advisory notification.  Please note that no questions will be accepted during Step 1. The capability statement Evaluation Criteria are included in this announcement.

A. Submission of Contractor Capability Statement: Interested contractors are invited to submit a Capability Statement describing the information requested in the Contractor Capability Statement Instructions below. Contractor Capability Statements must be submitted electronically to Paula.J.Ireland@nga.mil and Elizabeth.NievesTorres@nga.mil no later than 4:00PM EDST, 21 December 2007. Responding to this requirement will require a significant effort on the part of the contractor to propose to the Government. It will also require a substantial effort on the part of the Government's evaluation team to evaluate an array of different approaches or solutions. It is the Government's intent through the use of the advisory multi-step process to limit the number of contractors that will go through the time, expense, and effort of developing proposals to those that are deemed most qualified. Contractors contemplating competing for this contract award are to make a realistic self-assessment as to whether your organization has the experience and capacity to compete. 

B. Government Evaluations: The Contractor Capability Statement will be evaluated based upon the areas and criteria identified in the Contractor Capability Statement Instructions and Evaluation Criteria section. The Government will complete the Step 1 advisory multi-step process without communicating with the contractors who provide submissions.

C. Advisory Notifications: NGA will issue an advisory notification stating that the respondent, based on the information submitted, is likely or unlikely to be a viable competitor. The Government (NGA) will advise respondents considered not to be viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion. Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, all respondents may participate in the resultant acquisition.

CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT INSTRUCTIONS: 
The Government expects a capability statement only from qualified prime contractors. NGA requests that potential sub-contractors or partners refrain from submitting capability statements.   Firms should respond to the Presolicitation Notice by addressing the topics listed below.         

Page Count: Page size shall be 8.5 by 11 inches. Margins shall be set at one inch on top and bottom and both sides. Minimum type size shall be 12 point Arial standard font with single spacing (not to exceed 46 lines per page). Submissions must be submitted in Microsoft Word 2000 (or newer version). Total page count of the capability statement shall not exceed fifteen (15) pages. 

SUBMISSION FORMAT: The contractor shall submit the capability statement response and information in the order of the topic areas; 1) Corporate History/Overview, 2) Experience, and 3) Technical Capability. All responses shall be addressed in the order listed below.         

1. Corporate History/Overview: Provide a brief description of your company, primary service area, total number of employees, number of personnel cleared at the TS/SI/TK level as a percentage of employees, number of employees available to work this effort based on current workload, and viability in support of the NGA NCE BOS program requirements.

STEP 1 - CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY STATEMENT EVALUATION CRITERIA 
The Government evaluation will focus upon the degree to which the contractor has completed the planning, implementation and execution of efforts of similar size and scope to the NGA BOS efforts. The contractor's capability submission must indicate that it can provide and perform the majority of the NGA BOS planning, implementation and execution (not ancillary tasks) as the Prime contractor. The Contractor Capability Statement will be evaluated based upon the areas identified in the Contractor Capability Statement Instructions and as indicated in the Evaluation Criteria section below.

1) Corporate History/Viability. Evidence of ability to provide an adequate number of cleared personnel at the TS/SI/TK level and demonstrated ability and capability to a BOS of this size and magnitude.

3) Technical Capability: Significant and demonstrated evidence that the contractor can provide and perform the majority of the BOS planning, implementation and execution (not ancillary tasks) as the Prime contractor with a proven track record of success in developing, implementing and executing a deployment plan. 

A one-on-one meeting with only those firms determined to be viable will be conducted for the purpose of gathering information on Acquisition Strategy, Contract Type, and related issues. 

***The list of interested parties WILL NOT be posted and/or updated on a daily basis. An updated list along with a list of viable firms will be posted after the Multi-Step Process is completed and responses evaluated.

<DESC>The National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, intends to resolicit a current contract with the Regents of the University of California to continue the study of disease and disability onset in an old age cohort established in the Health ABC Study.  This is a unique scientific opportunity to take advantage of an established epidemiologic cohort on which extensive data has been obtained.  This opportunity also takes advantage of the research study management infrastructure, such as specialized data entry, quality control, and data management systems developed to support the data collected in the study, already developed in the existing Health ABC Coordinating Center contract (N01-AG-6-2106) with University of California, San Francisco.  The key elements of this project include:  twice yearly phone interviews of functional and cognitive status performed with the same telephone instrument used in the ten years of the study; continued ascertainment of disease and disability endpoints and continued adjudication of cause-of-death; and maintenance of the biorepository.  Authority: 41 U.S.C. 2539(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  Inherent duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition makes competition unfeasible for this resolicitation.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This solicitation requires the production and transmission of notices for the United States Bankruptcy Courts.  The services provided by the Bankruptcy Noticing Center (BNC) program include, but will not be limited to the receipt of bankruptcy case related data in electronic format, production of bankruptcy notices, distribution of notices through the United States Postal Service or by electronic transmission, using the most cost efficient, timely and effective manner, and to provide program related reports to the AO and Bankruptcy Courts.
The contractor shall furnish managerial, administrative and direct labor personnel to accomplish all work under the contract. The process of producing and preparing notices for transmission is accomplished by the Bankruptcy Court staff and other entities, such as contractors, debtors, attorneys and trustees.  Under a contract managed by the AO, the BNC electronically retrieves data from participating courts case management systems and automates the printing, addressing, batching, and mailing process.  Since its inception in 1993, the BNC program has saved the Judiciary over $67 million in noticing costs and has improved service to the Bankruptcy Courts and notice recipients.  The volume of work will be dependent on the number of bankruptcy cases filed and the number of Bankruptcy Courts that use this program.  Presently, all 90 Bankruptcy Courts utilize the BNC with the exception of the Districts of the Virgin Island, Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands.  At this time, it is estimated that the number of notices prepared and served by the Bankruptcy Courts in fiscal year 2007 (October 1, 2006, through September 30, 2007) will be approximately 105 million.   Historical volume information and program cost information will be provided at the time the solicitation is posted.    Currently, the Government has a contract for operating a BNC through September 2008.     
This will be a fixed price, indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract (IDIQ), as well as a performance-based with an award fee.  Anticipated performance is for one base period and nine-one year periods at the option of the Government. The contract does not have a set-aside requirement for small, service-disabled veterans, minority or woman-owned, or other businesses that can be classified under Government procurement set-aside definitions.

Questions & Responses RE: VA-250-08-RQ-0091 for Court Reporting and Transcription Services Questions:	What is the estimate of work under this contract - either in number of depositions or number of pages either monthly or annually? How often is work required under this contract?  Response:	It is anticipated that the services of a court reporter/transcriptionist will be needed approximately 4-6 times per year.  Questions:	Is there currently a contract in place that is expiring? If so, can you advise who the current contract holder is, and the rates of the current contract? How are these services currently being performed? Under contract? In-house? If these requirements are currently being performed under a contract, Who is the Contractor? What is the contract number? When does the contract expire?  What is the current contract value? Response:	There is currently no contract in place and services were previously performed on an "as needed" basis.  Questions:	Will services such as expedited delivery, "dirty disk" (a/k/a unproofread transcripts the same evening), MiniScripts (a/k/a condensed transcripts, ASCII files or WordPerfect files of transcripts, RealTime or Videography be ordered under this contract?  I didn't see a spot to put rates for these items.  Additionally, will the court reporter be handling photocopying of exhibits marked at depositions?  If so, I didn't see a spot for rates for this, either.  Response:	The VA will not accept unencrypted CDs or disks; therefore transcripts can only be submitted in hard copy or e-transcript format. We would like mini transcripts and transcripts emailed in Microsoft Word. At the current time, no video depositions are anticipated. Any exhibits entered at the deposition are handled by the court reporter and made part of the transcript. A quote for the original copy of the transcript should include any exhibits as determined at the time the transcription is taking place.  Questions:	What type of proceedings are they?  Such as hearings, depositions, personal interviews and what is the estimated number of hours per proceeding? Is it EEO hearings and Arbitration hearings or is it transcription of tapes, medical transcription, etc.? Do you have an estimate of the number of days of work each month or the number of reporters that I would need to have available on any given day? Response:	It is anticipated that the services of a court reporter/transcriptionist will be needed for depositions lasting approximately 2-6 hours each and hearings which can last anywhere from half a day to three days.  Question:	What is the turn around time for each job? Such as next day, 3-5 days, 10-12 days? Response:	Turn around time varies and expedited turn around time (e.g. 3-5 days) is sometimes required.  Question:	Other than the original, how many copies typically are provided? Response:	The number of transcripts required could vary anywhere from 1-5 copies.  Question:	How do you evaluate the pricing? Response:	Please see the section of the solicitation that reads 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999). Offers will be evaluated based on the lowest price technically acceptable.  Question:	Can we send in our quotation either by Email or Fax? Response:	Yes.    Question: 	Main differences between old statement of work and the current one or the old contract number, title, award date of when this project was last performed/managed?  Response:	Because there is no contract currently in place, nor has there been one in the past, services were previously performed on an "as needed" basis.

<DESC>The Army & Air Force Exchange Service is looking for sources capable of providing a procurement fuel management solution.  The solution should include; inventory management (thru ATG, WEB and Voice input), automatic placement of fuel orders, coordinating fuel transport, bill/invoice consolidation & reconciliation of both product and taxes.

GENERAL INFORMATION.   The 311th Human Systems Wing (HSW)/ United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine (USAFSAM), Aerospace Ophthalmology Branch is planning to contract for Aeromedical Consultation Services to support the USAF Aviation Corneal Refractive Surgery (CRS) Surveillance Program and other Aerospace Ophthalmology Branch activities.

Central Contract Registration (CCR) will be mandatory for these contracts (see CCR website at www.ccr.gov).

<DESC>PEO STRI is soliciting information regarding the possibility of reutilizing two existing full-motion simulators by converting them from the current airframe configurations (MH-47E/MH-60K) to newly fielded MH-47G/MH-60M systems.<BR><BR>HISTORY:<BR>Com bat operations have prompted the fielding of two new CAAS configured airframes (MH-47G/MH-60M).  The fielding of these new aircraft has increased student training throughput requirements that exceed the current simulator capacity.   <BR><BR>PURPOSE:<BR>The  purpose of this RFI is for the Army to assess industrys ability to provide training devices by reutilizing existing MH-47E and MH-60K simulators.  This effort will address the ability to provide adequate training capability for the required throughput of  students necessary to man the force.  Based on this assessment, the Army may award a competitive contract under PEO STRIs STOC contract.  Funding is not available at this time but it is anticipated prior to award.  Vendors must possess a minimum SECRET c learance and be United States citizens.  Any information provided to the Government in response to this RFI shall be at the offerors expense.  <BR>  <BR>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI):<BR>Interested parties are requested to review the requirements and info rmation stated below and provide your written responses NLT 18 JAN 08.

The trainer shall include malfunctions occurred during operations under various simulated atmospheric and environmental  conditions.<BR><BR>2.  Trainers shall utilize existing MH-47E/MH-60K software baselines as extensively as possible.  <BR><BR>3.  Trainers shall implement stimulation of actual aircraft CAAS equipment to minimize timeframes to incorporate new CAAS versions  into the simulators.  <BR><BR>4.  The Government will provide simulator software baselines which can be used to implement the capability differences found between the legacy aircraft and the newly fielded aircraft.<BR><BR>5.  Trainers shall utilize actual  ship set equipment (stimulated systems) within the cockpit which will be provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE).<BR><BR>6.  Trainers shall utilize existing motion systems, visual displays and image generator systems.<BR><BR>7.  Reutilization wit h upgrade of the following systems is preferred over replacement:<BR>	a.

<SUBJECT>R -- Building/Maintaining SHEA/APIC Communication Network of Healthcare Professionals
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America, 1300 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 300, Arlington, VA  22209, for the purpose of building and maintaining the SHEA/APIC communication network of healthcare professionals.

Recent public health events (e.g., SARS, influenza vaccine shortages, Hurricane Katrina) have illustrated the need for real-time and bi-directional communication between infection control and healthcare epidemiology professionals and the public health system. Such a communication network would help CDC facilitate rapid exchange of information among healthcare facilities and the public health system regarding their situation and experiences during an emergency. This type of communication may facilitate the implementation of necessary infection control strategies, manage surge capacity and other finite resources, and ultimately help contain the transmission of an infectious threat.

This project is complementary to the proposed scope of the CDC Rapid Assessment Survey Program (RASP), which is to fill the significant gap in the ability to monitor the capabilities, integrity, and workplace safety of healthcare facilities during an influenza pandemic or other event. This project will help maintain a communication infrastructure among infection control and healthcare epidemiology professionals that can serve as a bi-directional communication system in the event of a public health emergency. The contractor will keep an up-to-date network membership list and solicit additional members. The contractor will participate in the development of topic-specific pre-event survey templates for the RASP program and remain committed to being available to promote and disseminate any rapid surveys deployed by RASP in the event of an emergency via the network membership. The contractor also will conduct at least one survey on an infection control topic of interest in a non-emergency situation. In addition, the contractor will perform a comparison of the characteristics of participating hospitals (i.e., Bed size, Full-time equivalent total personnel, ZIP code, and Member of Council of Teaching Hospital of the Association of American Medical Colleges) with those of a representative sample of American Hospital Association (AHA) hospitals and present CDC with a summary of their findings. 

The work to be completed under this contract can be divided into five tasks: 1) maintain a communication infrastructure in the form of a network of infection control professionals who are ready to respond to surveys in the event of a public health emergency, 2) provide technical input and subject matter expertise to CDC during conference calls to develop topic-specific pre-event survey templates for the RASP program, 3) utilize a web-based survey software to conduct at least one survey in a non-emergency situation on an infection control topic of interest to demonstrate the effectiveness of the network communication structure and provide a summary of findings, 4) promote and disseminate any rapid surveys deployed by RASP at the request of CDC in the event of an emergency via the network membership, and 5) perform a comparison of the characteristics of participating hospitals (i.e., Bed size, Full-time equivalent total personnel, ZIP code, and Member of Council of Teaching Hospital of the Association of American Medical Colleges) with those of a representative sample of American Hospital Association (AHA) hospitals and present CDC with a summary of their findings.

At a minimum, the vendor is required to have an existing communication network that is comprised of a specific subset of individuals within healthcare settings - infection control and healthcare epidemiology professionals. The vendor must have an established track record of rapid, bi-directional communication, and should have access to contact information for all members of the SHEA/APIC Communication Network. In addition, the vendor must have expert knowledge in 1) the use of current webpages (http://www.apic.org/commnetwork to access the pages via APIC's website OR http://commnetwork.shea-online.org to access the pages via SHEA's website) used to communicate with network members, 2) the use of electronic survey software (allowing ease of survey dissemination, responding, aggregation and sharing of results) and 3) the building of liaisons with the public system and other professional organizations. The following deliverables would be required: Participate in the development of topic-specific, pre-event RASP survey templates; promote/disseminate any rapid surveys deployed by RASP in the event of an emergency; conduct at least one survey in-between emergencies in order to generate helpful public health information; perform or provide necessary data to CDC to perform a comparison of hospitals represented in the network with overall US hospital characteristics; issue quarterly Progress Reports on activities, including the number of participants and the number of unique acute care hospitals represented; and deliver Final Evaluation Report.

CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<DESC>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority of the test program for commercial items Services Acquisition Reform Act (41 U.S.C. 428a), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 13.501(a)1(ii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to Advantor Systems Corporation., 12612 Challanger Pkwy, Ste 300, Orlando, Fl 32826.

1.  The 6th  Communication Squadron requires an Intrusion detection system installed in bldg P-40. 

2.  The purchase of an Intrusion detection system for bldg P-40 must be done through Advantor Systems Corporation because they are the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. All MacDill AFB alarm systems are monitored by the 6th SFS and are consolidated into a single Advantor monitoring panel for efficiency of space, maintenance, and overall operations. That said, all alarm systems to be monitored by 6th SFS must be Advantor systems to ensure compatibility with existing equipment and processes. Using any other vendor would require a change in all notification systems base-wide and would not be cost effective.

3.  Market research was conducted for the purchase of this intrusion detection system and Advantor Systems Corporation is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require. If no response to this notice is received by 10:00 AM EST on Friday, December 14, 2007, the award for this detection system for bldg P-40 will be made to Advantor Systems Corporation.

<SUBJECT>R -- Healthy Lifestyle/Obesity Prevention Campaign
<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with The Advertising Council Inc. (The Ad Council), on a sole sources basis, to plan and implement a National Adoption Recruitment Campaign.     The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by the FAR Part 6.302-1 because only one source is available to provide the service in a manner that will satisfy agency requirements.     The anticipated contract period will be for one base year with four, one year option periods.     


The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs requires the services of a contractor to develop and implement a donated public service campaign strategy and materials to address the nation?s obesity epidemic.  This campaign will create, deliver and promote effective communications that will positively change the nation?s behavior around nutrition and physical activity.  This will be accomplished through the continued promotion of the existing public service campaign, development of new youth targeted messages, development and production of new campaign marketing materials and dissemination and monitoring of public service announcement placements. 


The Ad Council is uniquely positioned, through its partnerships, non-profit status, and standing as a nationally respected organization to garner widespread support from media experts for this campaign.     The Ad Council has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to produce substantial results for expansive awareness campaigns and invented the concept of the public service announcement campaign.     These characteristics allow The Ad Council to leverage a limited investment to perform a requirement over a longer period of time with increased output.


The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above.     Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government?s requirement as articulated above.     Any interested source, in order to meet ASPA requirements will need to demonstrate and address in their capability statement (1) strong past experience with nationwide public service announcement campaigns (2) the ability to marshal and leverage volunteer talent and (3) the ability to conduct research and produce a campaign for specific populations, which may include those from different cultural backgrounds and those who do not communicate in English. No solicitation document is available.     Capability statements should be submitted by COB December 21, 2007 to the point of contact listed in this announcement.     See note 22

This requirement is being issued to enhance existing hardware.  It is needed in support of MDAýs mission: Develop and field an integrated BMDS capable of providing a layered defense for the homeland, deployed forces, friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight.  The Missile Defense Agencyýs mission is to develop, test, and prepare for deployment a missile defense system. Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats.  Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system.  Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology.  IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet ý a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test.  No other software exists that affords the capability.  Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDAýs program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture.  Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agencyýs requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the programýs mission.<BR><BR>

Using complementary interceptors, land, sea, and air space based sensors, and battle management command and control systems, the planned missile defense system will be able to engage all classes and ranges of ballistic missile threats.  Our programmatic strategy is to develop, rigorously test, and continuously evaluate production, deployment and operational alternatives for the ballistic missile defense system.  Missile defense systems being developed and tested by MDA are primarily based on hit-to-kill technology.  IT has been described as hitting a bullet with a bullet ý a capability that has been successfully demonstrated in test after test.  No other software exists that affords the capability.  Hitachi hardware has been adopted by MDAýs program and this interface is the only one that will work with this existing hardware architecture.  Any other type of support will add extra costs of an additional hardware interface. There is only one responsible hardware product and no other support will satisfy the agencyýs requirements because of equipment requirements. Failure to provide this single type of hardware support will have a significant adverse effect on the programýs mission.<BR><BR>

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by this agency.

OTHER CONTRACT TERMS AND CONDITIONS:

NOTICE OF CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS (OCT 2005)

Compliance with Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) and Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 201 (FIPS 201) entitled "Personal Identification Verification (PIV) for Federal Employees and Contractors," Phase I.
 
1. 	Long-Term Contractor Personnel: 

In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:     

a.	Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB  No. 1615-0047,  " Employment Eligibility Verification, "  and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);

b.	Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents.  This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;

c.	Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position.  Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:  
 
?High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)

?Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)

?Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation
    
d.	The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a:  

1)	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
2)	Favorable fingerprint results; 
3)	Favorable credit report, if required; 
4)	Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and 
5)	Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements. 
 
If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM ' s scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). 
 
e.	Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated.  If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.
 
2.	Short-Term Contractor Personnel:  

It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above.  The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are:
 
a.	Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; 
b.	Favorable fingerprint results; 
c.	Favorable credit report, if required; and 
d.	Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment.  The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated.  

A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance.  This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period.  This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. 
For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements.  However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered ?long-term? and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy.  

3.	Intermittent Contractors:

An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors.  

a.	For purposes of this policy, ?intermittent? is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access.  For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract.    

b.	Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department?s escort policy.  Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access.   

c.	Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required.  

d.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.

e.	If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year.  If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year. 
  
4.	An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements.  

5.	The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice.

Performance Period: The periods of performance of the resulting contract shall be:

Project Overview.  The mission of the 19th Sustainment Command (Expeditionary) (ESC) is to provide Combat Service Support throughout the Republic of Korean (ROK).  As part of this mission, the 19th ESC supports automa ted logistics systems.  The primary purpose of this contract is to provide technical support services to various Logistic Standard Army Management Information Systems (STAMIS) within the Republic of South Korea.  Over time, these systems are expected to ev olve into a family of systems called the Global Combat Support System Army (GCSS-ARMY).  This requirement stems from the need at the Sustainment Command level and below for skilled personnel that can provide functional and technical support to all STAMIS systems.  These STAMIS are a family of computer systems.  Each system specializes in an area related to Communications, Maintenance, Supply and Transportation Management, to support Army missions.   These systems are:  (a) Combat Service Support Information Systems Interface (CAISI)  (b) Standard Army Ammunition Systems (SAAS)  (c) Standard Army Maintenance System (SAMS 1&2)  (d) Standard Army Retail Supply Syst em  Level One (SARSS1)  (e) Property Book Unit Supply Enhanced (PBUSE)  (f) Unit Level Logistics System - Ground (ULLS-G)  (g) Transportation Coordinator Automated Information Movements System (TC-AIMS)  Each system generates a large amount of data, both historical and current.  The data is necessary to ensure a viable Army maintenance, supply, communications and transportation program and or to help with other critical Army mission support.  While PBUSE and TC-AIMS require support these two STAMIS are web  based and do not require the same level of support as the other STAMIS. The PBUSE and TC-AIMS support requirements are functional (training), networking and occasional breakaway (stand alone) configuration.  Clearances and Licensing: A security clearance of U.S. Secret is required for all Contractor employees.  The vendor will adhere to the DD Form 254.  All Contractor personnel working on this contract must be US citizens.  In addition, Contractor personnel working on this contract shall be fluent in the English language as exemplified in their written and verbal skills.  Tasks:  (1)  The Contractor shall provide help desk (physically located on Camp Henry) and on site area support, at Camp Henry Taegu (Area IV), Camp Casey Dongduchon (Area I), Yongsan Seo ul (Area II) and Camp Humphreys Pyongtaek (Area III) ROK.  The contractor employee providing area support outside of Area IV will be considered the technical expert on one or more STAMIS while providing backup support for the other STAMIS systems.  The con tractor employees serve as the initial point of contact for all STAMIS questions and liaison with other STAMIS technical experts as necessary.  (2)  Current IT Working Environment:  Infrastructure consists of coaxial, twisted pair and fiber optic cable, ut ilizing hubs, routers and switches for distribution purposes.  Systems operate networked, primarily in a garrison environment with the ability to operate tactically when necessary. Servers predominately use Microsoft 2000 with some Solaris, and UnixWare sy stems.  Workstations are of various makes and models but all are Intel architecture running various versions of Microsoft Operating Systems.  Technical support is as follows:  The Contractor shall provide Help Desk technical support within two (2) hours of  being notified of a problem. Help desk support will cover technical and functional assistance to customers. During duty hours the contractor will respond within six (6) hours if a customer requires on-site assistance.  During Non-Duty hours the contractor  will notify the Contract Representative for a decision on whether a problem is routine and can wait until the next duty day or is considered an urgent need and requires immediate assistance (within six (6) hours response time).  The Contractor shall devel op and maintain a STAMIS WEB page for the 19th ESC CSSAMO/LTT.  The purpose of this website is to provide information and communication with all STAMIS users in the Korean Theater of Operation.  The website will be maintained on a server maintained by the contractor and/or the government.  The software, hardware/server and the hosting will be provided by the government and will be part of the existing domain and/or interface with the domain.

This site will provide file sharing (i.e. updates, information papers), collaboration (i.e. message threads, billboard), troubleshooting  assistance (i.e. frequently asked questions, contact information, updates).  The government will be responsible for approving all content and appearance of website.  The website will be updated on a biweekly basis at a minimum. The website will comply wit h existing website standards (i.e. 508 compliant, accessible on multiple operating system platforms).

Distribution of the change will be by INTERNET, CD-ROM, or diskette mailed to the Contractor.  The Contractor shall provide recommendations regarding command inspection checklists and internal/external standard operating procedures following ea ch software change/update, or as seen fit by the Contractor.  The Contractor may provide recommendations regarding shortfalls in logistics STAMIS training. The Contractor will assist in developing fielding plans for new systems and Continuity of Operation Plans (COOP).  The Contractor shall install, implement, and test all change packages to ensure compatibility with the Version Description Document (VDD).  On completion of testing, copies will be made and distributed for installation by the help desk perso nnel to the appropriate STAMIS locations. If there is not a knowledgeable authorized individual at the appropriate STAMIS location to install the VDD, then the VDD will be installed by the local CSSAMO or by the contractor employee, on approval of the Cont ract Representative.
