The -16 PTMLB is a military unique design that provides unique capabilities not found in the commercial market. Contract FA8533-05-D-0003 was awarded to Testek <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>on 02 Sep 2005. Due to outstanding deficiencies, the Air Force ability to properly sustain, operate, maintain, or troubleshoot the PTMLB was limited. The modified TO will assist the customer in troubleshooting and diagnosis of the PTMLB. The modified TO will reflect the design changes incorporated through the implementation of all ECP's, as applicable. The TO will include both configurations of the PTMLB. Testek has proprietary rights to the PTMLB design and software. The period of performance to update the Technical Manual is estimated to be 20 - 24 weeks after the receipt of the contract.

<p><strong>Background: <br /></strong>The Inherited Movement Disorders Unit (IMDU) research focuses on genetic cause of movements disorders, with a particular focus on recessive causes of Parkinson's disease. To date, the IMDU researchers have investigated the roles of Pink1 and Parkin, two genes linked to recessive Parkinson's disease, in a mitochondrial quality control pathway in cell culture. Researchers want to incorporate genetically modified mice that model Parkinson's disease into studies to validate findings in cell culture. Additionally, the researchers want to validate novel methods for measuring mitochondrial protein turnover in vivo using transgenic mouse models. The fully automated fluorescent microscope with laser capture microdissection and line-scanning confocal modules is needed to capture small areas of interest from brain tissue and muscle for downstream DNA, RNA, and proteomics analysis. Additionally, the microscope is needed for imaging mitochondria in living acute brain slices.</p>

The consultant will be reimbursed for travel to provide support at a Government site or other site as may be specified under the contract. Consultant shall provide supporting documentation and a detailed breakdown of incurred travel costs with each invoice. 

BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION:

In accordance with 25 U.S.C. 3201 (P.L. 101-630), Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act; 42 U.S.C. 13041, Crime Control Act of 1990; 441 Departmental Manual, Personnel Security and Suitability Requirements all positions with duties and responsibilities involving regular contact with or control over Indian children are subject to a background investigation and determination of suitability for employment.

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Education (BIE), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Education, Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract. Pending completion of a background investigation by OPM, the Contractor who has been granted a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be within the sight and under the supervision of a Government employee who has had a completed background investigation (42 U.S.C 13041 (3)) during contract performance until a final background investigation determination has been made.

Prior employment with the Federal Government, including BIA or BIE does not assure that the appropriate screening or investigation was conducted nor does it alleviate or guarantee a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination or background investigation.

Prior to an award or during the 60 day period discussed in paragraph two, it is solely the company, individual or contractor's responsibility to contact the BIE Security and Suitability Program at 505-563-5287/5288/5289/5294 in order to obtain a complete security package, which includes but is not limited to appropriate investigative forms and/or inquire about their previous investigation; and, obtain a screening (applicant and suitability) determination, and subsequent final background investigation.

If an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination is made, a purchase order shall not be awarded to the individual who received an unfavorable screening or to the company who has proposed to employ the individual to perform the work. The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. 

If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIE, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

Award will be made on a Best Value Basis, whose quotation is conforming to the requirements herein, will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable. 

52.212-2  Evaluation-Commercial Items.
EVALUATION-COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) 

(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

1.  Familiarity with location
2.  Technical Approach
3.  Past Performance

All evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.

Submit detailed information for each evaluation factor.

Responses for each evaluation factor will need to be submitted with your proposal.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<p><strong>AFFARS 5352.201-9101&nbsp;OMBUDSMAN (JUN 2016)<br /></strong><br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the interested party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-line-height-rule: exactly; mso-layout-grid-align: none">
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<p>1.	In question #3 it asks -What version of AMAG Symmetry is currently running for this system?  The answer given was a model number of a card reader rather than the symmetry version.
