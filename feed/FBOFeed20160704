<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), DBS, Lymphoid Malignancies Branch plans to procure on a sole source basis testing services to monitor Conduct Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 analysis on 155 DLBCL samples from Advance BioMedical Laboratories, 1605 Industrial Hwy Cinnaminson, NJ 08077. <br /><br />This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.106-1 (b)(2) and 13.501-(a)(1) using simplified acquisition procedures for commercial acquisitions. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $14.0 Million.
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The period of performance is twelve (12) months from date of award.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>NCI/CCR/DBS/LMB the Staudt Lab in the Lymphoid Malignancies Branch at the National Cancer Institute is engaged in the study of lymphoma genomes. Investigating genomic structural variation, genetic alteration and its effect on the development and biology of lymphomas is an integral function of the Lymphoid Malignancies Branch. The integrative analysis of genetic lesions in more than 600 diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) includes high-throughput sequencing of whole transcriptomes and exomes and Affymetrix SNP array 6.0 analyses.<br /><br /><strong>A. Contractor Technical requirements: </strong><br />The contractor shall provide services for Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 analysis from 155 DLBCL samples.</p>
<p>Specifically, this work shall involve the following: <br />1. Receive DNA shipped from NCI to the contractor's lab. <br />2. Use 0.5 ug (microgram) of genomic DNA.<br />3. Analyze the samples on the Affymetrix SNP Array 6.0: <br />&bull; Synthesize biotin labeled DNA hybridization targets.<br />&bull; Hybridize amplified DNA to Affymetrix arrays.<br />&bull; Stain and scan arrays.<br />&bull; Provide genotyping results in electronic format.<br />&bull; Provide quality control, raw data and analysis reports (standard Affymetrix output files for averaged cell intensities and analysis output).<br />4. The contractor shall be responsible for the cost of all reagents (kits, arrays, etc.) required for the analysis. <br />5. Return all unused DNA to NCI.</p>
<p><strong>B. Reporting Requirements and Deliverables: </strong><br />After completion of the analysis the contractor shall provide the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) all standard Affymetrix output files as well as summary tables which describes the basic quality information for each sample (Call rates, HET Rates, Contrast QC scores, etc.) delivered for each specimen analyzed.<br /><br /><strong>C. Government Responsibilities:</strong><br />COR will review and approve deliverables within two weeks of reception of the completion report by the contractor to assure that requirements set forth in this statement of work are met.</p>
<p><strong>D. Inspection and Acceptance Criteria:</strong><br />The delivery of results of the data generated will be inspected and approved by COR within four (4) weeks of receipt of the final completion report.</p>
<p>Advanced BioMedical Laboratories (ABML) has performed Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 for the Staudt lab from more than 400 DLBCL samples. To extend the ongoing genomic study of human DLBCL and ensure continuity of data analysis it will be essential to maintain the same technical analytical methodology. In addition, the extension of the analyses in a different laboratory could lead to incomparability of the two data sets. ABML is the only vendor known that can meet the Government's requirements.</p>
<p>This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. However, if any interested party, especially small business believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a proposal or quote for the Government to consider. The response and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. Responses must be received in the contracting office by 11 AM EST, on July 14, 2016. All responses and questions must be in writing and faxed to 240-276-5399 or emailed to Reyes Rodriguez, Contracting Officer via electronic mail at reyes.rodriguez@nih.gov.

In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA) through sam.gov.

Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ``I agree'' click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ``click-wrap'' or ``browse-wrap'' agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u) (1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.
