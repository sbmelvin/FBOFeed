<p>The Construction work consists of, but is not limited to, reconstruction of existing trails, new construction for minor existing trail reroutes, improvement, replacement, or construction of trail bridges, puncheons and turnpikes, installation of drainage features such as or waterbars and culverts, and installation of trail signs and/or trail interpretive signs.</p>
<p>The Service work consists of, but is not limited to, logout and clearing of trail, tread maintenance, drainage structure improvements and/or maintenance, and maintenance of trail signs.</p>
<p>A copy of the site location for the first task order (along with the map) is listed in the prospectus/ pre-solicitation notice attached.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and will be for period of approximately five years. The contract will be firm fixed price.</p>

The Government is anticipating making three awards and there is a possibility up to six awards many be made.</p>
<p>The minimum guarantee will be listed in the solicitation along with the ceiling price.</p>
<p>Work will be assigned by the placement of Task Orders issued against the basic contract. The physical work and location will be identified in individual Task Orders.</p>
<p>Task orders will be placed based on Forest priorities, site conditions and funding availability.</p>
<p>The task orders are estimated between $2,000 and $500,000. For any construction task order over $35,000 the contractor must provide a payment bond. For construction task orders over $250,000, contractors must provide both payment and performance bonds.</p>
<p>The Logout and Tread Cleaning annual services are generally required to be done within two weeks of snow melt for most trails. The most intensive period of service annual maintenance task orders work occurs in late June and early July, when over half of the trails open almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>The field work on the other task orders is estimated from May 1th through November 1st depending on weather and site locations.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall utilize products and materials that promote energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, use of recovered materials, that are environmentally preferable, and made from bio- based materials including but not limited to: 2-Cycle Engine Oils: Chain and Cable Lubricants; Diesel Fuel Additives; Engine Crankcase Oil; Fuel Conditioners; Gasoline Fuel Additives; Gear Lubricants; Greases; Hydraulic Fluids; etc.) to the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intended end use of detracting from the overall quality delivered. Visit www.biopreferred.gov for additional information on BioPreferred Products.</p>
<p>This project will be advertised as a written request for proposals.</p>
<p>Estimated issue date of the solicitation is on or about the first week in April, 2019. The solicitation will be posted electronically at this (FedBizOpps) site when it issues. No hard copies of the solicitation or amendments will be mailed. The actual proposal due date will be listed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Awards will be made to the offerors who offers the best value to the Government. Award is estimated to be in the Spring of 2019.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. NAICS code is 237990, size standard is $36.5 million and is applicable to the construction task orders. For the service task orders, the NAICS code is 115310 and the size stand is $7.5 million.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered. An electronic copy of the solicitation will be posted at the site on the issue date.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Funding for this requirement is currently not available, but is anticipated for this fiscal year 2019. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the solicitation's closing date. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>A special notice was issued on November 5, 2018 (reference Notice 1205G119R0004SN). The reason for the notice to be issued then was to allow for potential offerors to visit the units last fall to ascertain the extent of work involved and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the prices to the extent the information is obtainable and while the sites are still accessible. Some changes from the notice may occur from the actual solicitation, but the enclosed information is a representative of work to be done.</p>
<p>Information about the site of the first task order is attached with this notice.</p>
<p>In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after the contract has been awarded. No guided tours will be held. For information about the site location, please call Lucy Reeves at 509.684.7244.</p>
<p>The Government assumes no responsibility for any understanding or representation concerning conditions made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of a contract, unless such understanding or representation the Government is expressly stated in a subsequent solicitation and contract.</p>
<p>All inquiries concerning this potential project must be directed to me a 509.684.7114 or fax 509.684.7280. You may also e-mail me at cvanalyne@fs.fed.us.</p>

<DESC><br />Colville Trail Construction and Trail Maintenance.
<p><br />Notice this Special Notice is replaced with presoliciation notice 1205G119R0004.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Colville National Forest has a requirement for trail construction and maintenance services throughout the Colville National Forest. Location of the work will be in Stevens, Ferry and Pend Oreille Counties, Washington (located in the NE portion of Washington State).</p>
<p>The Forest proposes to contract for the work during the winter of 2018/2019.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall furnish all management, labor, equipment, supervision, tools, materials, transportation, operating supplies, workman's compensation, unemployment insurance and incidentals necessary to perform the work in accordance with the specification and provisions of the contract and individual task orders.</p>
<p>The Construction work consists of, but is not limited to, reconstruction of existing trails, new construction for minor existing trail reroutes, improvement, replacement, or construction of trail bridges, puncheons and turnpikes, installation of drainage features such as or waterbars and culverts, and installation of trail signs and/or trail interpretive signs.</p>
<p>The Service work consists of, but is not limited to, logout and clearing of trail, tread maintenance, drainage structure improvements and/or maintenance, and maintenance of trail signs.</p>
<p>A copy of the site location for the first task order (along with the map) is listed in the prospectus/ pre-solicitation notice attached.</p>
<p>The resultant contract will be an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract and will be for period of approximately five years. The contract will be firm fixed price.</p>
<p>Work will be divided into two items: construction services applicable to the Wage Rate Requirements (Construction) and maintenance services subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards Act. The Government is anticipating making three awards and there is a possibility up to six awards many be made.</p>
<p>The minimum guarantee will be listed in the solicitation along with the ceiling price.</p>
<p>Work will be assigned by the placement of Task Orders issued against the basic contract. The physical work and location will be identified in individual Task Orders.</p>
<p>Task orders will be placed based on Forest priorities, site conditions and funding availability.</p>
<p>The task orders are estimated between $2,000 and $500,000. For any construction task order over $35,000 the contractor must provide a payment bond. For construction task orders over $250,000, contractors must provide both payment and performance bonds.</p>
<p>The Logout and Tread Cleaning annual services are generally required to be done within two weeks of snow melt for most trails. The most intensive period of service annual maintenance task orders work occurs in late June and early July, when over half of the trails open almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>The field work on the other task orders is estimated from May 1th through November 1st depending on weather and site locations.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall utilize products and materials that promote energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, use of recovered materials, that are environmentally preferable, and made from bio- based materials including but not limited to: 2-Cycle Engine Oils: Chain and Cable Lubricants; Diesel Fuel Additives; Engine Crankcase Oil; Fuel Conditioners; Gasoline Fuel Additives; Gear Lubricants; Greases; Hydraulic Fluids; etc.) to the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intended end use of detracting from the overall quality delivered. Visit www.biopreferred.gov for additional information on BioPreferred Products.</p>
<p>This project will be advertised as a written request for proposals.</p>
<p>Estimated issue date of the solicitation is on or about March 1, 2019 (maybe sooner). The solicitation will be posted electronically at this (FedBizOpps) site when it issues. No hard copies of the solicitation or amendments will be mailed. The actual proposal due date will be listed in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Awards will be made to the offerors who offers the best value to the Government. Awards are estimated to be in the Spring of 2019.</p>
<p>This acquisition is 100% set-aside for small business concerns. NAICS code is 237990, size standard is $36.5 million and is applicable to the construction task orders. For the service task orders, the NAICS code is 115310 and the size stand is $7.5 million.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered. An electronic copy of the solicitation will be posted at the site on the issue date.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p>Funding for this requirement is currently not available, but is anticipated for this fiscal year 2019. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the solicitation's closing date. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs incurred.</p>
<p>The reason for the notice to be issued this time of year is to allow for potential offferors to visit the units this fall to ascertain the extent of work involved and to satisfy themselves regarding all general and local conditions that may affect the prices to the extent the information is obtainable and while the sites are still accessible. Some changes from this notice may occur from the actual solicitation, but the enclosed information is a representative of work to be done.</p>
<p>Information about the site of the first task order is attached with this notice.</p>
<p>In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after the contract has been awarded. No guided tours will be held. For information about the site location, please call Lucy Reeves at 509.684.7244.</p>
<p>The Government assumes no responsibility for any understanding or representation concerning conditions made by any of its officers or agents prior to the execution of a contract, unless such understanding or representation the Government is expressly stated in a subsequent solicitation and contract.</p>
<p>All inquiries concerning this potential project must be directed to me a 509.684.7114 or fax 509.684.7280. You may also e-mail me at cvanalyne@fs.fed.us.</p>
