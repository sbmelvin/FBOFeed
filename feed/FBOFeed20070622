This effort will entail development of detailed 3-D models, design and analysis, and drawing updates and will require Subject Matter Expertise to provide distance and on-site RMS on LCS integration aboard LCS-1 and LCS-2.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Toxicology and Environmental Information Program (TEHIP) to enter into a sole source procurement to license the Scientific and Technical Information Network (STN) system from Chemical Abstracts Services (CAS), 2540 Olentangy River Road, Columbus, OH 43202-1505.  The STN is an online database service that provides global access to published research, journal literature, patents, structures, sequences, properties and other data.   NLM will use the STN to: (1) search and monitor toxicological literature and validate chemical authority data in files such as those in Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET).  

This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541690 and the business size standard is $6.5.  NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about July 9, 2007.

Period of Performance: 
The period of performance will be one year from the date of award plus four one-year options.  NLM anticipates that award will be made on or about July 9, 2007.

Sole Source Justification: 
In accordance with FAR 13.106(b)(1), it has been determined that the circumstances of this requirement (licensing agreement) deem only one source reasonably available.  In addition, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1) as set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) at 6.302, Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) is the only known source that is capable of fulfilling this requirement.  The Scientific and Technical Information Network (STN) is a unique resource that is only available from CAS.  The STN includes an international chemical registry system encompassing over 25 million chemical substances.  According to market research, no other vendor maintains such a large database or is more widely recognized and used as the authority for chemical substance information.  
								
This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available.  However, if any interested party believes it can fulfill the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.   The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NLM to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT July 6, 2007.  Faxed capability statements are NOT authorized.  Questions must be submitted in writing to Robin Hope-Williams at rhwilli@mail.nih.gov.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.   No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541370   The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Wilburn Township for the analysis of the efficiency of seepage pit type BMPs.  The study will tie together the results from a field study and other data that have been collected by the Townships of Millburn and Summit to draw conclusions regarding the efficiency of seepage pits on a watershed basis.   US EPA requires a contractor that  possesses the unique capabilities of (1) collaborating with two municipalities to sample at their BMPs within two entire watersheds and obtain necessary associated data; (2) devoting resources free-of-charge to do monitoring and collect and mail samples; and (3) possessing the existing data related  to determining the efficiency of seepage pits.  Milburn Township is the only known source able to satisfy the Government's requirement(s) because they own and operate 1300 and 50 seepage pits installed in Millburn and Summit, respectively since 1999 (Millburn) and 2005 (Summit) under ordinance.   Furthermore Millburn and Summit have data from previous studies.  This data is necessary to insure the accuracy of this study. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications.   Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be  considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.  The applicable NAICS code is 541370.  Please submit your request in writing to Courtney Whiting by e-mail to whiting.courtney@epa.gov.  No telephone requests or request  by fax will be honored.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) intends to negotiate with The Advertising Council Inc. (The Ad Council), on a sole sources basis, to plan and implement a National Adoption Recruitment Campaign.  The basis for restricting competition is the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by the FAR Part 6.302-1 because only one source is available to provide the service in a manner that will satisfy agency requirements.  The anticipated contract period will be for one base year with four, one year option periods.  

 

The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) requires the services of a contractor to develop and implement a donated public service campaign strategy to recruit and connect foster and adoptive families with waiting children throughout the United States who are in the foster care system.  This shall include a theme message, define a target audience, and recommended media placement.  ACF requires a unique annual campaign on a focus area or specific population to be determined each year.  Moreover, the contractor will design and carryout a series of evaluation activities to capture the results of the dissemination effort and the impact of the campaign to support ACF meeting its adoption goals.  The campaign is encouraged by Congress and will generate public attention to the issue of children awaiting adoption from the foster care system to improve the rate of adoption of these children.  

 

The Ad Council is uniquely positioned, through its partnerships, non-profit status, and standing as a nationally respected organization to garner widespread support from media experts for this campaign.  The Ad Council has repeatedly demonstrated the ability to produce substantial results for expansive awareness campaigns and invented the concept of the public service announcement campaign.  These characteristics allow The Ad Council to leverage a limited investment to perform a requirement over a longer period of time with increased output.

 

The purpose of this synopsis is to determine whether there may be other sources with the necessary expertise and qualifications to perform the work described above.  Any source capable of performing the work should submit a statement of capabilities with documentation supporting its ability to meet the Government?s requirement as articulated above.  Any interested source, in order to meet ACF requirements will need to demonstrate and address in their capability statement (1) strong past experience with nationwide public service announcement campaigns (2) the ability to marshal and leverage volunteer talent and (3) the ability to conduct research and produce a campaign for specific populations, which may include those from different cultural backgrounds and those who do not communicate in  English.   No solicitation document is available.  Capability statements should be submitted by 4 pm Eastern Time on August 6, 2007 to the point of contact listed in this announcement.  See note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.

This project replaces the remote monitoring  and control system, Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for  the primary electrical power distribution system located at WPAFB. This  system consists of power sensors, relays, remote terminal units, and the  interconnecting control conductors in 9 substations located throughout the  base. It also consists of a front end computer system located in one  central facility along with other remote monitoring sites. This project  requires very specialized equipment and computer programming to result in  a fully functional SCADA system.  The SCADA system monitors the entire  primary electrical distribution system, and allows for complete control of  that system. The scope will also include associated architectural, civil,  structural, mechanical, plumbing, electrical and miscellaneous work as  shown on the project drawings and described in the specifications. NAICS  Code 238210 Size Standard $13.0 Million. The overall estimated price range  is between $1M and $5M. Period of Performance is 365 days.

<DESC>The Department of Defense Education Activity?s (DoDEA) Education Division intends to award on a competitive basis, using commercial procedures, a contract to fulfill its requirement for Xiotech Magnitude System Continuation Warranty Extension and Brocade maintenance agreement.  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the purchase of Xiotech Magnitude warranties and renewals.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government?s requirements, for DoDEA?s infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.

<SUBJECT>84--HEADBORNE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION - MODIFIED SOURCES SOUGHT
<SOLNBR>M6785407I3047
<RESPDATE>080607
<CONTACT>Ms. S. Leigh D'Lugos Phone: 703-432-3187 Cell: 540-455-8037 Email: susan.dlugos.ctr@usmc.mil
<DESC>THIS MODIFIED SOURCES SOUGHT REPLACES THE ORIGINAL SOURCES SOUGHT POSTED ON MAY 7 2007 IN ITS ENTIRETY. BACKGROUND Marines engaged in combat operations wear a suite of body armor that includes a ballistic helmet.  This helmet is either the USMC Lightweight Helmet (LWH) with a pad suspension system or the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH).  A number of additional pieces of equipment are being attached to, or worn with, the helmet.  These include night vision devices, spectacles, goggles, flashlights or infrared (IR) illuminators, radio headsets, and/or ear protection.   As the threat has continued to evolve, a requirement has been realized for additional ballistic facial protection and lower mandible protection devices.  Additionally, the requirement for communications equipment integration and a universal mounting system for the employment of the additional pieces of equipment has become evident as we have fielded a greater amount of equipment.  The Marine Corps is taking a system-of-systems approach to headborne equipment integration and desires to procure a suite of equipment that use the current inventory of helmets as a foundation.  With the system in place, Marines will be able to select components to wear either alone or combined as required.  This capability provides the desired modular, integrated systems approach to the helmet. SOURCES SOUGHT MARKET RESEARCH.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS.  The Marine Corps Systems Command invites industry to provide information on their capability to provide a Headborne Integration System (HBIS), that includes a lightweight system that will affix to both the LWH and MICH (without any modification) and will provide mounting points for other equipment, including:  (1) a transparent face shield that provides ballistic protection to the face area between the helmet and the lower mandible protector; (2) a lower mandible protection device that will provide a level of ballistic protection from the transparent face shield to below the lower mandible commensurate with the level provided by the LWH while still allowing for the proper sighting of an individual or crew served weapon; (3) a universal mounting device for current and future optics; (4) and open-architecture mounting points for additional equipment, such as flashlights, illuminators, ear phones, or other equipment that may b!  e required in the future.   HEADBORNE INTEGRATION SYSTEM (HBIS) COMPONENT LEVEL REQUIREMENTS Attachment System The attachment system shall affix to the helmet without requiring additional attachment holes and without degrading the ballistic protection, durability and rigidity of the helmet.  This attachment system is intended to integrate with the helmet to provide a platform for the scalability of protection for the design.  The attachment system shall integrate communications wiring.  Communications equipment required to be used with this device includes the Nacre Quiet Pro, the Personal Role Radio (PRR) Headset with the microphone, and standard PRC handset.  Hardware utilized to construct the HBIS should not require modification to the helmet.  The means of attachment to the helmet must not pose a risk to the wearer, including a decrease in ballistic protection or delamination of the helmet shell.   Face Shield A transparent face shield that mounts to the attachment system is required for additional ballistic protection for the face.  The face shield shall be easily removed by the user as desired without requiring a special tool.  The face shield must, at a minimum, meet the ballistic requirements set forth in MIL-V-43511C, clause 3.5.10.  The shield shall minimize distortion and optical haze.  The face shield shall be resistant to fogging.  The face shield should be able to be worn with the current ballistic eyewear (ESS ICE2X Spectacles).  The face shield shall allow for the integration of a lower mandible protection device and other equipment worn with the HBIS.  The face shield shall not interfere with the ability of a Marine to properly sight and employ individual and crew served weapons affixed with current and future optics, aiming devices, and head-mounted optics.   Lower Mandible Protection Device The lower mandible protection device shall provide ballistic protection equal to that of the current LWH.  The lower mandible protection device is intended to integrate with the face shield defined above.  The device shall be easily removed by the user as desired without requiring a special tool.  The lower mandible protection device shall not interfere with the ability of a Marine to properly sight and employ individual and crew served weapons affixed with current and future optics, aiming devices, and head-mounted optics.   USMC Optics Mount The optics mount shall provide a universal mount for current and future USMC optics in a stable location on the helmet that ensures the users ability to effectively employ the given optic.  Current optics mounts do not adequately address the stability needed for night vision goggles.  The mount is not currently employed in an optimal location on the helmet.  The desired mount should be in a location that does not shift the center of gravity for the helmet and provides stability to the night vision goggles.  TOTAL SYSTEM WEIGHT The total system weight, including the helmet, should not exceed 5.5 lbs.  The components requested should therefore be weighted accordingly.  Components outlined in Blocks I and II are of higher priority. ANTICIPATED ACQUISITION PHASES A block acquisition approach is anticipated.   Block I of the HBIS will address the near-term solution of an attachment system to provide mounting points for additional components, and a face shield to provide additional ballistic protection for the face.  The attachment system should have a sufficient number of points to allow for all of the required gear to be worn.  The system shall not impede firing of the weapon or communications (aided or unaided). Block II of the HBIS will address the addition of a lower mandible protector to provide blast and fragmentation protection to the lower part of the face. Block III of the HBIS will address the addition of a universal night observation device mount to be compatible with current and future USMC optics. Block IV of the HBIS will address the addition of other desired components to the attachment system, including a hands-free light, illuminators, and ear phones.   INDUSTRY DAY (THIS EVENT HAS ALREADY OCCURRED) MARCORSYSCOM will host a Headborne Systems Integration Industry Conference from 23-24 May 2007, at Kalman & Company Inc., 50 Tech Parkway, Stafford, Virginia, 22556.

The Navy anticipates the award to be a firm fixed price contract. No solicitation will be available for this procurement.

DESCRIPTION OF AMENDMENT/MODIFICATION (Organized by UCF section headings, including solicitation/contract subject matter where feasible.) Amendment 0001 is hereby issued to clarify the requirements of the solicitation. Q.  Bond information on Page 3 of the solicitation is different from Clause 52.228-1, which one is correct? A.  Change Clause 52.228-1 to reflect that the amount of the bid guarantee shall be not less than 20% of the bid price but shall not exceed $3,000,000. Q.  Is the pipe sizes listed in the specifications or drawings? A.  Yes, they are in the drawings. Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the document referenced in Item 9A or 10A, as heretofore changed, remains unchanged and in full force and effect. 15A. NAME AND TITLE OF SIGNER (Type or print)	16A. NAME AND TITLE OF CONTRACTING OFFICER (Type or print) 	Keith E. Waye, Contracting Officer 15B. CONTRACTOR/OFFEROR	15C. DATE SIGNED	16B. UNITED STATES OF AMERICA	16C. DATE SIGNED 		BY	06/22/07 (Signature of person authorized to sign)		(Signature of Contracting Officer)	 NSN 7540-01-152-8070	30-105	STANDARD FORM 30 (REV. 10-83) PREVIOUS EDITIONS UNUSABLE		Prescribed by GSA 		FAR (48 CFR) 53.243 A-0001	Page 2 of 2   VA-241-07-RP-0061      ITEM NO. 14 CONTINUED:  Q.  should the contractor carry anything for asbestos? A.  No, most areas have been tested for asbestos, if there is any it would be a very small amount. Q.  Is there any additional work that is not shown on the drawings? A.  No, if there is any additional work it would be treated as a differing site condition. Q.  How do we bid the deductive line items? A.  The VA uses deductive line items instead of additive line items.  The first line item is the entire project.  The second line item is the entire project with the exception of Bldg 207, 2nd floor.  The third line item is the entire project with the exception of Bldg 207, 3rd floor.  The fourth line item is the entire project with the exception of the South wing of building 200, 4th floor south. Q.  The pipe spec indicates &#189;&quot; - 1&quot; pipe will be PEX, but the insulation spec. indicates that cold water is to be insulated with polyisocyanurate P.C. which is a rigid product unsuitable for flexible piping.  Armaflex P.C. (flexible elastomeric unicellular) would be a suitable product compatible w/PEX and is much more economical than polyisocyanurate in reduced thickness (since it's only required to control condensation).  Can we substitute Armaflex for polyiso. foam  on CW, and if so, what thickness applies? A.  Armaflex insulation is permitted and preferred for use on PEX tubing, and for all other hot and cold water piping.  The thickness required would be 1/2&quot; for all cold water piping up to and including 6&quot; dia. pipe; for hot water, 1/2&quot; up to and including 4&quot; dia. pipe.  For hot &amp; cold water over the diameter limits stated, insulation shall to 3/4&quot; thick. Q.  Where Armaflex (flexible elastomeric unicellular) is allowed, the specification/pg 15250-12, section 3.2, par. C.1) indicates to apply 2 coats of &quot;finish&quot;, which is primarily used to add U.V. protection in exterior conditions.  Since this is all interior work is the finish still required? A.  A finish is not required on interior Armaflex insulation unless the V.A. specifically requires a finish on interior insulation. Q.  Dwg. 200-P2 detail 1 shows flex. unicell. insulation on PEX @ hangers with a continuous support.  Is this detail allowing Armaflex on CW (as requested in #1 above) and if so, with what thickness? A.  Armaflex insulation is permitted and preferred for use on PEX tubing, and for all other hot and cold water piping.  The thickness required would be 1/2&quot; for all cold water piping up to and including 6&quot; dia. pipe; for hot water, 1/2&quot; up to and including 4&quot; dia. pipe.  For hot &amp; cold water over the diameter limits stated, insulation shall to 3/4&quot; thick. Q.  Metal jackets referenced on pg 15250-10, par 3.15: what type metal, finish and thickness is required? 1.	A.  Metal jackets may be aluminum, 0.020 inch thick, as manufactured by Childers or Manville, etc.  Q.  Re.: the basement piping shown on dwg. 207-P1: is this a crawlspace or reduced access area? A.  The area beyond the walls of the mechanical room is technically a crawl space but a man can walk most of it [hunched over slightly].  Some areas may be congested and difficult to work in.

Responses to the SIR must be used to screen qualified companies. Screening information allows the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine which offers are more likely to receive award, and ultimately, which offers will provide the FAA with the best value. The FAA has appointed an Integrated Product Team (IPT) who will evaluate each response received and makes a selection of qualified offerors based on the evaluation criteria established in this SIR. The SIR evaluation process may involve face-to-face negotiations with one or more offerors. The intent of these negotiations are for the FAA evaluators, or IPT, to gain a better understanding of the proposed project and/or to clarify evaluation information submitted by the offeror. All offerors that are eliminated from the competition will be notified in writing. Written responses to this SIR are due by close of business (4:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time) on JULY 10, 2007.  II.

This will need to be accomplished AFTER all asbestos for the interior of the project areas have been removed. All work must be coordinated in order to maintain an operational facility.  The total contract duration for completion of the work shall be 365 calendar days, excluding the following FAA holiday moratorium. FAA Holiday Moratorium:  No work shall be scheduled or take place during the week of and preceding and following:  the Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years Holidays.  Only emergency work to restore critical services to the facility will be considered and moratorium waiver must be submitted and approved.  The moratorium period will not be counted against the contract construction duration for the project.  The estimated contract price is from $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. The government contemplates award of a firm fixed price contract.   The project is full and open competition not set-aside in any manner.   III.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit (1) comments and questions relating to the development of a Statement of Work for Family and Juvenile Detention Services that incorporate best practices for residential management and service provision of children, youth, and families in minimally security, less than secure, and/or non-secure facility from within the competitive marketplace, whether governmental or commercial and (2) industry or governmental interest in providing such services, in the form of a Sources Sought synopsis for information purposes only.   This is not a solicitation announcement. Currently, no solicitation is available. This request for information does not commit the Government to pay any cost incurred in preparation of any submission to this Sources Sought Notice. The purpose of this request for information is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions

BACKGROUND:  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Office of Detention and Removal Operations, Juvenile and Family Residential Management Unit (JFRMU) sets juvenile and family detention policy and manages juvenile and family detention resources for individuals detained by ICE for administrative reasons.  This RFI is to assist ICE in providing children, as well as members of their family, with a safe and secure environment while in ICE custody.  When an adult with one or more minor children is detained, they may be placed in an ICE family residential facility.  This enables families to stay together to the greatest extent possible rather than separating children from their parents.  The goal of ICE family residential facilities is to maximize other available detention space and contain costs associated with the detention of non-criminal aliens including family units who are awaiting adjudication and/or removal from the United States. ICE provides safe, secure, and humane services in a residential setting. ICE has determined that maintenance of a family unit in a least restrictive setting is necessary to enforce specified provisions of immigration law.  

The standard operating procedure when an alien is ordered to be placed is detention: the alien is transported from the point of arrest to a processing center or a Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) field office.  During processing, identification and paperwork on the alien are completed, personal belongings are documented, and a detention or residential facility is designated as the most appropriate housing option.  The alien is then transported to the appropriate detention or residential facility.   

All responders are advised that the following considerations must be addressed in the family residential facility:  Compliance with applicable state child welfare laws and regulations and all state and local building; fire, health and safety codes; suitable living accommodations, food and appropriate clothing and personal grooming items; least restrictive environment with detained adults on the premises; appropriate routine medical and dental care, emergency health care services including a complete medical examination within 48 hours of admission excluding weekends and holidays for juveniles and within 14 days for adults; appropriate immunizations for juveniles; administration of prescribed medications; educational instruction for juveniles of school age Monday through Friday in basic academic competencies; recreational and leisure activities; access to religious services; visitation with family members not detained at the facility; phone access; maintenance and safety of confidential case records.  Additionally, all responders must address how any requirement for state residential license to provide child residential, group, or foster care, if needed, would be handled by their proposal.

This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or an obligation on the part of the ICE. Responses to this notice are not an offer and cannot be accepted by ICE to form a binding contract.  ICE does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses or otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the use of such information. All information received as a result of this RFI that is marked proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses will not be acknowledged or returned. Respondents may be invited to make an oral presentation to ICE concerning their response to this RFI.  As a result of this RFI, ICE may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an additional RFI. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against ICE shall arise as a result of a response to this RFI or the use of such information either as part of the evaluation process or in developing the specifications for any subsequent requirement. SUBMISSIONS: Respondents may provide - but are not limited to providing - the following information: (1) a statement indicating interest and capability to perform the required tasks; (2) a statement describing the respondent's proposed technical approach to the identified tasks; (3) suggestions regarding best means of providing for adequate family and juvenile care in an administrative detention setting; (4) suggestions for an appropriate schedule and/or development period; submitted materials should be submitted to ICE on or before July 23, 2007. Materials should be mailed to: Attention Susan Erickson, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Office of Acquisition Management, 425 I Street NW, Suite 2208, Washington, DC 20536.  Telephone questions/inquiries will not be accepted.  Please address all questions by e-mail to Susan.D.Erickson@dhs.gov.
  
Interested parties having the required physical plant to meet the above requirement should submit a capability statement to include the following: (1) Name and address of firm; (2) Size of business; (3) Average annual revenue for past three years; (4) Number of employees; (5) Ownership of firm; (6) Business size (large, small, disadvantage); (7) Number of years in business; (8) Affiliate information (parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor if potential sub, subcontractors if potential prime; and (9) List of customers covering the past five years (highlight relevant work performed, contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement, point of contact with address and phone number).

<DESC>JT3 LLC at Edwards Air Force Base (AFB), CA is seeking a vendor to perform a study to perform research and analysis to define the necessary hardware and software necessary to develop new and innovative approached for a high-accuracy High-Accuracy TSPI Sensor (HTS) system and corresponding software capable of providing a truth source for measuring the performance of future production systems.  No suitable existing sensor suite has been found, so new and innovative approaches are required involving both the hardware and software.  It is preferred that the HTS requirement be met by a system that does not rely on a ground infrastructure that is not easily and readily deployable to a new site.  For example, this preference might be satisfied by an onboard suite of Global Positioning System (GPS), inertial, and possibly other sensors, with high measurement rates, highly accurate relative timing, and perhaps redundant measurements, with a supporting infrastructure consisting of a single GPS reference receiver; however, the prospective sensor system is not constrained to any particular sensor type or technology.

Interested parties that would like to receive the Request for Proposal should contact Tillie Rivera at 661-277-9349 or email Tillie.Rivera.ctr@edwards.af.mil.

The cooling system shall be capable of achieving instrument required temperature control specifications when placed in a location fifty feet away from the instrument.  Appropriate plumbing shall be provided and included with installation. 

Vacuum System

The ICP/MS must include a triple stage vacuum system utilizing a turbo-molecular pump to maintain vacuum at less than 1e-5 Torr during analysis, includes vacuum chamber isolation valve which automatically closes as plasma is extinguished or when system faults occur.  The pumping system shall have enough capacity to reach operating vacuum from ambient atmosphere in less than 20 minutes.

In the event of vacuum failure, the entire vacuum system is to be automatically back-filled by inert gas to preserve the cleanliness of the system.

Turbo-molecular vacuum pump must be purged by an inert gas during operation to prevent damage by reactive gases and/or corrosive vapors.

Auto-sampler

The instrument package must include an auto-sampler with control software and sample dilution capability - Cetac model SDS 550 w/ASX 520, or equivalent.  The auto-sampler must have a completely metal free fluid path and its own peristaltic pump for supplying rinse to the sampling probe.  All available auto-sampler functionality must be controllable from the ICP/MS operating system.

Sample Introduction

The ICP/MS instrument must include an open architecture sample introduction system with the nebulizer and spray chamber mounted externally to the torch box / RF environment, for ease of access and maintenance.

A low pulsation, 3-channel peristaltic pump shall be supplied to allow for sample delivery, spray chamber drain pumping, and on-line addition of internal standards or diluent solvents.  At least one pump channel should be able to accept internal standard tubing.  The pump must be integrated into the main body of the system and must be located in close proximity to the nebulizer/spray chamber assembly in order to minimize sample uptake and washout time.  Full computer control of the peristaltic pump is required to allow for higher speed pumping during sample uptake and washout. Provision shall be included for the pump to automatically switch off upon completion of instrument analysis and instrument shutdown.

The ICP/MS sample introduction system must include a Peltier cooled, temperature controlled spray chamber.

The objective of this Sources Sought Notice is to seek information from vendors that have 
?	Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products to collect, analyze and report program and operational information, 
?	Demonstrable experience in the implementation of performance management systems. 
The propose solution must collect, analyze, and report the performance of SBA?s internal operations, programs, and major initiatives (projects) and support the preparation of public performance reports such as the PAR.  
Please note that this is a market survey for informational purposes only and is not a Solicitation.  There is no solicitation document available at this time; no contract will be awarded based on this announcement; and no reimbursement will be made for costs associated with responding to this announcement.  All responses must be submitted via e-mail in accordance with the instructions that follow.  

2.  DUE DATE:
July 9, 2007

3.   INTRODUCTION
The mission of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is to support the Nation?s economy by enabling the establishment and viability of new and existing small businesses and by assisting in the economic recovery of communities during disasters. Through an extensive network of field offices and partnerships with public and private organizations, SBA delivers its services to people throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, the U. S. Virgin Islands and Guam.
To carry out its mission, the SBA determines strategic objectives, which are established in the Agency?s Strategic Plan for FY 2006 through 2011.  The first three goals broadly define what the Agency and its programs are trying to accomplish and the fourth goal defines the responsibility of the Agency?s leadership and support functions to help accomplish the programmatic goals.  They are as follows: 

1.  	Improve the economic environment for small businesses;		
2.	Increase small business success by bridging competitive opportunity gaps facing entrepreneurs;
3.  	Restore homes and business affected by disaster; and
4. 	Ensure that all SBA programs operate at maximum efficiency and effectiveness by providing high quality executive leadership and support services.

SBA?s Strategic Plan is generally updated on a tri-annual basis and the strategic objectives may change from time to time.  A copy of SBA?s FY 2006 ? 2011 Strategic Plan may be viewed at http://www.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_strategic_plan_2006.doc

SBA is relying on an internally developed scorecard to manage and monitor key performance indicators and performance of major initiatives/projects.  Approximately 450 reporting users from 130 reporting entities spread over 100 geographical locations nationwide use this system. 
The actual performance against the key performance indicators for various programs are either manually input by the reporting users or derived from various systems like Mainframe, Sybase, Oracle, Access, Text files, Excel spread sheets etc. The milestones and actual cost and schedule performance for major initiatives/projects are maintained by the program managers across the Agency. This information is then reported to the Agency?s leadership. A subset of the performance information is published in public reports such as the annual Performance and Accountability Report (PAR).  The PAR may be viewed at http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/budgetsplans/SERV_ABTSBA_BUDGETS_PAR2006.html.  The current scorecard does not have sufficient and flexible reporting capabilities to support the Agency?s current and future needs. 
SBA is seeking options for leveraging or replacing its Scorecard.   Desired functionality includes:

o	Data Collection
o	Direct data entry of goals (indicators & targets), actual results, and comments
o	Direct data entry of project plans (milestones & budgets), actual results, and comments
o	Linkage to existing data sources 
o	Data entry from templates (e.g., MS Excel, MS Project)
o	Data Relationships
o	Create/ update/ manage relationships:
X	Organizational relationships between subordinate and superior reporting entities
X	Logical relationships along product lines, Agency-level goals, and Agency-level initiatives 
X	Reporting relationships; e.g., tagging metrics for selected internal and public reports
o	Data Analysis/Algorithms 
o	Calculation of variances between actual and targets (goals/indicators, project milestone dates and budgets)
o	Assignment of performance ratings (e.g., red, yellow, green)
X	Ability to vary rating criteria by goal or project
X	Ability to weight targets and/or actual performance for selected goals/indicators
o	Reporting
o	Presentation of performance scorecards by reporting entity
o	Summarization of performance data by organizational hierarchy, location, goal, initiative, product, performance status.
o	?Drill down? functionality from higher data aggregations to source records. 
o	Predefined reports
o	Ad hoc reporting
o	Time series
o	Environment
o	Approximately 125 reporting entities
o	Approximately 100 geographical sites nationwide
4.  INSTRUCTIONS
The SBA is interested in any creative or innovative solutions to this requirement.    
Responses to this Sources Sought Notice should:
1.	Include recommendations for how SBA should capture, analyze, and report data in a performance reporting dashboard.
2.	Describe how available COTS products can be used to collect data and implement a performance reporting dashboard at the SBA.  
3.	Provide up to three references for comparable projects completed on behalf of other government or non-profit organizations.

The University of Maryland (UMD) has been providing the Bureau of the Census (BOC) with a curriculum of courses specialized in the field of survey research and methodology since 1992.  The BOC has an ongoing need to attract and recruit top students in the field of survey research and methodology, as well as provide this field of study for selected, existing employees.  These services continue to be required to meet the BOC?s need for training professionals in the emerging interdisciplinary field of survey research and methodology.  The curriculum of courses offered is known as the Educational Services in Survey Methodology (ESSM).  ESSM meets the BOC need for training professionals in this field.  The ESSM program also meets the specific educational needs of the BOC, as the BOC annually supports well-qualified employees in the master?s and doctoral degree programs, in citation and certificate programs, and in various, professional short courses.  These programs and courses are designed so that participating individuals gain the maximum benefit from the combination of work experience at the Census Bureau and academic training.  Each of these programs has a different target audience.  The University of Maryland has the ESSM program as a part of its academic curriculum.  

The BOC intends to enter into a contract with the University of Maryland for educational services to include:  1) the enhancement of the ESSM curriculum through course development, 2) a compressed video teaching system  (to include all materials) and 3) maintenance of the curriculum of UMD courses specialized in the field of survey methodology.  

In addition, these educational services will serve the needs of BOC in survey research and methodology through graduate degree programs, certificate and citation programs, individual credit-bearing courses, and noncredit professional short courses.  These educational services shall be tailored to BOC specific requirements.  In addition, the UMD shall develop the academic field of survey methodology to enhance integrated theories and invent techniques to improve the quality of census and survey-based information. Annually, the UMD shall reserve contractually stated quotas for matriculation by current BOC employees.

The Contractor shall meet the requirements by performing the following:

?	Provide a director and faculty resources to provide classroom instruction for courses.  The director shall make day-to-day decisions regarding activities and services under this contract.  The director shall be responsible for the overall directions of the work under this contract.

?	Provide administrative and computing staff as necessary to meet the requirements of this contract.  The UMD shall process student administrative materials, prepare classroom materials, support the technical computing needs of the students, support the technical needs of the UMD compressed video teaching facility.

?	Provide consortium UMD management of the various university and corporate entities that provide faculty resources for this contract.  This involves active recruitment of other university campuses, and to the maximum UMD extent possible Minority Serving Institutions, in order to enrich the faculty resources for teaching graduate courses and professional short courses, allocation of staff to various courses, and management of the financial support for those activities.

?	Provide office and classroom space that consists of faculty, staff, and research assistant offices, a computer laboratory, seminar and work group meeting rooms, and requisite storage space.

?	Provide a compressed video classroom at the UMD containing the following or its equivalent:

	 	?	ITU H.320 compliant video system using Tandberg brand codec capable of sending and receiving ?duo video? (two live video sources simultaneously via ISDN or Ethernet (Internet Protocol [IP])

		?	A classroom with sufficient space for 30 students.

The UMD shall annually offer at least 25 semester-length graduate courses in survey methodology each year, including a survey practicum UMD on a topic proposed by the BOC, BEA, Bureau of Justice, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, EIA, NASS, NCES, NCHS, National Science Foundation, SSA, SO/IRS. These courses will be sufficient to fulfill the requirements for citation programs in survey statistics and in survey design, and for M.S. and Ph.D. programs in survey methodology.  Under the ESSM, the UMD shall construct new or modified graduate courses and proposed by the BOC.  Of the 25 courses offered each year, a minimum UMD of 10 shall contain the results of this collaborative effort (i.e., shall contain Census specific elements).  

The UMD shall develop, enhance, and maintain a minimum of UMD 10 professional short courses.  UMD shall organize an annual program of professional short courses on elementary, intermediate, and advanced topics in survey methodology.  The UMD shall recruit instructors for such non-credit courses, prepare teaching materials, administer registrations, and evaluate the performance of instructors and students. UMD shall continue with the citation programs based on an assembly of such courses. 

?	Expand the national consortium of UMD graduate programs in survey methodology to include additional universities.  Through such collaboration the UMD shall enrich faculty strengths and course offerings by forming these ties with other universities.

?	Improve the relevancy of the academic UMD curriculum.  The content will vary over time.  There are two reasons for change over time.  The first concerns the rapidly changing scientific literature that offers teaching material for the classes. The second concerns assessing the needs of the BOC students who are participants in the classes.

?	Provide on-site courses via compressed video transmission for Census staff.  The UMD shall work with the BOC to facilitate this training, coordinate relevant components with other courses and, when judged mutually advantageous, assist BOC experts in teaching selected components of this training.  This collaboration will further the application of theoretical results in survey methodology to BOC survey operations.

?	Continue to conduct a national competition for junior fellows that selects at least 30 students per year.  The UMD shall advertise the program on campuses throughout the US, maintain a web page of information on the program, administer a web-based application process, and organize a national faculty selection board.

<SUBJECT>65 -- High Resolution Microarray-Based Subtyping of Clostridium botulinum Using Maskless Array Synthesis Technology
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Nimblegen Systems, Inc., 1 Science Court, Madison, WI 53711, for high-resolution microarray-based subtyping of Clostridium botulinum. The vendor utilizes maskless array synthesis technology in order to generate microarrays with large probes (up to 70-mer) in a high density format (up to 390,000 features). The technology also allows the vendor to synthesize new array design within a day. The Botulism Public Health Research and Preparedness Unit (BPHRPU) is currently investigating the genotypic diversity among C. botulinum strains in their culture collection in order to develop improved subtyping methods. Strains will be compared within the collection with that of the genome sequenced strain, C. botulinum Hall type A strain using a comparative genome hybridization technique followed by re-sequencing arrays of regions that permit discrimination among strains of C. botulinum. The vendor will be required to develop the microarray using 70-mer probes titled approximately every 20 base pairs. The entire ~4 megabase pair C. botulinum Hall type A strain will be represented on a single microarray to achieve ?? 90% coverage. Synthesized arrays will then be shipped to CDC for hybridization with genomic DNA and data derived from these experiments will be used to generate re-sequcncing arrays which will enable all the DNA sequencing of up to 48,000 bases to be determined from a single array. The vendor will also be required to design and synthesize the microarrays and provide technical/bioinformatics assistance. BPHRPU requires the ability to change the chip design during the study. To allow this flexibility in chip design, it is required that maskless array synthesis technology be used to synthesize the microarrays. Nimblegen was the only company identified that utilizes maskless array synthesis technology and therefore has the flexibility to change the array design within 24 hours. In addition, technology developed by Nimblegen will permit BPHRPU to design and generate resequencing microarrays of specific regions of genomic DNA that may provide useful subtyping information.CDC believes that this requirement is met by only one provider. This procurement will be processed under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 and 6.302-2. Only one responsible source and no other sources will satisfy agency requirements. No solicitation is being issued. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. This procurement is not set-aside for small business. For contractual questions contact Linda M. Young.

<SUBJECT>R -- Global Monitoring for Variant Strains of HIV in Cameroon
<DESC>lobal Monitoring for Variant Strains of HIV in Cameroon 

In accordance with 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302(1), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to issue a sole-source, cost reimbursement (no fixed fee) modification under contract 200-2003-02506  to the incumbenant contractor Care and Health Program (CHP) in Yaounde, Cameroon.  The original requirement was competed in June 2003 and awarded to CHP.  The original contract's main purpose and objective was to establish surveillance for the emergence of new HIV variants, improve diagnostics for HIV variants, and search for other emerging retroviruses.

The extension modification will allow Care and Health Program's staff to work until the end of the fiscal year for continuation and consistency of the Global Monitoring for Variant Strains of HIV in Cameroon project.  It is imperative to use CHP for these services because they have been working on it since its inception.  Care and Health has history that includes knowledge of the community and program protocols, as well as their established networks with program participants and local officials. CHP?s ability to continue the work they have started will provide a cost savings to the government by preventing this research from ending prematurely.   By having CHP continue this work, the study will continue uninterrupted and will provide a substantial cost savings to the Government by having to restart or delay costly aspects of the project.

Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the services.  The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please send your documentation to Paul Drake at the office identified above, by fax (770) 488-2688 or email to fzj0@cdc.gov.  Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC.  A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within discretion on of the government.

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  

United States Central Command (USCENTCOM) CCJ6, 8410 Marina Bay Drive, Tampa, FL, 33621-5101, requires the upgrade, continued support and maintenance of the Owl Computing Technologies Secure Directory File Transfer System.  The 6th Contracting Squadron intends to make an award to Owl Computing Technologies (OCT), 38 A Grove St, Suite 101, Ridgefield, CT 06877-4664.  OCT is the manufacturer and sole proprietor of the Secure Directory File Transfer System.  Interested parties may e-mail matthew.keith@macdill.af.mil or fax 813-828-5111, SSgt Matthew Keith, not later than Monday, 2 July 2007, 9:00 a.m. EST.

Per FAR Part 5.207-13(e) Fed Biz Ops Numbered Note 22 applies and is modified to read:    

22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within ten days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY) 

The OCT Secure Directory File Transfer System is a data transfer system impervious to software and hardware attack.  The OCT Secure Directory File Transfer System meets the National Security Agency (NSA) Evaluation Assurance Level 4 (EAL 4) standard and is authorized for use on USCENTCOM secure networks.  The OCT Secure Directory File Transfer System provides a one way trust nothing controlled interface for any isolated security enclaves preventing any possibility of data leakage.  Throughout the Department of Defense (DoD) intelligence community the OCT Secure Directory File Transfer System is considered Internet Protocol (IP).  To purchase another system would require the approval of NSA.  In addition, it would mean forfeiting a system currently valued over $200K and absorbing the costs and efforts involved in procuring and implementing another system (i.e., approvals, new system cost, time to employ new system, and training of personnel).  It is not reasonable nor would it be cost effective to purchase another system when it too would require upgrades, continued support, and maintenance.

<SUBJECT>A -- Optical RF Combined Link Experiment Communication Adjunct (ORCA) Proposers' Day Conference
<DESC>PROPOSERS' DAY CONFERENCE
DARPA will host a Proposers' Day Conference in support of the Optical RF Communication Adjunct (ORCA) program on 11 July 2007 at George Mason University, Arlington Campus Professional Center, 3401 North Fairfax Drive, Room 329, Arlington, VA; beginning at 8:00am and lasting until 5:00pm.  The purpose of this Conference is to provide information on the ORCA effort, promote additional discussion on this topic, address questions from potential proposers, and provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.  

PROGRAM OBJECTIVE AND DESCRIPTION  
ORCA is the Son of the Optical RF Combined Link Experiment (ORCLE).  This effort restructures ORCLE to meet a new customer requirement that requires aircraft operation in a more challenging atmospheric environment located at 25, 000ft MSL.  The ORCA program seeks to design, build and test a secure hybrid electro-optical/radio-frequency, IP (Internet Protocol) based, communication system for tactical reach-back applications.  There is a need for high capacity links for tactical applications due to the increasing use of video and the aggregation of low rate data sources from forward areas for transmission to Tactical Operations Centers.  This aggregated information is placing increasing demands on the throughput of current RF systems and RF satellite links.  In addition, increasing commercial demands on satellite links and radio-frequency (RF) spectrum requires the incorporation of optical communication capability to relieve RF congestion and more efficiently use allocated RF capacity for the most critical traffic.  The objective of this effort is a prototype demonstration between a ground-based moving node to an aircraft loitering 50km distant and flying at 25,000 feet above mean sea level (MSL).  One aircraft relays information to another aircraft flying at 25,000 feet MSL and at a distance of 200km (124 miles) and may also be 50km from a fixed ground station with connectivity to a ground network.  The objective is to finish the program with a level six Technology Readiness Level (TRL-6) system and provide a leave behind capability for any potential users of this equipment.

This effort is divided into three phases.  The objective of Phase 1 is a mountaintop to mountaintop, air to mountaintop, and mountaintop to valley-floor series of tests culminating with a Preliminary Design Review (PDR).  The preliminary design effort shall consist of design and engineering of a hybrid Free Space Optics/Radio Frequency (FSO/RF) high capacity data link and network system.  This effort shall include, but shall not be limited to, performance studies, modeling and simulation of the system and its components and the development of a System Requirements Document.  Furthermore, a System Concept analysis shall be performed resulting in the production of a System Concept Document to be presented at the PDR.  During this phase the contractor should also propose a series of wind tunnel test with the objective to validate the performance and operating environment impact on the perspective system.  This should include the wind tunnel test plan, expected results, and metrics on results and comparisons to theory and prior research.  Also, the proposer should provide Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) studies on the dome and window configurations and a plan for test and result reporting.  Construction and test of a prototype breadboard system in the Phase 1 objective environments shall precede the PDR.  The construction of hardware shall include, but shall not be limited to, one breadboard ground terminal, one breadboard air terminal, and replacement parts for both air and ground terminals.  The PDR experiments can be accomplished in sequence over several events.  The contractor shall integrate and test these terminals to assure they meet specifications and present results of ground tests and design impacts at PDR. 

The objective of Phase 2 is an air to air, mountaintop to mountaintop, air to mountaintop, and mountaintop to valley-floor series of tests culminating with a Critical Design Review (CDR).  The contractors shall perform higher level engineering on the hybrid reach-back system and sub-systems.  Phase 2 efforts shall include, but shall not be limited to, the creation of a prototype System Design, leading into a mid-phase System Design Review (SDR).  

The objective of Phase 3 is to manufacture, integrate, interface, and test the hybrid reach-back system in a limited user experiment.  The objective is to finish Phase 3 with a TRL-6 quality system demonstration.  Phase 3 efforts include but are not limited to the generation of Flight and Ground Test Plans, Operating Manuals, Interface Control Documents, support for Flight Readiness Reviews, Technical Review Boards, and Safety Review Boards, as well as documentation, fabrication, and test of prototype equipment for ground and aircraft installation and test.

The specific objectives of all Phases of the ORCA program will be presented at the Proposers' Day meeting.

DARPA currently plans to solicit proposals for all Phases of the program at this time.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support Division (PS)  provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation  Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

DCHA staff in Sudan work as part of the USAID Mission in Sudan.  All DCHA staff, including OFDA, the Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), fall under the overall management of the DCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor based in Khartoum.  The Senior Humanitarian Advisor oversees all DCHA assistance to Sudan, including the Northern and Southern Sudan provinces, Darfur, and areas covered under the East Sudan Peace Agreement.
The Program Officer (PO) will support OFDA programs and situation reporting for Darfur, but may be called upon to cover needs in non-Darfur Sudan or Eastern Chad, as needed and determined by the DCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor in Sudan, and by OFDA/Washington.  The PO for Sudan exchanges information regularly with colleagues covering Southern and Northern Sudan portfolios, as well as with OFDA's Sudan Team in Washington D.C.  S/he works with a small team of experienced foreign national staff.  Security permitting, the Program Officer will travel to Darfur to assess, evaluate and monitor conditions at sites of OFDA projects, and make programmatic recommendations for interventions to the Darfur Field Office (DFO) Team Leader and to OFDA/Washington.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires a Program officer for Darfur in order to meet its objectives of programming, monitoring and evaluating OFDA programs in Darfur. 

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The PO will serve as a primary point of contact for OFDA implementing partners working in Darfur and will monitor, evaluate and report on OFDA-funded programs while helping to coordinate with other DCHA-funded programs.   This position requires substantial daily coordination with several DCHA staff members, representatives from other USAID offices, and the humanitarian community, therefore requiring a highly collaborative work style.  The PO must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team, a DART, a RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.  

The PO's responsibilities are:

* Serve as one of the principle contact points for OFDA in the Darfur region for humanitarian issues, and serve as a liaison on program issues among the field offices, the DCHA Team in Khartoum, and OFDA/Washington.
* Coordinate with OFDA Darfur Field Officers on all issues relating to the humanitarian community and OFDA programs in Darfur.
* Lead efforts to identify and assess humanitarian assistance requirements, target groups and locations, and existing relief programs, and recommend the types of interventions and budget levels necessary for OFDA's programs in Darfur.  
* Monitor ongoing programs and the overall humanitarian assistance picture in Darfur.  Regularly review partner's reports, coordinate with the Sudan Team in Washington on issues of mutual interest, and provide coordinated Washington and field feedback to the partners.
* Coordinate closely with the Darfur Field Office, the OFDA Sudan team in Washington, and UN and NGO agencies working in the field office's area of responsibility (AOR).
* Coordinate collection of information from all Darfur Field Officers and provide updates and recommendations through written reports to the Darfur Team Leader on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o the capacity and level of activity of indigenous structures to carry out relief programs;
o the capacity and ability of UN, IOs, and NGOs to carry out programs;
o the capacity of the logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o the security situation of personnel, convoys, and relief operations in general;
o the impact of Sudanese government activities on humanitarian programs; 
o the contributions by other donors, problems arising on implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of DCHA; and 
o humanitarian coordination issues and any recommendations for change.
* Provide guidance to organizations that are developing proposals for OFDA, based on OFDA's "Updated Guidelines for Unsolicited Proposals and Reporting." Review concept papers and proposals and provide timely recommendations/comments to the Darfur Team Leader and OFDA/Washington.
* Represent OFDA perspectives to NGOs, IOs, and UN agencies relating to humanitarian assistance strategies and priorities, including OFDA's approach to humanitarian protection.  Work closely with OFDA/Washington to discuss and understand sectoral priorities.
* Visit OFDA-funded projects on a regular basis, as security permits, and report on a timely basis to the Darfur Team Leader and the OFDA Sudan team in Washington on the quality of grantees' work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions.  
* Represent USG humanitarian interests at national and international meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues.
* Maintain daily liaison with UN, NGOs, IOs, the Government of Sudan, the Humanitarian Aid Commission, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
* Maintain regular, close coordination and communication with the DFO Team in Sudan and the OFDA Sudan Team in Washington.  
* Contribute to field reports on trends, individual agency programming issues, and topics such as humanitarian protection and coordination.
* Submit situation reports, assessment reports and end of tour report whenever necessary.
* Operate OFDA communications equipment.  May be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.
* Assist U.S. Embassy staff with humanitarian assistance matters as required.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:

The Program Officer will report directly to the Darfur Team Leader or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:

Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The supervisor provides administrative direction in terms of broadly defined missions or functions.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and perform with minimal direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of the DFO.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS
The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT
Work is primarily performed in an office setting, with frequent field visits to program sites.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) is the office within USAID that is responsible for providing non-food humanitarian assistance in response to international crises and disasters.  OFDA is part of the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) and is organized into three divisions under the management of the Office of the Director.  The Program Support Division (PS) provides programmatic and administrative support including budget/financial services, procurement planning, contracts and grants administration, and communication support for OFDA's Washington and field offices.  The Disaster Response and Mitigation Division (DRM) is responsible for coordinating with other organizations for the provision of relief supplies and humanitarian assistance.  DRM also devises, coordinates, and implements program strategies for a variety of natural and human caused disaster situations. DRM hires sector specialists to provide technical expertise in assessing the quality of disaster response.  The Operations Division (OPS) develops and manages logistical, operational, and technical support for disaster responses and administrative support to all offices and operations.  OPS maintains readiness to respond to emergencies through several mechanisms, including managing Search and Rescue Teams (SAR), Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs), and Washington-based Response Management Teams (RMTs).

INTRODUCTION

DCHA staff in Sudan work as part of the USAID Mission in Sudan.  DCHA staff in Khartoum include representatives from OFDA, the Office of Food for Peace (FFP) and the Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI), who fall under the overall management of the DCHA Senior Humanitarian Advisor (SHA) based in Khartoum.  The Field Officer (FO) will support DCHA programs and situation reporting for Darfur, but may be called upon to cover needs in non-Darfur Sudan or Eastern Chad, as needed and determined by the SHA in Khartoum, Sudan and OFDA/Washington.  The FO exchanges information regularly with colleagues covering Southern and Northern Sudan portfolios, as well as with OFDA's Sudan program team in Washington D.C.  S/he works with a small team of experienced foreign national staff.  The Field Officer travels frequently to assess, evaluate and monitor conditions at sites of OFDA projects, and makes strategic recommendations for interventions to the DFO Team Leader.

OBJECTIVE

OFDA requires a Field Officer in order to meet its program objectives of monitoring and evaluating DCHA programs in Darfur and reporting on the humanitarian situation. 

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Under the supervision of the Darfur Team Leader, and in coordination with other DCHA Sudan Team staff, the FO will serve as a primary point of contact for OFDA in the field and will monitor, evaluate and report on DCHA-funded programs.  The FO will be required to supervise and oversee the operations of the assigned field office including Sudanese national staff.  This position requires substantial daily coordination with several DCHA staff members, as well as representatives from other USAID offices and the humanitarian community, and therefore requires a highly collaborative work style.  The FO must be prepared to function effectively in a challenging and restrictive work environment and be willing to strictly adhere to U.S. Embassy security guidelines.  The incumbent may be required to serve as a critical component of a U.S. Government (USG) disaster assessment team, a DART, a RMT, or to backfill other staff members in the overseas office.  Foreign language ability in Arabic is preferred.  Strong verbal and written skills are critical for this position.

The Field Officer's responsibilities will include the following:

* Provide expert technical advice to the DCHA Sudan Team and DCHA's Washington-based offices on humanitarian needs and program activities in the area of responsibility (AOR).
* Visit and evaluate DCHA-funded project sites in the AOR on a regular basis, as security permits.  Report to DCHA on the quality of the grantee's work, noting deficiencies, attributes and evolving operational conditions.
* Monitor food, logistics, infrastructure, health, water, and sanitation conditions, as well as non-governmental organization (NGO) and local organizational capacities, and the role of the United Nations (UN) in providing humanitarian assistance to the region.
* Analyze and provide regular reporting on issues related to the humanitarian situation, including the following:
o the capacity, ability and level of activity of existing indigenous institutions to carry out relief programs;
o the capacity and ability of the UN, donor governments, and NGOs to support or implement programs;
o the capacity of local logistics infrastructure to support programs;
o security situation impacts on personnel, convoys, and relief operations as they affect humanitarian activities; 
o problems or concerns in implementation of relief programs, and any other issues that require the attention of DCHA; and
o overall coordination effectiveness and any recommendations for change.
* Assist NGOs, International Organizations (IOs), and UN agencies that are developing proposals to ensure their compliance with "OFDA's Guidelines for Proposals and Reporting," and review concept papers and proposals, providing recommendations/comments to OFDA for final funding determination.
* Participate in coordination with the donor community on policy issues affecting humanitarian operations, and develop integrated, non-duplicative programs in the AOR.  When delegated the authority by the Team Leader, the FO will represent the USG in relevant meetings and conferences, and facilitate, as requested, travel and briefings for official USG visitors interested in humanitarian issues. 
* Work without direct Team Leader supervision for extended periods of time.
* Participate with implementing partners, key staff from the DCHA Sudan Team in Khartoum, and members of OFDA's Sudan program team in Washington, D.C. in setting priorities and implementing policies.
* Identify and assess the humanitarian assistance requirements of the affected populations, including information on vulnerable groups, their locations, and existing relief programs, and make recommendations for the types of interventions necessary.
* Coordinate closely with the DCHA Team in Khartoum and other field offices, and maintain a daily liaison with UN agencies, IOs, NGOs, and other organizations regarding humanitarian activities.
* Collect and consolidate emergency humanitarian information and provide it on a regular basis via field notes, cables, and verbal reporting to the Information Officer in Khartoum.  Submit situation reports, assessment reports and end of tour report.
* Under the guidance of the Administrative Officer, the FO will be required to provide day-to-day supervision for locally engaged staff, help provide some administrative oversight at the field office level, and help to coordinate travel itineraries for very important persons.
* Operate OFDA communications and data processing equipment, including satellite telephones, cellular type mobile phones, and hand held radios.  
* May be required to operate a four-wheel drive, standard shift vehicle in cross-country conditions.
* Assist U.S. Embassy staff with humanitarian assistance matters.

SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:
The Field Officer will report directly to the Darfur Team Leader or his/her designee.

SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:
Supervisory controls will be minimal.  The supervisor provides administrative direction in terms of broadly defined missions or functions.  The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and perform with minimal direction in responding to humanitarian emergencies as part of the DCHA Sudan Team.

10.  PHYSICAL DEMANDS

The work is generally sedentary and does not pose undue physical demands.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, there may be some additional physical exertion including long periods of standing, walking over rough terrain, or carrying of moderately heavy items (less than 50 pounds).

11.  WORK ENVIRONMENT

Work is primarily performed in an office setting with frequent field visits to program sites.  During deployment on Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DARTs) (if required), and during site visits, the work may additionally involve special safety and/or security precautions, wearing of protective equipment, and exposure to severe weather conditions.

<DESC>This proposed procurement is a follow-on for an independent assessment of NASA space vehicle accidents associated with the use of radioactive materials onboard the NASAs Mars Science Laboratory 2009 (MSL-09) Mission.	 The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Dr. Marvin Goldman.  Professor Goldman is an internationally recognized expert in the health effects associated with radioactive materials.	He has been a consultant to NASA providing this unique expertise in the areas of INSRP biomedical and environmental (BEES) review of these space nuclear missions, including the recent New Horizons-Pluto, Cassini, and Galileo project.  His expertise is in the health and environmental effect of long-lived radionuclides, especially plutonium, including toxicology, cancer risk, radioecology, internal dosimetry and general radiation risk assessment.   Dr. Goldmans expertise in the area of biomedical and environmental review makes him uniquely qualified to perform this effort. To try and duplicate this effort is not feasible given the types of experience necessary and the time allotted for this effort to be performed. It is in the best interest of the government to continue with the current contactor because of duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. NASA/HQ intends to award a purchase order for continued performance of specialized services to Dr. Marvin Goldman Consultant.  The authority is FAR 6.302-1 (a)(2)(iii)(A) "only one responsible source. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing, by FAX or E-Mail, to the identified point of contact not later than 12:00 p.m. local time on June 29, 2007. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  FAX or E-Mail any inquiries to the identified point of contact. All responsible sources may submit their qualifications which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

Inspection an Acceptance:

NIST will perform accuracy measurement performance acceptance tests for translation and rotation along three orthogonal axes XYZ in our laboratories.
Since there are no standard tests available, NIST will use our Government-owned nano positioners http://www.isd.mel.nist.gov/meso_micro/ to perform these tests.
NIST?s devices have the lowest cross talk and angular deviation errors of any devises of the same size and range of motion and have embedded cap gages with their axes aligned with the actuator axes, which can measure displacement with great accuracy and resolution.
NIST will measure the angular deviations with autocollimators.
In order to facilitate the performance of these tests NIST will attach a target of known dimensions on the moving stage.  The target will be a single crystal rectangular piece of silicon of dimensions 340 micrometers x 340 micrometers. 
The desired characteristics for a magnification of 20X are the following:
X axis (Horizontal translation), accuracy error less than 1 micrometer and sigma less than 20 nanometers.
Y axis (Horizontal translation), accuracy error less than 1 micrometer and sigma less than 20 nanometers.
Z axis (Vertical translation), accuracy error less than 1 micrometer and sigma less than 2 nanometers.
X axis (rotation), accuracy error less than 5 microradians and sigma less than 1 microradian.
Y axis (rotation), accuracy error less than 5 microradiansand sigma less than 1 microradian.
Z axis (rotation), accuracy error less than 5 degrees and sigma less than 1 degree.
The performance will be measured at two frequencies, quasi static 0 Hz and sinusoidal oscillation of 20 Hz.

The speed of the pump shall be varied to maintain a pump discharge pressure of 60 psig. The pressure switch on the suction side of the booster pump will turn the pump off when the pressure  increases to 50 psig.  If the local water service pressure falls to 10 psig, the booster pump will be stopped to prevent the pump from cavitating if the suction pressure is too low.  The emergency water well will be manually operated.  This will be turned  on when the water pressure is considered to be low.

The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-12
HOMELAND SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE-12 (HSPD-12) IMPLEMENTATION

FAR Clause 52.204-9	Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel.

As prescribed in 4.1301, insert the following clause: 
Personal Identity Verification of Contractor Personnel (Nov. 2006) 
(a) The Contractor shall comply with agency personal identity verification procedures identified in the contract that implement Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12), Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance M-05-24, as amended, and Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB) Number 201, as amended.
(b) The Contractor shall insert this clause in all subcontracts when the subcontractor is required to have routine physical access to a Federally-controlled facility and/or routine access to a Federally-controlled information system. 
(End of clause)

Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12) (September 2006)

In response to the general threat of unauthorized access to federal facilities and information systems, the President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive-12 (HSPD-12).  HSPD-12 requires all Federal agencies to use a common Personal Identity Verification (PIV) standard when identifying and issuing access rights to users of Federally-controlled facilities and/or Federal Information Systems.  USAID will begin issuing HSPS-12 "smart card" IDs to applicable contracts, using a phased approach.  Effective October 27, 2006, USAID will begin issuing new "smart card" IDs to new contractors (and new contractor employees) requiring routine access to USAID controlled facilities and/or access to USAID's information systems.  USAID will begin issuance of the new smart card IDs to existing contractors (and existing contractor employees) on October 27, 2007.  (Exceptions would include those situations where an existing contractor (or contractor employee) loses or damages his/her existing ID and would need a replacement ID prior to October 27, 2007.  In those situations, the existing contractor (or contractor employee) would need to follow the PIV processes described below, and be issued one of the new smart cards.)

Accordingly, before a contractor (including a PSC* or a contractor employee) may obtain a USAID ID (new or replacement) authorizing him/her routine access to USAID facilities, or logical access to USAID's information systems, the individual must provide two forms of identity source documents in original form and a passport size photo.  One identity source document must be a valid Federal or state government-issued picture ID. (Overseas foreign nationals must comply with the requirements of the Regional Security Office.)  USAID/W contractors must contact the USAID Security Office to obtain the list of acceptable forms of documentation, and contractors working in overseas Missions must obtain the acceptable documentation list from the Regional Security Officer.  Submission of these documents, and related background checks, are mandatory in order for the contractor to receive a building access ID, and before access will be granted to any of USAID's information systems.  All contractors must physically present these two source documents for identity proofing at their USAID/W or Mission Security Briefing.  The contractor or his/her Facility Security Officer must return any issued building access ID and remote authentication token to USAID custody upon termination of the individual's employment with the contractor or completion of the contract, whichever occurs first.

The contractor must comply with all applicable HSPD-12 and PIV procedures as described above, and any subsequent USAID or government-wide HSPS-12 and PIV procedures/policies, including any subsequent related USAID General Notices, Office of Security Directives and/or Automated Directives System (ADS) policy directives and required procedures.  This includes HSPD-12 procedures established in USAID/W and those procedures established by the overseas Regional Security Office.

In the event of inconsistencies between this clause and the later issued Agency or government-wide HSPD-12 guidance, the most recent issued guidance should take precedence, unless otherwise instructed by the Contracting Officer.

The contractor is required to include this clause in any subcontracts that require the subcontractor or subcontractor employee to have routine physical access to USAID space or logical access to USAID's information systems.

PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR ENVIRONMENTAL TEST CHAMBER.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer submitted questions and revise specification number 5. QUESTION 1:  As described in the above referenced solicitation, these chambers will be used to house lithium ion batteries during electrical testing. However, there is nothing in the specifications that indicate the requirement for safety related components to prevent an explosion inside of the chamber while these batteries are present. (COMPANY NAME) has a great deal of experience providing customers with chambers that have the safeties necessary to prevent this type of catastrophe. Some of these items include: Temperature Limited Sheath Heaters that are set below the auto-ignition temperature of any outgassed materials. Non Sparking Fans Explosion Proof Chamber Lighting (Or No Lighting at all) Nitrogen Purge is not a safe alternative since it can potentially trap combustible gas pockets inside the chamber. Any testing that is done using a potentially explosive product should be tested in a chamber that is rated to Class I, Division II explosion proof as defined in NEC Class I, Division 2 An area where ignitable gases or vapors are handled, processed or used, but which are normally in closed containers or closed systems from which they can only escape through accidental rupture or breakdown of such containers or systems. ANSWER 1: The test facility has safety controls and procedures in place to handle potential hazards related to Lithium-ion battery testing. QUESTION 2: RE: Specification No. 5 5. Should the temperature change rate from 23C to -40C in 12 minutes or less be calculated based on an empty chamber with no live load? ANSWER 2: Specification No. 5 is changed to read as follows: 5. Temperature change rate from 23 degrees C to - 40 degrees C of less than or equal to 24 minutes with no live load. Temperature change rate from 23 degrees C to 65 degrees C of less than or equal to 12 minutes with no live load.  The due date for receipt of offers is extended to 4:30 EST, June 29, 2007. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on June 18, 2007.

AMENDMENT 1: (Technical Question)

Question 1: 

I am working on a bid for the above referenced RFQ, there is a technical issue with how the specs are written - the height of the shelter is taller than the overall allowed height of the tower shown (7 feet).  We manufacture XXXXXXX Units for the military already - can we quote something standard for this application?

Answer 1: 

In response to the question above the Government does not feel that the specs are incorrect. As stated in the posting, the trailer must have an integrated weather-proof, climate controlled full enclosure measuring approximately 60? (length) x 76? (height) x 84? (height) for the operator and rack equipment. Therefore, both the fold over and shelter have approximate heights of 7 feet. 

Please note: that the ? after the numeric measurements stands for inches.
