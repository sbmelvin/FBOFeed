<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Anteon Corporation, 3211 Jermantown Road, Fairfax, Virginia 22030-2844 for the acquisition of thirty-six (36) AN/AQS-24 Container Upgrade Kits.  The AN/AQS-14A system is in the process of being upgraded to the AN/AQS-24 system via engineering change proposal (ECP) 143.  This upgrade will include a complete overhaul of the aircraft mounted components, the in-water components, and all necessary support equipment.   Therefore the shipping containers require modifications to correlate with the change in equipment.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The AN/AQS-14A storage containers that are currently in inventory will no longer be adequate to support the needs of the upgraded equipment.  The Anteon Corporation, the original equipment manufacturer of the containers, has developed an upgrade kit (Q-24 Container Upgrade;  P/N:  8Y603-2006241).  This kit !  will provide the necessary modifications to upgrade the current containers to be used by the fleet for the AN/AQS-24.  The Government does not own the drawings for the upgrade kit.  Therefore these upgrade kits are being acquired from Anteon Corporation.  FSC Code is 8145, NAICS Code is  541330, small business standard is $4.5M.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Aviation Ground Equipment Corp., 53 Hanse Avenue, Freeport, N.Y. 11520-4608 for the acquisition of one  Aircraft Ground Power Unit (Hobart) consisting of  one (1) 45SX200, 45KVA, power system (P/N 500048A-311), one (1) lightweight, AFV, towable Trailer (p/n 288294-001), and one (1) 30’ AC Cable Assembly (p/n 402034-2).  Collectively these three items are typically referred to as an Aircraft Ground Power Unit.  The Aircraft Ground Power Unit is required to provide in-hanger electrical power to the MH-60S aircraft currently at NSWC PC to support WSIT CT testing.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  There is a direct need to buy a system that is known to interoperate with both the MH-60S aircraft and the electrical power system of the NSWC PC hanger.  Technical information indicates that this is the only Aircraft Ground Power Unit will meet MH-60!  S interface requirements "off the shelf".  Use of another Aircraft Ground Power Unit may introduce or change existing parameters within the operating range of the MH-60S aircraft.  These changes could result in significant harm to aircraft personnel as well as damage to the aircraft.  Therefore, it is imperative that the Aircraft Ground Power Unit is acquired from Aviation Ground Equipment Corporation immediately.  NAICS Code is 336413, FSC Code is 6115, SBA Size Standard is 1000 employees.

Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 13, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.

The Laboratory Operations Division (LOD) is currently implementing a quality management system (QMS) based on the principles and requirements contained in ISO 17025.  ISO 17025 is a quality management standard equivalent to ISO 9000:2000, but with specific laboratory focus. Because a QMS shoud be an  integral part of the daily business processes, NVFEL is seeking a software tool that shall allow for increased efficiency and improved communication channels.  The software tool shall contain modules (or databases) based on an ISO quality system, have email capability, and be utilized to assist  workflow and follow-up.  Workflow is defined both within and between modules.

Software packages shall be commerical off-the-shelf  (COTS) with the ability to modify the software with the addition/deletion of modules.  Software packages which also contain modules that allows for audits, planning, risk assessment, deviations/non-conformances, customer concerns(complaints) and calibration tracking will receive preference by the  EPA.  The option to incorporate modules based on ISO 14000 Environmental System requirements and or OHSAS-1800 Safety and Health Management requirements is desirable.   The modules contained within the package shall be easily configurable by non-Information Technology personnel and should be  supplied with existing industry (or ISO accepted) forms and templates.  Delivery of this software package and selected option to NVFEL is expected within approximately 6 months or less.  Contractor may be requested to demostrate the functionality of software package.  Contractor must have all  approved licenses and agreements to modify the software if not owned by contractor.  Government will expected "unrestricted data rights " to the software purchased.

<DESC>F-22 multi-year procurement (Lots 7, 8 &9) to include Advanced Buy, Economic Ordering Quantity and Full Rate Production requirements.

This announcement constitutes a Notice Of Contract Action Synopsis.  The F-22 System Program Office (SPO), Aeronautical System Center (ASC), is planning for the F-22 full-rate production aircraft, associated equipment, and related support capabilities within a three-lot multi-year buy.  The F-22 blends low observability with advanced avionics, a highly maneuverable lightweight airframe, and supercruise performance.  Through its robust avionics suite and embedded air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities, this aircraft is designed to detect, engage, and destroy an opposing force before detection.  Since 1990, Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LM Aero), Marietta, GA, has been the prime contractor for the F-22 engineering, manufacturing, and development, as well as, the build of Production Representative Test Vehicles (PRTV), PRTV II, Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) Lots 1-5, and Full Rate Production Lot 6 aircraft.  Responsible sources are sought for the multi-year buy.  Offerors must provide written notice to the respective contracting officer of their interest and capability to satisfy the government requirement no later than 24 March 06.
 
The anticipated multi-year buy (60 aircraft) is a continuation of the F-22’s full rate production phase—with delivery dates beginning on/about February 2009 and continuing through December 2011.  The Request for Proposal will incorporate both economic price adjustment and variation in quantity clauses to maximize production flexibility.  The multi-year buy will, however, be capped at a maximum of 60 aircraft.

The response for the multi year buy, solicitation number TBD, should be concise, program specific and address all of the following prerequisites:  (1) possess program management, fabrication/assembly, and quality assurance personnel; (2) possess the material, engineering, factory and flight test equipment and physical facilities; (3) be a responsible contractor with demonstrated recent total aircraft system responsibility; (4) be capable of delivering qualified aircraft in accordance with the above schedule; and (5) include in their response this notice evidence of these capabilities.  Offerors shall also indicate their size status in relation to NAICS 336411.  Reprocurement data is not available, and the production specification will only be provided upon request.  

Inquiries about subcontracting opportunities should be directed to the Lockheed Martin Small Business Liaison Officer:  Ms. Vanessa Bull, 86 South Cobb Dr., D/088-4, Marietta GA, 30063-0510; Phone:  (770) 494-7215; e-mail:  Vanessa.y.bull@lmco.com

An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  To address concerns only, interested parties are invited to call ASC’s Ombudsman, Steven J. Miller, ASC/AE, 1755 Eleventh St., B750, Rm 113, Phone (937)-255-6005, or e-mail Stephen.miller@wpafb.af.mil  

If there are any questions with regard to this acquisition, please contact Paul Weikert, Contracting Officer, ASC/YFK, (937) 904-5255or paul.a.weikert@wpafb.af.mil. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information of responses submitted as the result of this solicitation.*****

The contract will be for the purchase of one hundred and twenty (120) F119-PW-100 install engines, fifteen (15) F119-PW-100 spare engines, initial spare parts and support equipment.  This action is a follow-on to Contract # FA8611-05-C-2851.  The F-22 SPO plans to issue the request for proposal in March 2006 and award a contract by April 2007.  

The offeror shall indicate their size status relative to NAICS 336411.  Reprocurement data is not available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting market research for patent application analysis tools for automating a wide range of common patent analysis tasks enabling users to analyze patent applications and extract meaningful information/intelligence. This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT. This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Strong relationships with industry are a priority of the USPTO, and the USPTO wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all organizations that choose to provide information in accordance with this information request. 
Background
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) with its headquarters presently located in Alexandria, Virginia. The mission of the USPTO is the examination and issuance of patents and the examination and registration of trademarks. The USPTO serves the interest of inventors and businesses with respect to their inventions and corporate products, and service identifications. It also advises and assists the bureaus and offices of the Department of Commerce and other agencies of the Government in matters involving intellectual property. 

Currently the USPTO databases house about 7 million patents and over 30 million documents comprising 19 terabytes of storage with 6,000 internal users and 1,500 concurrent public users. There is an ongoing need to examine patent applications, maintain patent quality, and perform patentability analysis.

ALL ANALYSIS TOOL VENDORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS RFI.  USPTO is considering multiple analysis tools to aid examiners.

<DESC>AMENDMENT#1 TO PR-NC-06-10284 IS ISSUED FEBRUARY 27, 2006.  THIS AMENDMENT IS ISSUED TO RE-SCHEDULE THE TIME OF THE PRE-SOLICITATION CONFERENCE FROM 1:00 PM TO 3:00 PM ON MARCH 9,2006 TO 2:00 PM TO 4:00 PM ON MARCH 9, 2006.The EPA has integrated its air toxics program into four components.  The first component is source specific regulatory programs.  The first component includes the development of MACT standards under section 112(d), MACT or generally available control technology (GACT) standards under 112(k), residual risk standards under 112(f), and other standards to regulate emissions of air toxics from specific sources.  The second component includes national, regional, and community-based initiatives on multi-media and cumulative risks, such as the Great Water Program and EPA?s persistent, Bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals (PBT) initiative.  The third component, National Air Toxics Assessments (NATA), will provide quantitative estimates of the health risks associated with air toxics on a variety of geographic scales ranging from  national-scale assessments to local-scale analyses.  The fourth and final component of EPA?s air toxics program is education and outreach.  As a result of this integration, the Environmental Protection Agency has a requirement to obtain contractor support for the Chemicals, Coatings, and Commerce Sectors.  The resulting contract will provide support for the first component, source specific regulatory programs.  The source specific regulatory component of the EPA's air toxics program includes the development of technology-based standards for both major and area sources, residual risk standards, as well as, other standards development activities.  In addition to supporting the development of standards which regulate the emission of air toxics from stationary sources, this requirement will provide support for developing stationary  source criteria pollutant standards.  These standards may take the form of either a New Source Performance Standard (NSPS), as defined in Section 111 of the CAA, or a standard based on "best available controls" (BAC), as defined in section 183(e) of the CAA or guidance documents, such as Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) documents, in lieu of a standard.  The tasks involved for this requirement will facilitate the process of developing or reviewing any of the types of standards or guidance documents discussed above or any other Federal rule mandated by the CAA or other Federal authority as it relates to support for pollutants in the chemicals, coatings, and commerce sectors. EPA anticipates the award of two cost-plus fixed fee level of effort type contracts (One contract is anticipated to be awarded on the basis of full and open  competition and one contract is anticipated to be awarded as a 100% small business set-aside).  The total duration of each proposed contract is fifty-seven (57) months consisting of a nine (9) month base period and four (4) additional twelve-month option periods.  The base quantity labor hours for each one of the proposed contracts will consist of 7,500 hours for the 9 month base period and 10,000 base quantity labor hours for each one of the option periods.  Each contract will also include additional optional quantity labor hours in the amount of 22,500 optional quantity labor hours for the base period and 30,000 optional quantity labor hours each one of the option periods for a total of 190,000 labor hours for each contract.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541620  with a size standard of 6.5 million.  This is an invitation to participate in a pre-solicitation conference.    The purpose of the conference is to provide background information concerning the Statement of Work (SOW) to potential offerors and to create an open forum for discussions concerning the objectives of the project.  Any and all questions submitted should be directly related to the DRAFT SOW and technical evaluation criteria.  There will be no discussion of budget at the conference or any other subject matter that does not directly pertain to the DRAFT SOW or technical evaluation criteria.  Both the draft statement of work and evaluation factors are available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.  The conference will be held on March 9, 2006 from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM at the EPA-RTP main campus.  A map and directions to EPA's Research Triangle Park, NC campus are located at EPA's website at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/. Confirmation of attendance and questions regarding the draft documents, must occur by 12:00 P.M. (EST) on March 03, 2006 via email to Laconda Cannady at cannady.laconda@epa.gov.  Please use "PR-NC-06-10284-Pre-solicitation Conference" as your subject line.  Telephone confirmations are not acceptable for this procurement.   Pre-solicitation conference attendance is limited to two (2) individuals that best represent the prospective offerors company.  Any questions and/or comments that you would prefer not to discuss in a group format due to proprietary reasons should be submitted in writing to Laconda Cannady via email no later than March 06, 2006 and explicitly labeled ?proprietary?.  EPA handling of such questions/comments and subsequent responses will be handled in accordance with normal agency procedures for protection of proprietary data.  There will be NO reimbursement for travel expenses related to the participation in the pre-solicitation conference.  All responses to questions/comments concerning the DRAFT SOW and technical evaluation criteria discussed at the pre-solicitation conference and not deemed proprietary will be compiled and distributed to all interested parties.  The RFP will be issued approximately April 26, 2006 and proposals will be due approximately thirty (30) calendar days after the RFP issuance date.  The solicitation and amendments will be available at http://www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd/.   If you obtain a copy of the solicitation via internet, it will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site where the solicitation is posted for any amendments.

<DESC>The Epidemiology Branch is one of three intramural Branches within the Division of Epidemiology, Statistics and Prevention Research at the National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD).  The Epidemiology Branch conducts original research on all aspects of reproductive, perinatal and pediatric epidemiology using a variety of study designs and methods.  

The Epidemiology Branch intends to empirically evaluate the relation between select environmental chemicals and the gynecologic disorders in the context of varying comparison groups.  The goal of this reproductive epidemiologic study is to identify environmental contaminants that may adversely affect gynecologic health with a particular focus on endometriosis.  The specific exposures of interest include persistent hormonally active environmental agents (e.g., polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbon chemicals such as PCBs), persistent organochlorine pesticides (OCs), and newly emerging persistent compounds (e.g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and perfluorinated chemicals (PFOS, PFOA).  Biomarkers of lifestyle factors purportedly associated with risk of endometriosis (e.g., cotinine, phytoestrogens) also will be assessed.  Menstruating women, aged 18-44 years (women at risk of developing endometriosis), of any racial/ethnic group comprise the target study population.  Although it is possible for men on hormonal therapy to develop and be diagnosed with endometriosis, the rarity of the condition among men and its appearance only in the presence of hormonal therapy makes their inclusion in this study impractical.  Likewise, minor girls are unlikely to eligible given that adolescents are rarely diagnosed because affected individuals generally do not undergo laparoscopy for several years following the onset of signs and symptoms.

The many complexities associated with the diagnosis of endometriosis (such as laparoscopic visualization with or without histologic confirmation and the selectiveness of women seeking gynecologic medical care in comparison to the target study population) pose methodologic challenges for assessing the etiology of endometriosis including environmental contaminants.  To this end, the two comparison groups of women will be studied to facilitate interpretation of the study results.   

Study participants will be sampled from women undergoing diagnostic/therapeutic laparoscopy or laparotomy.  To ensure sufficient power to detect differences in serum concentrations, approximately 850 women undergoing laparoscopy/laparotomy will need to complete the study protocol, of which half will comprise women with newly diagnosed endometriosis.  An additional 187 population controls also will be needed to serve as a second comparison group.  



The NICHD is soliciting proposals from qualified organizations that wish to serve as a site for the conduct of this study.  The NICHD anticipates that up to two sites will be needed to meet the overall recruitment goals.  Therefore, the NICHD plans on issuing up to two contract awards for 27-month completion-type contracts, with two separate Phases, for this procurement.    

Each site will be expected to successfully enroll and retain: 1) women in whom endometriosis is newly diagnosed either by laparoscopy or laparotomy; 2) women undergoing laparoscopy or laparotomy in whom no endometriosis is diagnosed including women undergoing tubal sterilization without underlying gynecologic disease; and 3) women randomly selected from the referent population for women in the laparoscopy/laparotomy cohort who report no history of endometriosis or other gynecologic disease.  

This procurement is defined as code 541710 under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).  It is anticipated that the RFP will be available on or about February 21, 2006 through the FedBizOpps website at http://FedBizOpps.gov.  

All proposals must be submitted on or before the due date and time stated in the RFP to: Gwennifer Epps, Contract Specialist, NICHD R&D Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-7510 (if sending by overnight carrier, use 6l00 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Rockville Maryland, 20852).

The Government does not intend to release hard copies of the RFP.  The Government also reserves the right to cancel this procurement at any time prior to contract award.  This announcement does not commit the Government to award a contract. Numbered Note 26 Applies.

<DESC>This Modification incorporates several corrections into the description and is therefor reprinted in its entirety. Washington Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to participate in a joint research project under a cost-shared subcontract with the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop critical technology for the Hybrid Sulfur (HyS) thermochemical cycle for the production of hydrogen.  The HyS Process is one of the baseline candidates identified by the U.S. Department of Energy for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen by using thermal energy from advanced nuclear reactors or solar central receivers.  It is a two-step hybrid cycle (one thermochemical reaction and one electrochemical reaction) that only involves sulfur, oxygen and hydrogen compounds.  Experimental work has begun on the sulfur dioxide depolarized electrolyzer, the major developmental component in the cycle.  Proof-of-concept tests have established proton-exchange-membrane (PEM) cells as a viable approach for conducting this reaction.  Further development of the HyS Process will require clear definition of the cost-effective electrolyzer performance targets, such as cell size, current density, cell resistance and long-term durability.  Fundamental material science is needed to develop PEM materials and microstructures that can achieve these performance targets.  A major technical requirement for the electrolyzer is the elimination or minimization of elemental sulfur formation caused by the crossover of sulfur dioxide from the anode to the cathode of the cell.  SRNL is seeking industry or academic partners to participate in cooperative research and development that would result in electrolyzer designs meeting these requirements.  Potential areas of research include membranes, membrane-electrode-assemblies, cell designs, and electrocatalysts.  SRNL expects to characterize and test the experimental membranes or other components in their existing electrolyzer test facilities.  The PEM concept using sulfur dioxide dissolved in concentrated sulfuric acid described herein is the baseline approach; however, alternative designs and innovative concepts will be considered and are encouraged.  It is expected that one or more companies will be selected to participate by performing work under cost-shared subcontracts with SRNL.  The initial period of performance is expected to be one year, with extensions for continued work dependent of the degree of success of the research.  Any company interested in participating in this research project must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than March 27, 2006, summarizing the company’s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Responses should be limited to not more than eight pages, including all attachments, and should clearly outline the area of research to be pursued and the planned approach.  Based on the responses, SRNL may issue one or more solicitations for competitive procurement.  Questions, requests for additional background information and expressions of interest should be addressed to Jack Simon, Savannah River National Laboratory, Building 999-W Room 348, Aiken, SC, 29808; via telephone at (803) 819-8420; via fax at (803) 819-8416; or via email at jack.simon@srnl.doe.gov. This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in collaborative research opportunities only.

<DESC>2006 Design-Bid-Build Brussels Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation Project

CHANCERY RENOVATION  QUALIFICATION ONLY 


THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE (DOS), Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) is seeking to pre-qualify firms for Design-Bid-Build construction services for the renovation of an existing office building, Bi-lateral Mission Chancery, Brussels, Belgium. The construction contract is expected to be awarded prior to September 30, 2006. Actually, construction is not expected to begin until issuance of a Notice to Proceed. Performance period of this project from Notice to Proceed issuance is anticipated to be 18 months. This project does require the use of cleared American workers. The contract type for this project will be firm fixed-price. Award of this contract is subject to the availability of funds. 



SALMEC-06-R0038: Brussels, Belguim, Chancery Renovation and Rehabilitation: 6,000 gsm, Estimated Bid Build cost range $10 to $15 million.

Background Information

This US Government owned Chancery, constructed by the Department in 1952 is situated on a one-third acre lot.  The 6,000 gsm Chancery is comprised of a seven-story "tower" portion on Boulevard du Regent and a two-story back wing which abuts the CMR. The building forms a "U" shape around a paved interior courtyard and a full basement extends under the entire floor plate of the building including the tower, low wing and courtyard.  This level was originally constructed as a parking garage; evidence of the irregular column spacing and ramps still exist.  A sub-basement was built under the tower portion of the building, which is comprised of the building's mechanical services.

The entire building, with the exception of the top floor was constructed with cast-in-place concrete columns, beams, joists, floor and roof slabs.  The top floor of the tower is framed with structural steel, which is roofed with a concrete slab. The exterior walls of the Chancery are clad with flat (French) limestone panels set in a stacked pattern.  The original aluminum (double insulated glass) windows are set in punched openings.

Project Solicitation

THE PROJECT SOLICITATION WILL CONSIST OF TWO PHASES. This announcement for pre-qualification is Phase I. The Department of State will evaluate and rate the pre-qualification proposals based on the evaluation criteria set forth in the following Pass/Fail Evaluation Factors. Those offerors receiving a satisfactory evaluated rating from the technical board will be issued a formal solicitation (Request for Proposal) and invited to submit proposed pricing in Phase II. The government reserves the right not to pre-qualify any offeror receiving less than a satisfactory rating in any evaluation factor or sub-factor. 

Prior Prequalification

	Prequalifications were done for the NEC projects in Johannesburg, Sarajevo, Harare,  Brazzaville, Libreville, Surabaya, Djibouti, Ouagadougou and Antananarivo and Beirut. Firms found prequalified for the specific individual projects listed in the previous sentence may prequalify for this project by submitting a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. Design build firms that submitted a prequalification package for SED design-build projects of similar scope and dollar value during FY 2005 and were successfully pre-qualified by the OBO technical panel need not resubmit a complete pre-qualification package under this announcement. If interested, the previously pre-qualified offerors must send the POC a letter of interest as described below prior to the closure date of this solicitation. 
	
         Letter of Interest:  The letter must be submitted in accordance with  the previous paragraph. However, if any changes have occurred in the construction firm's structure, size status, or team of the construction aspect of the offeror's original design-build pre-qualification package, the offeror must identify the change(s) in the letter for the government to review and evaluate. The government will determine if such changes are acceptable.  Offerors must ensure that they cite the RFP number of the previous pre-qualification solicitation and what specific changes were made since pre-qualification. A change by the contractor must be sent for evaluation to this office regardless of how minor the offeror may believe it is. If no changes have occurred since pre-qualification, the offeror must state this in the letter of interest. Offerors are reminded that the letter of interest is due prior to the closure time and date of this solicitation otherwise the offeror will not be evaluated for pre-qualification for this project.

	Prequalification based on successful prior prequalification for the specific projects list above or based on prequalification in FY 2005 is subject to a satisfactory evaluation of Past and Present Performance as described in Factor 3 below.  Offerors need not provide additional Past Performance information.  The Government will determine the extent to which past performance will be evaluated and the internal and/or external sources from which past performance information will be sought, if any.

Prequalification Requirements

The submissions received in response to the Phase II formal solicitation shall be submitted in the formats provided and will be evaluated in accordance with the evaluation procedures contained in the solicitation. Due to time constraints, it is anticipated that the pre-qualified firms will be required to participate in visits to the project sites within 10 to 15 days after the issuance of the design-bid-build RFP. To offset some of the cost of the site visits and other related costs, pre-qualified firms that do not receive the design-bid-build award will be paid $10,000.00 for a fair and reasonable and responsive project proposal they submit in Phase II.

Phase I

MANDATORY PREQUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: Firms being considered for award under this acquisition are limited to United States person bidders. Each company responding to this notice shall contact the DOS Contract Specialist for a copy of the pamphlet "Certifications Relevant To Public Law 99-399, Statement of Qualifications for Purpose of Section 402 of The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986."  (The pamphlet is contained in the FEDBIZOPPS announcement.)  The pamphlet must be completed and included as part of the pre-qualifications package. If a joint venture is formed, the company having 51 percent or greater interest in the JV must be the one completing the pamphlet. This is a pass/fail evaluated area. Offerors must receive a pass rating in this area before proceeding to the next step in the evaluation process. Information on the US persons requirements may be viewed at:
http://www.statebuy.state.gov/grants/authorities.htm#procurement


SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIREMENT


In order to be eligible to perform under this contract, the pre-qualified firm(s), including all entities which comprise a joint venture, must possess or be able to obtain a Department of Defense (DoD) Secret facility security clearance (FCL) with Secret safeguarding capability, issued in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. All entities comprising a joint venture for this effort must be issued an FCL, as well as the joint venture. If a pre-qualified firm does not possess the necessary DoD FCL, the Department of State will sponsor the firm for an FCL at the time they are determined to be pre-qualified. The Department of State will allow 90 calendar days from the notice of pre-qualification for firms to obtain the necessary FCL. Firms will not receive the classified portions of Phase II of the RFP until they have been issued the appropriate FCL and received Defense Security Service (DSS) approval to safeguard classified documents. Sponsorship does not guarantee that the firm will receive the FCL. The Government will not be obligated to extend its solicitation schedule, or to make an award to a sponsored, pre-qualified firm, if that firm has not been issued a FCL.

Security clearances must be in accordance with the National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DoD 5220.22-M. Specifically designated personnel requiring access to classified information or to the Controlled Access Areas (CAA) must also possess a Secret or Interim Secret personnel security clearance issued by DSS. Offerors already possessing the necessary FCL must submit their appropriate Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code with the required pre-qualification documentation. All firms must comply with security requirements detailed in the NISPOM.

<DESC>Concerns having the ability to furnish the supplies described herein are requested to give written notification (including the telephone number for a point of contact), as described below, to the procuring office above within 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis.  The U.S. Geological Survey, Central Region Geologic Hazards Team, Golden, Colorado, has a requirement for upgrade of a 60-channel seismograph to a 192-channel distributed recorder seismograph system. This system must have the ability to interface and rapidly correlate the Vibroseis seismic source signal that is commonly used in the study of earthquake hazards.  This system must also produce an 8000 sample per channel, 192-channel correlated record, ready for analysis in less than 3 seconds after completion of the listening time.  Based on information available at this time and in accordance with 41 U.S.C.253(c)(l) implemented by FAR 6.302-1, the Government considers the supplies specified as a sole source from Geometrics, Inc., 2190 Fortune Drive, San Jose, California, and proposes to negotiate a contract with that firm on that basis. However, should additional sources be identified, they will be considered.

<DESC>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is conducting market research for patent application analysis tools for automating a wide range of common patent analysis tasks enabling users to analyze patent applications and extract meaningful information/intelligence. This market research shall be conducted at NO COST TO THE GOVERNMENT. This announcement is a Request For Information (RFI), not a solicitation announcement for proposals, and accordingly, no contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Strong relationships with industry are a priority of the USPTO, and the USPTO wishes to express its appreciation in advance to all organizations that choose to provide information in accordance with this information request. 
Background
The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is an agency in the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) with its headquarters presently located in Alexandria, Virginia. The mission of the USPTO is the examination and issuance of patents and the examination and registration of trademarks. The USPTO serves the interest of inventors and businesses with respect to their inventions and corporate products, and service identifications. It also advises and assists the bureaus and offices of the Department of Commerce and other agencies of the Government in matters involving intellectual property. 

Currently the USPTO databases house about 7 million patents and over 30 million documents comprising 19 terabytes of storage with 6,000 internal users and 1,500 concurrent public users. There is an ongoing need to examine patent applications, maintain patent quality, and perform patentability analysis.

ALL ANALYSIS TOOL VENDORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS RFI.  USPTO is considering multiple analysis tools to aid examiners.  It is highly desirable that analysis software products be web-based and platform independent.  The following interest list is not inclusive of all analysis capabilities being sought for consideration.

1.  Improve retrieval of relevant documents by employing latent semantic analysis techniques and/or conceptual search technology (i.e. concept-based search capability), taxonomy or equivalent.

2.  Provide data mining software for analyzing trends in data.  Data mining of numeric data, categorical data, mixed data, sequence and documents.

3.  Provide text mining that enables optimization of information processing by transforming text into data that can be analyzed for information extraction or automatic classification of documents. 
-	Improve text mapping, which involves clustering or categorizing
documents based on the major concepts that are contained within.
		-     Create lists of clusters categorizing the documents.


4.  Use advanced semantic, statistical and structural tagging technologies to tag critical information buried within documents.  Also, tag any textual content for re-use.

    claim tree;
-   Provide claim tree versioning to document the original claim tree
    and claim trees for subsequent actions and amendments; and
-   Provide ability to annotate claim trees.

b.  Automatically highlight claims, which may be subject to rejections 
     based on:
       -  35 U.S.C. 112 2nd paragraph (vague and indefinite, or improper 
           claim language, improper Markush Language, improper Jepson 
           claims)
       -  35 U.S.C. 112 1st paragraph (new matter-if linked to searching the 
           instant specification)
-   non-statutory subject matter (e.g. 35 U.S.C. 101 issues) 

c.  Automate Double Patenting/Interference searches - link to USPTO
     search databases and provide a result set of all applications that have 
     similar claim language.
        -  Automatically generate an Inventor/Assignee search with result set. 
        -  Identify the key words used in the claim set and provide examiners
           with  draft Interference searches.

d.  Provide automated claim checks to identify discrepancies that are used 
     to denote grammar, punctuation or awkward language (translation from 
     a foreign document).

e.  Parse claim set to check for multiple dependencies such as claim 4 
     depending from 1 or 2 or 3. 


6.  Perform real-time, iterative searches of patent data including patent citation search and display.  Iteratively search through generations of patent references and view forward and backward patent references at the same time. 


7.  Ability to develop a custom search loaded with trade journals, all the patent references, all the foreign art, and having references viewed and scrolled through as quickly as 0.5 seconds per page.

<DESC>FACIAL RECOGNITION RECOVERY SYSTEM
REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.  
THERE IS NO SOLICITATION DRAWING PACKAGE AVAILABLE.

This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).

The government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain information on facial recognition software and systems for application in personnel recovery.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  

The Air Warfare Battlelab (AWB), Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, is planning to conduct a study that will evaluate commercial options to solve the following problem:  

The United States Air Force is interested in facial recognition technology that can be used in recovery operations of downed personnel. Specifically, a system that can be fixed to a rescue platform and used to verify the identity of downed aircrews prior to committing forces on the ground (i.e. a stand off capability).  System components envisioned for this application are a camera, software, and a laptop computer. The AWB is interested in Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products that could be combined into a system and used as-is or slightly modified to solve this problem.

These are the desired requirements sought by the USAF:

System must be able to obtain a verifiable image at 500 yds while rescue platform (typically a helicopter) is in motion or hovering and process image quickly (i.e. 2 minutes or less) to allow for ground commitment of a rescue team.  To facilitate effective operation on a helicopter, the entire system must be ruggedized to withstand constant vibration and unintentional impacts.  Also, due to the diversity of operating climes, system should be able to function in ambient temperatures of -25 to 150 F. Any routine system calibrations essential to its operation should be performable in the field and it is imperative that size and weight of this system not restrict or limit the flight characteristics of the rescue platform.   

Requirements for system components:

Camera
        A. Digital, high resolution, and equipped with image stabilization. 
        B. Can function in nighttime conditions and mildly unfavorable weather (rain, snow- not fog). 
        C. Can either be mounted to rescue platform or handheld from within the cabin. 
        D. Must have some field maintainability (i.e. operators can perform minor servicing such as cleaning optics or battery changes).
     
Software-must not require major modification to perform the following functions:
        A. Can verify individual identity despite the following conditions:
        1) 20% obstruction of features such as clothing or facial hair.
        2) Face being covered with face paint, dirt or blood.
        3) Weight gain or loss (includes swelling due to injury) i.e. change of 15% in body mass.
        4) Less than optimum angles (parameters to be determined).
        
        B. Must be Windows based (to complement current AF computer systems).

Computer (Presumably a laptop)
        A. Must have enough processing power to minimize verification process time. 

The AWB is seeking the following specific information from industry representatives:

1.	The manufacturer's suggested retail price for equipment and/or leasing price of the commercial product (if applicable).
2.	The name of distributors who could sell to the Government.
3.	The degree to which the product can meet or exceed the above desirable and beneficial attributes of the USAF.

Requested information must be submitted NO LATER THAN 30 March 06 to Major Cathy Blacklock, Air Warfare Battlelab, 360 Gunfighter Ave, Suite 1, Mountain Home AFB, ID 83648 or Email cathy.blacklock@mountainhome.af.mil.  Major Blacklock can be reached at (208) 828-3542.  A formal solicitation MAY NOT BE ISSUED as a result of this RFI.  Information provided may or may not be included in a formal solicitation.  The USAF will not release any information -- marked with a Proprietary legend -- received in response to this RFI to any firms, agencies, or individuals outside the USAF without written permission in accordance with the legend.

<DESC>The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is seeking contractors interested in providing a full range of Information Technology Business Analysis and Management Support Services.  The services to be provided are more fully described in this “sources sought” notice.

This is not a request for competitive proposals.  This notice is issued as part of FDIC’s market research to identify potential sources with relevant experience and capabilities.  FDIC intends to review the responses received to this notice to assist us in developing a list of prospective offerors for a possible future solicitation.  Interested sources will be required to submit information describing their experience and capabilities and other information as stated in this notice.  The FDIC reserves the right, in its sole discretion and judgment, to determine if a solicitation will be made and which sources are included in any future solicitation list.

BACKGROUND – The FDIC is the independent deposit insurance agency created by Congress to maintain stability and public confidence in the nation’s banking system.  The Division of Information Technology (DIT) is the lead information technology organization within the FDIC and has sole responsibility for information technology (IT) service delivery for the entire corporation.  DIT was established to develop and maintain an applied information technology program responsive to corporate business needs and strategies.

SCOPE – There are three primary functions where FDIC may seek contractor services.   1: To obtain IT services to support the Business Analysis Sections in conducting inception and elaboration phase tasks in the management of the FDIC’s Division of Information Technology (DIT) applications portfolio.  
2:  To obtain management support services for the Business Administration Branch in monitoring the activities of the FDIC Information Technology Application Support (ITAS) contractors.  (The FDIC competitively awarded contracts to four firms in 2005 to provide all IT application support related services.)
3:  To provide support for the independent testing program employed by DIT for all new and existing applications.  The standard system development methodology in use at the FDIC is the Rational Unified Process (RUP).  As appropriate, contractors would use the RUP processes, as modified by the FDIC, in providing support to these three functional areas.  In addition, FDIC is interested in sources possessing a Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level 3 rating. 

Delivery Management Branch - Business Analysis (BA) Support  
The mission of BA is to work with DIT clients to conduct business process reviews, develop business cases, develop and document high-level requirements, provide technical alternatives, ensure solutions are compatible with the enterprise architecture, develop cost estimates and project work plans.

The selected contractor would provide the full range of business analysis support for new projects/initiatives and large enhancement development efforts to existing systems required in support of FDIC’s mission.   More specifically these tasks would directly support FDIC’s RUP activities initiated or completed in the inception and elaboration phase and produce applicable deliverables or artifacts as directed by BA.  
Support of the BA Sections includes the following:

•	Conduct inception and elaboration activities and deliver artifacts as defined in the RUP, as modified by the FDIC.
•	Make recommendations for improving business analysis processes and functions conducted in the BA Sections.  Ensure that a well-defined process is established and followed for various types of projects and sizes.
•	Make recommendations for improving the cost estimating processes conducted in the BA Sections.  

The contractor will be required to conform to the RUP, as modified, by the FDIC and other DIT standards.  It is expected that gate reviews will be performed for key activities and major milestones.  It is expected that the contractor will use the Rational tools and StarTeam, the FDIC standard configuration management tool, in supporting the business analysis activities.

Business Administration Branch (BAB) Management Support
The mission of the BAB is to establish and maintain efficient and effective business processes to support the delivery of IT to the Corporation.  It accomplishes its mission utilizing industry best business practices and corporate policies to ensure establishment of comprehensive IT policies, implement program management oversight,  review and optimize internal operating procedures, manage the IT internal control and audit coordination programs, provide financial management services, establish contract sourcing strategies, manage vendor relationships, and carries out administrative management initiatives in accordance with divisional management needs.  

The Contractor would provide the full range of IT services and management expertise, and solution-related products in this functional category to meet the mission needs of DIT.  This section of the tasks would satisfy the full range of IT management-related requirements. With the pace of change in the IT industry, it is impossible to anticipate how IT requirements and individual programs will evolve over the life of the contract. It is intended that a contractor remain current and continue to provide the full range of IT capabilities/solutions and emerging technologies throughout the term of a contract, if awarded. 

Independent Testing Program
The mission of the Independent Testing Section is to provide policy and procedures for applications testing including planning, case and script development, execution, result documentation, client coordination, pilot implementations, test tool management and test result reporting including system qualification testing, system integration testing, user acceptance testing and stress testing.  The section operates the development laboratory including facility maintenance, scheduling, tools administration, providing assistance to developers and clients and providing requirements-based functional testing and testing/analysis for all high-risk applications. 

The Contractor would provide the full range of IT services involving independent testing, including, but not limited to, product evaluation, application accreditation, and compliance to DIT standards.  These services would need to conform to all RUP, as modified by the FDIC, requirements.

SOLICITATION AND CONTRACTING VEHICLE – FDIC may issue a solicitation for the requirement described herein using a Statement of Objectives approach.  The anticipated contract will cover multiple years.  Individual requirements would most likely be issued using task orders.

REQUIREMENTS – Response to this notice is limited to 10 pages. Please address A through C.
(A)	An Executive Summary describing the following:
1.	Your organization’s general experience in working with clients in providing comprehensive, broad based IT Business Analysis and Management Support services requiring knowledge of RUP.

<SUBJECT>B -- BPA FOR TECHNICAL REVIEW OF REAL ESTATE APPRAISALS
<DESC>The Natural Resources Conservation Service in Nebraska is anticipating establishment of blanket purchase agreements for the technical review of appraisals.     These appraisals have been or will be completed on land located throughout the state of Nebraska that may be placed under a conservation easement through the Grassland Reserve Program (GRP), Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP), Wetlands Reserve Enhancement Program (WREP), Emergency Watershed Program floodplain Easements (EWP-FPE) or the Farm and Ranchland Protection Program (FRPP).     The purpose of the technical review of appraisals is to provide an opinion of the acceptability of the appraisals that provide a market value of the whole subject property before acquisition of an easement (before value) and an opinion of market value of the whole subject property remaining after the proposed easement has been placed (after value) as of a current date of value minus any adjustments for excess irrigation water to arrive at the effect on value of the easement.     The technical review must be completed in compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions and Supplemental Standards issued by NRCS.     The original appraisal being reviewed will have been completed in compliance with the same standards. We anticipate the need for 80 to 100 technical reviews by June 1, 2006.

<SUBJECT>D--Incident Management Analaysis and Reporting System (IMARS) for the Department of the Interior (DOI)
<DESC>This is a COURTESY ANNOUNCEMENT to notify vendors of the Department of Interior's intent to issue a task order under the Veteran's Administration GITSS (Global Information Technology Support Service) government wide award contract. Any interested subcontractors should contact the GITSS vendors that have their contact information listed at website:  www.aac.va.gov/gitss. Please be advised that there WILL NOT be a formal Request For Proposal (RFP).  The RFP will be ISSUED only to the GITSS vendors.  There will be a pre-proposal meeting to be announced at a later date.  Responses to the RFP will be due approximately 60 days following issuance of solicitation. The National Park Service (NPS), within the Department of the Interior (DOI), through this procurement, intends to award to ONE OFFEROR a task order for acquiring a public safety law enforcement system for incident information management, collection, analysis, and reporting. The Incident Management Analysis and Reporting System (IMARS) is being created to provide a Department-wide incident information collection, analysis, and reporting system for incident information from three inter-related activities.  These activities are law enforcement, emergency management, and security. IMARS will be an automated system that is scalable and will allow law enforcement (including emergency management and security) areas within DOI to identify, collect, store, retrieve, analyze, manage and report information related to incidents in both a connected and disconnected mode.  IMARS will allow DOI and bureau users to create reports in various formats, sort data, conduct data analysis and interface with other systems, both within and external to DOI. NPS is the lead bureau on this project.  The other participating bureaus are the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  (including the National Wildlife Refuge System), the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Bureau of Land Management.  Some portions of the Office of the Secretary, primarily the Office of Law Enforcement and Security and the Departmental Watch Office, will also be participating. The IMARS project is seeking an integrated IT solution that leverages current "best of breed" technologies.  The solution will be based on a proven integration framework of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) and/or modified-off-the-shelf (MOTS) software, and open standards, leading to seamless product integration and information sharing.  The solution will provide functional modularity, such that additional application features can be phased-in as needed (i.e., extensibility, scalability, reliability, performance, etc.), and operate in a large government multi-bureau environment. The system will be capable of handling a minimum of 2,000,000 incidents per year across all of the participating Bureaus of DOI and will be capable of handling a total of no less than 10,000 system users (approximately 2,000 concurrent). IMARS will use COTS/MOTS software.  New software will not be developed "from scratch" for IMARS.  A COTS/MOTS solution may be integrated with other COTS/MOTS products to meet specific IMARS requirements. The system will be in a stable state of operation across all of the Bureaus and DOI beginning Fiscal Year 2009 (i.e., October 1, 2008). End of Notice.

<SUBJECT>D -- NCES Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Foundation and Content Discovery and Delivery (CD&D) Services
<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), Net-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES) Program Management Office (PMO), in coordination with DISA’s Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO), is developing a strategy for acquiring the NCES Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) Foundation and Content Discovery and Delivery (CD&D) services. These NCES services facilitate the ability of the DoD to deploy interoperable service-based applications.  Using multiple RFPs, the goal is to acquire the capabilities of these services to support the net-centric transformation of DoD warfighting, business and intelligence capabilities. 

These capabilities will be acquired as loosely coupled services, and acquired as commercially managed services where feasible.  When managed services is the alternative selected, options include hosting in a commercial service provider’s or a Defense facility.  In either case, the services provided will be governed by service level agreements (SLAs) between DISA and the service providers.  The SOA Foundation and CD&D provide DoD with a core set of services that enable construction of Web-based business processes, e.g. Security, Mediation, capability to discover services, etc.

The government intends to conduct these acquisitions under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15.  Contractors will be required to support a minimum of SECRET security clearance and proposed managed services will be required to achieve “Authority to Operate” (ATO) in accordance with DODI 8500.2.  DISA will be conducting Market Research as part of the acquisition planning phase.  It is anticipated that an on-line Market Research Questionnaire will be posted to the DITCO Contracting Opportunity Home Page for industry participation on February 27, 2006.  Responses to the Questionnaire will be due by March 17, 2006.

Details regarding this acquisition will also be available during NCES Industry Day to be held from 8:00 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. on March 10, 2006 at 5275 Leesburg Pike Falls Church, VA, 22041.  Interested service providers and consultants are encouraged to attend.  If you are interested in attending the NCES Industry Day, please register by accessing the on-line registration for the NCES SOA and CD&D Industry Day on the DITCO Contracting Opportunity Home Page. 

All future messages and documents regarding this acquisition, including the Market Research Questionnaire and final RFP, will be found at DITCO’s Contracting Opportunities Home Page at  https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Integrated Emissivity and Temperature Measurement of a Surface
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
Integrated Emissivity and Temperature Measurement 
of a Surface

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license and commercially develop its Systems and Methods for Integrated Emissivity and Temperature Measurement of a Surface.

Background:  It is relatively easy to measure the radiation spectrum from a target surface. However, the spectrum itself does not yield information about the temperature without knowledge or information about the emissivity of the surfaces as a function of wavelength and possibly angle. The emissivity is often assumed to be constant or have a prescribed variation with wavelength. In actuality, the emissivity can vary strongly and without regularity as a function of wavelength. A lack of knowledge of the emissivity leads to a large uncertainty in the temperature obtained from the radiation measurement. 

Description:  LLNL’s  invention relates to pyrometry and more particularly to systems and methods for implementing pyrometric measurements of simple or complex surfaces of interest. A multi-channel spectrometer together with a light source is used to measure both the emitted and the reflected light from a surface.  Systems and methods of this invention add a measurement of reflected and/or incident light to the information used to determine surface emissivity and temperature. 

Advantages:  One feature of this invention is that it uses relative values between channels versus absolute values of the measurement. The use of relative values cancels out geometry factors and eliminates the need for absolute calibrations. Another feature is that it is fast enough to be applied to rapidly moving or changing surfaces. A further feature is that the fiberoptics for the sensors and fiberoptics for the incoming light are located very near the same point in space to automatically correct for the angle of dependence of the emissivity. 

Potential Applications:  

This device can be used for radiation thermometry, emissivity and temperature measurement. The device can be used to measure the temperature of a surface that has been shocked or deformed. The measurement can be used to provide information on the pressure—volume relationship for materials under high pressure conditions. Remote and non-contact measurement of temperature is important in many commercial applications involving materials processing or control, such as melting, wafer manufacturing or glass manufacturing.





Development Status:  

This invention is covered under U. S. Patent No. 6,963,816, issued 11/8/05. LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.  

Please visit the IPAC website at http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/workwithus/partneringprocess.php
for more information on working with LLNL and the industrial partnering and technology transfer process.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Systems and Methods for Integrated Emissivity and Temperature Measurement of a Surface. should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY GuardDog Intrusion Detection Sensors
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
GuardDog Intrusion Detection Sensors
Opportunity: 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to one or more industrial partners to help further develop and commercialize LLNL’s GuardDog Intrusion Detection Sensors. The GuardDog technology is a great opportunity for research, development, and rapid commercialization.

Background: 
GuardDog http://www.llnl.gov/IPandC/technology/profile/announcement/GuardDog_Intrusion_Detection_Sensors.php is a revolutionary network of sensors that can constantly monitor an area for intrusion detection and relay the sensed data to a satellite or another receiver many kilometers away. The basic GuardDog sensors are used to detect motion or serve in “wake-up” scenarios where they trigger another device such as a camera or radiation detector. More sophisticated GuardDog sensors can be used to distinguish human activity from motions generated by wildlife, wind, etc., and the sensors can track and record the exact locations of the activity. Most importantly, the sensors ultra-wideband (UWB) signals for high performance in harsh propagation environments where even the most advanced commercially available sensors face difficulty. These include heavily “cluttered” environments found in dense urban areas, indoors with metallic and concrete obstacles such as warehouses, and inside cargo containers. GuardDog sensors are resistant to jamming, detection, and tampering. The basic sensors, which measure roughly 8 inches long by 3 inches in diameter, can be easily camouflaged or hidden in artificial rocks and in and behind walls. The sensors can be scattered in an ad-hoc manner, be placed surreptitious to build an electronic “fence”, e.g. around a building, or used strategically, e.g. in a stairwell or alleyway to protect assets. 

Description: 
GuardDog technology uses ultra-wideband (UWB) impulse sensors (also known as micropower impulse radar or MIR), optional global positioning systems (GPS), local signal processing, and user-selectable (power and bandwidth) radio frequency (RF) communication transceivers. UWB sensors emit and detect very-low-amplitude and short-voltage impulses for detecting returning radar signals. By employing a precise “range-gate,” UWB signals are used to create an omni-directional detecting shell of user-selected diameter. A network of these sensors can form a protective ad-hoc area-wide coverage, be placed strategically, or form a “fence” around selected facilities, in which all motion inside or outside the area of interest is ignored. 

Potential Applications: 

GuardDog sensor networks can be used to reliably monitor a wide range of environments for civilian applications including habitat monitoring, environment observation, health monitoring, home automation, and smart home/office environments. Furthermore, motion detection for strategically important areas could be extremely useful for infrastructure protection and warfare applications such as sniper protection in tactical battlefields, silent monitoring of insurgent activities, and border control. 

Advantages:  

Feature	Benefit
UWB Signaling	Resistance to jamming and tampering, covertness, high performance in cluttered and urban environments
Low transmit power (3 mW)	Very long battery life
Omni-directional Antenna	360 degree field of view prevents tampering
Networkability	The sensed data can be transferred to a destination many kilometers away
Does not require Line of Sight (LOS) for detection
	Detection can be achieved from multiple directions

Development Status: 

A family of prototypes have been built including sensors with radar ranges up to 40 feet. Prototypes include advanced low-power message hopping protocol, automatic background noise calibration, GPS, and health status checks.

This technology had been successfully fielded and tested for DOD in a variety of exercises, including a 5 star node configuration outdoors with satellite exfiltration and simultaneous internet broadcast. Prototypes also tested 24/7 over several months for DOE in a 12-node network (indoors) with low false alarms. System is ready for larger deployment. 

LLNL is seeking industry partners with a demonstrated ability to bring such inventions to the market. Moving critical technology beyond the Laboratory to the commercial world helps our licensees gain a competitive edge in the marketplace. All licensing activities are conducted under policies relating to the strict nondisclosure of company proprietary information.

<DESC>(i) THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  (ii) Solicitation No. BBGCON3406S5855 is issued as a Request For Proposal (RFP) and a single contract will be awarded using the contracting by negotiation procedures.  (iii) This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-07, dated February 2, 2006.  (iv) This requirement is 100% set-aside for small businesses only under NAICS 512110, Motion Picture and Video Production (TV show production).  (v) The International Broadcasting Bureau’s (IBB), Central News Division of Voice of America (VOA), has a requirement to establish an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract for a single Contractor to provide Packaged Television News/Feature Reports (hereinafter referred to as “TV Reports”) to the VOA.   The Contractor shall provide a minimum of 10 TV reports (but not more than 60 TV reports) per calendar month to the VOA.   The objective is to meet VOA’s ever-growing need for a steady reliable supply of television reports suitable for worldwide broadcasting, as described in the Statement of Work herein. This requirement is a new venture for VOA.  There is no incumbent Contractor.  All anticipated costs incurred by the Contractor to produce and submit finished packaged TV reports to the VOA shall be included in the firm-fixed price submitted in their price proposal.  Offeror shall provide a firm-fixed price (FFP) for each Agency-approved broadcast quality program using the following Contract Line Item Numbers (CLIN) format below. CLIN B.1: Packaged TV News/Feature Reports (Base Year):B.1.1   1:30 up to 2:30 minutes each $_____ B.1.2   2:30 up to 4:00 minutes each $_____ CLIN B.2--Option Year 1: B.2.1   1:30 up to 2:30 minutes each $_____ B.2.2   2:30 up to 4:00 minutes each $_____ CLIN B.3—Option Year 2:B.3.1   1:30 up to 2:30 minutes each $_____ B.3.2   2:30 up to 4:00 minutes each $_____ CLIN B.4-- Option Year 3: B.4.1   1:30 up to 2:30 minutes each $_____  B.4.2   2:30 up to 4:00 minutes each $_____  CLIN B.5--Option Year 4: B.5.1   1:30 up to 2:30 minutes each $_____  B.5.2   2:30 up to 4:00 minutes each $_____   Option Year prices may include escalation.  The Contractor shall submit an invoice to the VOA on a monthly basis for each accepted report.  (vi) STATEMENT OF WORK:  REQUIREMENT:  Each TV report shall be from a minimum of 1:30 minutes to a maximum of 4 minutes in length and shall include: (1) a finished TV report voiced in English without standup; to include a tag out: “This is Joe Reporter FOR VOA News.”  However, if there are special security concerns, the reporter does not have to sign out. (2) a natural-sound re-feed of said TV report of all relevant video and additional b-roll of an extra minute; (3) audio for each TV report; (4) a script, (5) a countdown and (6) a shot sheet for each TV report.  Any sound involving a foreign language shall be accompanied by an English-language translation as part of the text information.  Animation/graphics is acceptable when appropriate, but the finished product will be versioned into dozens of different languages, therefore English text should not be used in TV graphics or animation.  The animation/graphics will need to visually say what is needed without text. Work shall be performed in the Contractor’s facilities.   TV packages shall not be chyroned.  VOA does not require a preferred type of editing software to be used.  The Contractor is responsible for all travel and transmission costs incurred to produce and submit a finished Packaged TV Report.  Stories are commissioned by mutual agreement between both Parties, therefore Contractor must take into consideration travel costs before they agree to produce a story.  TOPICS: VOA will issue assignments to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall submit story proposals to VOA. Subject matter shall generally cover issues that are timely and of news value, but NOT the headline news of the day.  Because of the nature of the Agency’s internal video distribution and production, VOA requires a TV report to have at least three days of “shelf life” once it is delivered, but VOA anticipates many of the reports to be features and to have a much longer shelf life. Topics shall include (but not limited to) science, health, medicine, technology, business entertainment and lifestyle stories of interest to international audiences.  Venues for stories can either be the U.S. or abroad, although U.S. domestic stories will constitute the majority of those provided.  The Contractor shall provide a mix of overseas and domestic stories.  Approximately 40% of the stories will be shot internationally.  WORK FLOW:  The Executive Producer to VOA’s Central News Division will be designated Authorized Representative of the Contracting Officer (ARCO) and will collaborate with the Contractor to choose stories to be covered and set deadlines, with the Contractor designating a staff member to serve as point of contact.  The Contractor will pitch story ideas to the ARCO either by email or by telephone.  Taking into consideration of topic complexity and content, the ARCO will make a mutual determination with the Contractor on the length of the report.  VOA’s approval and go-ahead time line would be based on the story, generally within hours, but no more than a day.  The Contractor is responsible for writing the scripts for each story.  The time line for script approval depends upon the story.  If it is a feature, VOA will get back to the Contractor within 24 hours.  If the story is urgent, VOA can get back to the Contractor within an hour or two.  Contractor shall then arrange for coverage of the story by any means deemed feasible by the Contractor, so long as the product meets VOA’s professional and journalistic standards.  The time frame for each finished TV report will be mutually agreed upon when the story is ordered.  For some stories, there could be a great deal of lead-time granted to the Contractor after the story has been ordered.  For other stories that are more news driven, VOA may require a much quicker turnaround.  Generally, one to two weeks would be the average execution time from conception to completion.  However, that can vary greatly depending on the subject and whether the IBB is responding to a news event.  Some execution times could be as short as two or three days when VOA is responding to a crisis, while others could be a month or two.  Once VOA approves the story idea, VOA is obligated to pay for the package even if it is not used, unless 1) the story is cancelled by mutual consent, 2) the deadline for delivery is not met, or 3) the content of the story is not what was promised.  There will be no cancellation fees.  Unless mutually agreed upon prior to production, the Contractor will not have access to VOA’s tape library and/or video feeds for use in the production of the packages.  VOA will fill limited video gaps with file or news feed video.  The majority of the story should always be original footage, however, Contractor’s use of his own file or tape library footage is acceptable, when appropriate.  VOA will review each script prior to final production.  Upon script approval from VOA, Contractor shall supply a finished TV report voiced in English, a natural sound version of said TV report and complete sound bites at full audio level, and additional b-roll for lengthening said TV report.  Contractor shall produce the final version and transmit the entire product (package, b-roll, supporting text) to VOA via a method agreed to by both parties.  The required format for audio and video can be either NTSC Beta SP, Beta SX, DV, DVCAM, or as a broadcast quality video feed or digital video file, as long as VOA is able to download the file and turn it into a broadcast quality video product.   NTSC is the preferred format for delivery of international stories to the VOA.  VOA will reformat the story to appropriate standard in transmission.  For the submitted packages, track one shall be mixed, track two shall contain natural sound and sound bites up full and complete.  The method of transmission could include Internet, satellite, conventional shipping or clip mail method.   Be advised that VOA routinely receives MPEG 2 files from their field offices.  All TV material shall be broadcast quality.  CONDITIONS: VOA: (a) VOA is not required to use any material provided by the Contractor; (b) Can mix Contractor’s material with other audio or video as needed; (c) VOA retains unlimited retransmission rights from date of delivery; (d) VOA retains unlimited rights over all material submitted by Contractor under terms of the contract;  (e) VOA does not retain exclusive rights for the material; (f) VOA has full authority to translate scripts and sound into any of its broadcasts languages without prior approval or oversight by the Contractor; (g) VOA can use TV report audio for radio reports and can make material provided under terms of the contract available on VOA Internet sites, including video streaming; (h)  The TV packages will not be used by other IBB entities such as TV & Radio Marti, or Al Hurra, without Contractor’s consent but VOA will have the right to offer the TV packages to affiliates outside of VOA/IBB; (i) VOA can provide training for Contractor’s personnel, if necessary, on minor aspects of script or video delivery.

STATEMENT OF WORK

A.1  	Introduction:	
The United States Department Of Commerce (USDOC)/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) requires teardown, inspection, repair (as needed) and test cell run services  for a Rolls-Royce T56-A-14 Engine Assembly, S/N 0TH5866.

A.2   Background:	
The NOAA/AOC operates two (2) Lockheed WP-3D aircraft designated for atmospheric research.  Each aircraft uses four (4) Rolls-Royce T56-A-14 engines.  The engine in the #2 position (S/N 0TH5866) on aircraft N42RF was removed due to a recurring intermittent chips light.  The chips light was illuminating 2 to 3 hours into the flight and remaining on for periods of 10 seconds to 5 hours intermittently. Subsequent inspection of the Reduction Gearbox and engine magnetic plugs revealed slivers and flaking on the Reduction Gearbox plug (all within maintenance instruction manual limits). Penalty runs were conducted after each of the four occurrences with negative results and the aircraft was returned to service each time. Illumination of the chips light occurred over a period of six (6) non-consecutive flights totaling approximately fifty-five (55) flight hours. The engine has a Time Since Repair (TSR) of 1781.4 hours and a Time Since New (TSN) of 19,063.4 hours. 

A.3   Scope:	
The Contractor shall provide all materials, equipment, special tools, services, certified factory trained personnel (labor), parts and facilities to perform the services/work identified herein.   The inspection, teardown and repair work shall be in accordance with the manufacturer’s maintenance manual and applicable repair station procedures.

•	Contractor shall accept the engine in the Quick Engine Change (QEC), mounted on an AOC owned engine stand.  Upon receipt of the engine, the Contractor shall provide teardown and inspection services on the engine (S/N OTH5866) and prepare a “worst case scenario” proposal to repair the engine. The proposal must include Reduction Gearbox (RGB), Compressor, and Turbine teardown and inspection items.  

•	Within ten (10) working days after receipt of the above engine, the Contractor will provide the Contracting Officer Representative (COR) with a teardown/inspection report identifying parts and labor, including costs to complete any outstanding Airworthiness Directives (AD) or Service Bulletins (SB), required to return the assembly to a serviceable, ready for installation condition. The report shall include a detailed tear down report, projected repair time and a cost estimate for the repair of each module.  The Contractor shall make recommendations identifying the most cost effective and advantageous means to accomplish such work. 

•	The Contractor’s teardown and recommendations report will be reviewed by the Contracting Officer (CO) and the COR.  Upon completion of the review, the CO shall provide written authorization to proceed with the accepted recommendations.  

•	If any additional repair items outside the normal repair criteria are discovered during performance of the work, the Contractor shall immediately stop work, if necessary, and notify the COR of the  discrepancy(s).  Such notification must include:



		• Description of each discrepancy found
		• Number of man-hours per discipline required to complete each 			              discrepancy
		• Hourly rate for personnel performing the work
		• Parts costs (Show list price minus appropriate discount 				               percentage)
		• Total Dollar Amount for each discrepancy
		• Total Dollar Amount for complete list of discrepancies
The Contractor’s proposal for over and above discrepancies shall be based on the loaded hourly labor rate and discounted parts pricing agreed upon in the Contract.  The COR will be responsible for reviewing the list of discrepancies and making a recommendation to either accept or decline the Contractor’s proposal.  In the event additional work is recommended to the CO by the COR, a formal approval document will be prepared by the CO and presented to the Contractor.  Therefore, no additional work shall be performed on the engine without prior approval from the CO.  
•	The Contractor shall comply with any outstanding service bulletins and airworthiness directives that must be complied with, and provide the AOC with any recommendations for maintenance that would prevent future failures if applicable. 

•	During reassembly of the modules into the QEC, the Contractor shall remove all of the RGB and engine mount assemblies and replace them with new or newly overhauled mount assemblies. 

•	The Contractor shall complete and record a post-maintenance test cell run. Test cell run results will be evaluated by the COR before acceptance of the engine for return to service. The engine shall have an efficiency of no less than 100% with all other parameters being within the manufacturer’s limits before returning the engine to service. 

•	The Contractor shall be responsible for all, FAA (i.e., FAA 8130 or equivalent and FAA 337, if required) and AOC required documentation to include, but not limited to, the approval for return to service. Upon return to service of the assembly, the contractor shall make the required entries into the engine log book provided with the engine. 

•	The engine shall be returned to the AOC on the same transportation stand provided at delivery.

A.5	Parts, Discounts, Labor Rates and Warranties:	
Parts:  The Contractor shall provide all replacement parts, materials, and consumables. However, the Government reserves the right to provide the same, if advantageous, at any time during the contract.  The Government will make the final determination on whether new, overhauled, or serviceable parts will be installed in the assemblies.  Parts or components in an “as removed” condition will not be installed in the assemblies.  Any part or component that has not reached its recommended service life, but fails inspection and needs to be replaced, will be treated as an “over-and-above.”  Since the government cannot determine which parts or components, if any, may require replacement, the Contractor must provide labor rates and parts pricing information as described below. 

Parts Discount:  Contractors must provide the discount percent to be applied to the list price for replacement parts for “over and above” items. 

Labor Rates:  The Contractor must provide the loaded hourly labor rate (regular rate and overtime rate) to be charged to the Government for “over and above” discrepancies.

Warranty:  The Contractor shall provide the AOC with a minimum warranty of one hundred hours flight time or six (6) months from the time of installation of the engine.


A.6	   Period of Performance:
Due to mission requirements and the limited number of spares possessed by the AOC, the Contractor must provide a turn-around time not to exceed ninety (90) working days from the date the engine is delivered to the Contractor’s facility.  Should abnormal requirements and/or circumstances occur, which would require an extension of this performance period, the Contractor must immediately provide documentation to the CO as to the reason and extent of the abnormal requirements and/or circumstances including the estimated time required for such extension.

A.7   Insurance against Loss or Damage to Government Property:  
The Contractor shall, at its own expense, provide and maintain liability insurance of not less than $750,000.00 to cover the engine on which this work will be performed.  Before award of this contract, the offerors shall provide to the CO written documentation that the required insurance has been obtained.  The policies evidencing the required insurance shall contain an endorsement to the effect that any cancellation or any material change adversely affecting the Government’s interest shall not be effective:

1.	For such a period as the laws of the State in which this work is to be performed prescribe and;
2.	Until 30 days after the insurer or the Contractor gives written notice to the Contracting Officer, whichever period is longer.

A.8   Transportation Expenses:  
The cost of shipping the engine to and from the Contractor’s facility shall be the responsibility of the Government.

A.9   Submittal of Invoices:  
Contractor shall submit invoices to:  USDOC/NOAA/AOC, 7917 Hangar Loop Drive, Hangar 5, MacDill AFB, Florida 33621, Attention:  Greg Bast, COR.  All invoices will be reviewed by the COR to determine if the Government is receiving the best value for the services that were provided.

B.1   Evaluation Criteria: 
The evaluation of proposals shall be based on the Offeror’s responsiveness to the items listed in Section A.4, Offeror’s price proposal and the Offeror’s ability to exhibit an understanding of the requirements included in this RFP.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide clarifications based on questions from industry regarding the technical specifications.  Therefore, the solicitation is amended as follows:

1.  Question: The solicitation states that "The system shall include at least one analog input channel for auxiliary signals."  If a system does not include a specific analog input channel for auxiliary signals, but does have other auxiliary signals, such as pressure, that could be used as analog inputs, will this satisfy the stated requirement?

Answer: The minimum requirements include at least one analog input channel.  Modifications or suggested optional uses of system components will be considered, however, they must still allow the device to meet all minimum requirements.

2.  Question: The solicitation states that "strongest consideration shall be given to ... a device which simulates respiratory events such as coughing and sneezing."  Is it acceptable that the cough or sneeze occur during each repeat of the waveform?

Answer: A repeated coughing or sneezing event during continuous breathing is acceptable.

3.  The response date for this solicitation remains unchanged.
