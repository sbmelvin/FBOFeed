<DESC>On behalf of the Army National Guard (ARNG), the Army Contracting Command - Orlando (ACC-ORL) is issuing this synopsis IAW the requirement at FAR Subpart 5.2 Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions.
<p>The Government intends to award a contract for the eXportable Combat Training Capability (XCTC) program.  The U.S. Government's determination is the anticipated XCTC contract shall be competed under Full and Open Competition.</p>
<p>The XCTC is the ARNG capstone training event for Brigade Combat Teams (BCT) to attain T-Level 3 (T3) training readiness. Accordingly, the XCTC program affords commanders the opportunity to assess Mission Essential Task (MET) proficiency in force-on-force and live fire training environments. The XCTC mission is twofold: first, develop adaptive leaders; and secondly, enable platoons to achieve trained proficiency in core functions or designed capabilities.</p>
<p>The intent of the DRAFT solicitation is to allow an exchange with industry in the form of questions, comments, and recommendations regarding the XCTC requirements. Potential Offerors should not rely upon the DRAFT solicitation in developing their final proposed approach.  The final RFP is likely to differ from the draft.  Potential Offerors are encouraged to comment on all aspects of the DRAFT solicitation and identify unnecessary or inefficient requirements for the XCTC effort that may significantly improve the final solicitation.</p>
<p>All questions, comments, and recommendations shall be submitted via email to the Contract Specialist, Graham Oliff at graham.k.oliff.civ@mail.mil no later than 2:00 pm Eastern Standard Time on 4 March 2019 with the full DRAFT solicitation number within the subject line.&nbsp;Questions, comments, and recommendations submitted prior to this date/time will be accepted and are highly encouraged.  Questions, comments, and recommendations submitted via phone will NOT be accepted.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government. Not responding to this announcement does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued</p>
