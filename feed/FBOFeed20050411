B. Full text of announcement

The DARPA Information Processing Technology Office (IPTO) is soliciting proposals to perform research, design, development and integration to support the Adaptive Cognition Enhanced Radio Teams (ACERT) Program. The ACERT Program will develop fundamental techniques and technologies for software-defined radios. The ACERT Program will also have an integrator tasked with fostering open source development support for ACERT-developed code. DARPA plans to hold a Proposer Day for ACERT, the details of which will be posted as a revision to this BAA. Technical proposals should address all of the forthcoming ACERT challenges and result in a working prototype system. Performers are encouraged to use open source Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) licensing to enhance technology transition, although other development models and licenses will be considered. In addition to this BAA and before submitting proposals, a prospective offeror MUST refer to the ACERT Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP) located at the DARPA website, http://www.darpa.mil/ipto/solicitations/solicitations.htm. The ACERT PIP contains additional details on the program objectives, application space, program description, evaluation plans and metrics, program scope, general information, submission process, reporting requirements and procedures, proposal format, evaluation and funding processes and administrative addresses. As with any DoD research, if the research yields results with a military application, the potential for classification exists.  

I.  Funding Opportunity Description 
PROGRAM SCOPE DARPA
1.1	ACERT
The goal of the ACERT program is to construct a distributed radio team that is able to use capabilities inherent in aggregating nodes, while leveraging advantages that are unique to a distributed system.  

1.1.1	ACERT CHALLENGES  
The ACERT program has three primary challenges:
a.	Creating models, algorithms, and prototypes for distributed control of radio resources and shared situation awareness.
b.	Designing and implementing team access controls including new models for decentralized trust and new algorithms that take advantage of locality and density.
c.	Managing collaborative channel characteristics including leveraging of the broadcast channel for shared awareness, cross-layer optimizations, and possibilities for cognitive Media Access Control (MAC) layers that improve their performance over time.

1.1.2	ACERT PROGRAMMATICS AND SCHEDULING 
Proposals should be for a base period of 18 months (Phase I). Proposers are encouraged to provide for optional tasks in Phase II (18 months). The decision point at the end of Phase I will include an evaluation of progress toward satisfying the ACERT GOAL Metrics. Funding for Phase II will be subject to satisfactory progress of ACERT research and DARPA priorities.

1.1.3	ACERT GOAL METRICS (see ACERT PIP for details)

1.1.4	ACERT INTEGRATION 
The ACERT integration task will be to create interest in a development community to perpetuate open source development of ACERT, and host and maintain the products of the ACERT technical performers. Additionally, the systems integrator will also be required to focus on cross-platform portability, validation, maintenance, documentation and version control of the software. Organizations may propose to perform both development and integration for ACERT. 

1.2	INDEPENDENT TEST AND EVALUATION (ITE)
The independent test and evaluator will be responsible for assessing progress toward the goal metrics for each phase of the ACERT program. This is not a solicitation for proposals to perform independent test and evaluation tasks. 

II. Award Information 
The Government reserves the right to select all, some portion, or none of the proposals received in response to this solicitation and to make awards without discussions with offerors. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if the Source Selection Authority later determines them to be necessary.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors.  If warranted, portions of resulting awards may be segregated into pre-priced options.

III. Eligibility Information
1.  Eligible Applicants

All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal that shall be considered by DARPA.  Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for Small Disadvantaged Business, HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of this research for exclusive competition among these entities. Awards made under this BAA may be subject to the provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 9.5, Organizational Conflict of Interest. All offerors and proposed subcontractors must affirmatively state whether they are supporting any DARPA technical office(s) through an active contract or subcontract. All affirmations must state which office(s) the offeror supports, and identify the prime contract number.  Affirmations should be furnished at the time of proposal submission.  All facts relevant to the existence or potential existence of organizational conflicts of interest, as that term is defined in FAR 2.101, must be disclosed in Volume I of the proposal, organized by task and by year.  This disclosure shall include a description of the action the Contractor has taken, or proposes to take, to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate such conflict.  
2.  Cost Sharing or Matching
Cost sharing is not required for this particular program. However, cost sharing will be carefully considered where there is an applicable statutory condition relating to the selected funding instrument (e.g., for any Technology Investment Agreement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371). 

IV. Application and Submission Information

1.  Address to Request Application Package

This announcement contains or refers to all information required to submit a proposal.  

2.  Content and Form of Application Submission
a.  This BAA requires completion of an online Cover Sheet for each Proposal prior to submission.  To do so, the offeror must go to http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=05-37  and follow the instructions there.  Each offeror is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and attaching it to every copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the first page of the Proposal.  If an offeror intends to submit more than one Proposal, a unique UserId and password must be used in creating each Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being evaluated.
b.  Security classification guidance on a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since DARPA is soliciting ideas only.  After reviewing incoming proposals, if a determination is made that contract award may result in access to classified information, a DD Form 254 will be issued upon contract award.  If you choose to submit a classified proposal you must first receive the permission of the Original Classification Authority to use their information in replying to this BAA.  
c.  New Requirements/Procedures.  
The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IPTO Quarterly Status Reports and an Annual Project Summary Report. All unclassified reports will be submitted electronically via the DARPA/IPTO Technical-Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government-furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the PIP.
d.  Proposal Format.   Proposers must submit an original and four copies of the full proposal and two electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on a 3.5-inch floppy disk or CD-R).  Mac-formatted disks will not be accepted.  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 05-37, proposer organization, proposal title (short title recommended) and Copy number of 4.  
3.  Submission Dates and Times
The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted in time to reach DARPA by 12:00 NOON (ET) May 26, 2005 in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 05-37, the ACERT BAA will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) April 11, 2006. Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through April 11, 2006. While the proposals submitted after the May 26, 2005 deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals.

4.  Intergovernmental Review – N/A
5.  Funding Restrictions
Authorization of precontract costs will be considered in situations of genuine urgency where programmatic benefits will accrue from their use.
6.  Other Submission Requirements
Proposals not meeting the format described in the ACERT PIP may not be reviewed.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 05-37 PIP and all references, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued.  Requests for same will be disregarded.

When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.

<CONTACT>Cathy Reuther, Contracting Officer, Phone 801-775-2377, Email Cathy.Reuther@hill.af.mil
<DESC>Solicitation issue date: 26 APR 2005. JOVIAL is a legacy programming language developed by and for the Air Force for use in embedded flight systems, most notably the MIL-STD-1750A processor.  The majority of fielded flight systems continue to use programs written and maintained in JOVIAL and the JOVIAL Program Office (JPO) provides a written standardized complement of development tools known as the Integration Tool Set (ITS).
Over the past 20 years, the JPO has worked closely with Software Engineering Associates, Inc. (SEA) to augment the ITS in support of expanding the reusability and applicability for legacy systems within the Air Force and other DoD agencies.  These tools permit Air Force organizations to comply with DoD policy to reuse legacy flight systems to reduce cost and avoid new development efforts.
Central to this effort has been the ability of the JPO to acquire unrestricted distribution rights to many of SEA’s corporate (COTS) JOVIAL compilers hosted and targeted to various legacy processors and new COTS processors being used as replacements on various sustainment projects.  
There are no other contractors that have the capability to maintain SEA software.  Consequently it is necessary for the JPO to retain the services of SEA for continued sustainment and improvement of the ITS. 
The current contractor Software Engineering Support is the only contractor with 
developed, maintainable JOVIAL compliers.  Any other contractor will need to purchase source rights from SEA to maintain existing Air Force compilers.  Any other contractor could develop their own compilers at approximately $1MIL but would still need to purchase source rights.  SEA has estimated the cost of purchasing these rights to be $7MIL.   In talking with all interested sources that responded to the RFI FA8201-05-AAAV they could develop new compliers and purchase the source rights however they would expect to be reimbursed for the costs of these services.  However, the Government would incur substantial duplication of cost if the Government contracts with another contractor to develop the compliers or purchase the source rights.  
Under current market conditions there is no other source known for common applications for this effort except SEA.

<DESC>The Air Force Material Command (AFMC) is seeking interested sources for the Production Phase of the Gas Sampler Program (GSP).  The focus of the production phase is to manufacture GSP machines that comply with a Government-provided technical data package.   Engineering enhancements to the production baseline  may be required.     The GSP is a sophisticated, ground-based, atmospheric sampling system used for nuclear treaty monitoring.  The system continuously and autonomously samples whole air and employs advanced methods to separate radioactive xenon from whole air constituents.  Gas chromatography is used to further purify the collected samples.  The purified samples are automatically transferred to an onboard nuclear detector to measure the radioactivity of the sample as well as the volume of the gas sample being counted.  Once measured, the sample is archived and the results of the measurement are reported by the GSP to a remote facility.  Each machine has onboard radioactive calibration sources that are used to periodically check for potential drift and mis-alignment of the nuclear  detector's components.   The system employs a QNX operating system with  specialized application software for system control, status of health monitoring, alert generation and remote command and control.  Each GSP system includes a maintenance computer with specialized software, and a hand-held PDA with special code.  The Government's technical data package (TDP) is fairly extensive but further enhancements to the system as well as potential parts or software obsolescence issues necessitate that prospective sources have expertise in QNX application development, embedded software development, chemical engineering processes to include gas chromatography, and nuclear  particle physics.   In addition, qualified sources will have proven production  management expertise, experience with fabrication of small diameter tubing, advanced welding techniques, electronic design/manufacturing, developing or modifying Mil-Std drawings, SW lifecycle management, SW simulator design, and  manufacture of chemical processing equipment.    Current System Parameters include the following: 1.  Hardware:   --  Pentium-based, rack-mounted computer --  Beta-Gamma Coincidence Detector --  Chromatographic Separation Columns  2.	Software:  QNX 3.	Code:  C, Visual Basic Contractor responsibility will include the manufacture, test, and configuration control of GSP machines.  In addition, the contractor will design, integrate and upgrade fielded equipment with advanced features.  The Contractor will develop and conduct depot-level maintenance training for both HW and SW.  All personnel should have a Secret clearance.  The work will be accomplished at the contractor's facility.   A technical library is available at Patrick Air Force Base where the following documents can be reviewed.  Appointments can be scheduled through the POC listed in this announcement. The Government's current TDP includes: System/Subsystem Specification - FINAL	Computer Software -DRAFT System/Subsystem Design Document - FINAL	Initial Spares List -DRAFT Product Drawings + Associated Lists -DRAFT	Support Equipment List -DRAFT Test Procedures -DRAFT		USAF Technical Manuals -DRAFT Software Requirements Specification -FINAL	Software Design Description - DRAFT An additional technical information sheet can be provided to potential offerors providing a DoD Secret clearance.   Information in this sources sought synopsis is for planning purposes only.   This is not a request for proposal submission.  It is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources.  Interested parties responding to this announcement shall indicate whether they are a large, small, or small disadvantaged business in relation to NAICS Code 541710.  The Government reserves the right to set this action aside for small business.  Interested parties are invited to submit a Statement of Capabilities (SOC) to the Government for evaluation in response to this announcement in accordance with Numbered Note 25 (see below Numbered Notes).  In addition to Numbered Note 25, the following must be addressed in your SOC: Experience with beta-gamma and/or other radiation detectors, QNX experience, Radiation Safety, Course development/training experience, a list of relevant contracts including contract number, contracting officers name and number and a brief description.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

18.	THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.  The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD intends to procure CLS, consisting of Airframe Depot, Engine Depot and Site Support services, for Navy and Marine C-9B/DC-9 aircraft, USAF C-9 aircraft and one NASA C-9 aircraft.  The Navy and Marines currently operate 17 C-9Bs and 2 DC9s, USAF operates 4 C-9As and 3 C-9Cs, and NASA operates 1 DC-9aircraft.   There are three distinct efforts to be procured under this CLS solicitation (Airframe Depot, Engine Depot, and Site Support). (a) Site support at; Atlanta NAS, Norfolk NAS, Whidbey Island NAS, Willow Grove NAS, Cherry Point MCAS, Scott AFB, and Andrews AFB.  The site support effort consists of issuing parts and materials, assembling kits, receiving items for repair or overhaul, and providing replenishment services at each on-site storeroom.  The Government owns a considerable inventory of parts that are managed by the site support contractor. (b) Airframe depot maintenance services necessary to meet the C-9 aircraft operational requirements (SDLMs, PDMs, MTIs) and unscheduled maintenance.  Also included will be field team maintenance that occurs away from the Contractor’s designated depot facility, via Contractor Field Teams or Contractor selected Subcontractors and Vendors.  Note that two Navy DC-9s are slated for retirement during this performance period but will require normal services until that time.  (c) Engine depot services of Pratt & Whitney JT8D-9A engines such as unscheduled and scheduled engine shop visits.  Also included is field team support for repairs away from the depot facility. (d) Also to be included in this solicitation is limited material management services for the Navy C-9 simulator/trainer located at Colorado Springs, Colorado.  During the period of performance of this contract, aircraft will be retired (divestiture) and one or more sites may be closed.  The Navy is replacing the C-9s with C-40 aircraft.  This replacement schedule is driven by the C-40 aircraft acquisition schedule.  The C-40 acquisition schedule is volatile and subject to constant changes that cannot be predicted.

The contract will be for a base year plus 4 option years. Consideration is also being given to extending the length of the contract for up to ten years (base and up to nine options).  The contract will be a commercial like contract issued under the Federal Acquisition Regulations, Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items.  The Government believes that use of the Part 12 procedures will eliminate many of the potential barriers preventing or discouraging commercial companies from considering this requirement.  It will be an indefinite delivery type contract with a minimum ordering requirement for the base year only that is yet to be determined. The Government will place orders for site support, aircraft depot maintenance, engine depot maintenance and related work as part of the ordering provisions of the contract.  The contract will include the ability to order modification work for aircraft or engine modifications but the Government makes no assertion that this type of work will be done on this proposed contract.  The C-9 aircraft is the military version of the commercial DC-9 series aircraft manufactured by McDonnell Douglas Corporation and is an FAA type-certificated DC-9-32F aircraft. Parts and material are commercially available. Manuals and maintenance documentation will be provided to the contractor upon award, however; the contractor must obtain a licensing agreement with the OEM for engineering support. All contractor facilities must be Aircraft Repair Station licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) Part 145 to participate in this effort. 

A draft solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR website in the JUL/AUG 05 timeframe.  Various RFP documents will also be posted prior to and after the draft RFP.  Accordingly, companies should continuously monitor the NAVAIR web site at www.navair.navy.mil.  Then click on “Doing Business” and then “Open Solicitations.”   Formal RFP release is set for OCT 05 with proposal submittal due in early JAN 06.  Contract award is planned for JUN/JUL 06 to allow for a 90 day phase-in period for a new contractor, if applicable, with site and depot efforts to begin in OCT 06 (Government FY 07).

QUESTION FOR INDUSTRY –  We request that responses to the following question be provided by 2 MAY 2005 to support release of the draft RFP in the JUL/AUG timeframe:  
1. As part of this announcement, the Government requests your input on use of a contract that is six to ten years in length.  Please provide your assessment of advantages and/or disadvantages as well as pricing concerns and other terms and conditions that you believe would be critical to a contract longer then five years.   

Responses should be forwarded to Department of the Navy, Naval Air Systems Command, RADM William A. Moffett Building, Attn:  Jason Lev, CODE:  AIR-2.4.3.1, 47123 Buse Road, Bldg, 2272, Patuxent River, MD 20670-1607 or Jason.lev @navy.mil.  Electronic responses are preferred.  Submitted documentation, upon delivery, becomes the property of the U.S. Government.  Submissions will not be returned.  THIS PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT, NOR WILL THE GOVERNMENT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY INDUSTRY.

However, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.

It is important that the provider be able to provide land and agronomic services as well as pollinating labor to provide a quality product.  Fertility, irrigation, and selection of farm chemicals are very important; the provider must work with maize curatorial staff in Ames to ensure that the chemicals selected are appropriate for the germplasm.  Phytosanitary inspection and certification of the field is required prior to harvest to ensure our ability to distribute the seeds. Companies with demonstrated capability and financial capacity to provide this service must submit a written substantive statement outlining the company’s capabilities to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of publication of this notice.  This is not a request for proposal nor is a solicitation available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The proposed acquisition is directed to TMI pursuant to the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii) and (b)(2)(ii), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This acquisition will be a follow-on contract to the current Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL) effort by TMI under contract DASG60-98-C-0044.  TMI developed these unique simulations/testbeds and a prototype of the RDSIS and CTI under contract DASG60-98-C-0044. The government has determined that no source other than TMI has the requisite expertise and experience with these unique imulations/testbeds to provide the required follow-on effort without unacceptable delay to the THAAD System development program and unn ecessary duplication of previously incurred costs which would not be recovered through competition.  A CPAF contract for twelve months with four twelve month options is anticipated for this effort.  This effort is open to foreign competition at the subcont ract level.  Point of contact is U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN:  SMDCCM-CT/Cathy H. Hill.  See Note 22.

Visitors will be permitted to take pictures of any visible part of the aircraft but may NOT take any picture that includes the Air Force flight line, aircraft or facilities.  








The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB), FL, has a requirement for a tail-mounted scanning dual-beam X-band research radar system to be used on the NOAA Gulfstream G-IVSP aircraft. NOAA presently anticipates award of a fixed price contract no later than September 2005.  The contract will have a design phase with Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews, followed by a construction and installation phase.  The contract may also require the contractor to use earned value measurement and cost performance monitoring (EVM/CPM).

The Doppler radar system will be used to obtain detailed wind field information for initialization of the National Weather Service (NWS) Hurricane Weather and Research Forecast (HWRF) model.  The Doppler weather radar system shall have the following characteristics:  (1) reflectivity accuracy of ~1dBZ; (2) a radial velocity accuracy of ~1m/s; (3) a vertical resolution of 1 km; (4) a maximum horizontal unambiguous range of at least 50 km; (5) a maximum  rotational rate of at least 10 rpm (60 degrees/sec) to provide target horizontal (along-track) data spacing resolution of no more than 1.5km; (6) a maximum sampled gate length of 150 m; and (7) a total space displacement that permits it to fit within a new tail radome approximately 39 inches in diameter.  The Doppler radar system will interface with a data path and quality control system currently under development by NOAA.  In addition, a Government-provided stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) must be incorporated into the new tail radome enclosure.  The aircraft is FAA certified and maintains a valid airworthiness certificate.  The installation of the tail radar unit will involve physical modification of the aircraft that will affect its flight characteristics and weight balance.  Such modifications must be accomplished in conformance with the original equipment manufacture’s flight envelope specifications and must comply with FAA certification requirements for the specific aircraft type and mode of operation.  The modified G-IV aircraft is required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations in the Code Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Part 25, 14 CFR Part 36 and 14 CFR Part 91.  The original equipment manufacturer has retained most rights in data for the aircraft.  Performance of this work must be accomplished so as to have as little impact as possible on availability of the G-IV aircraft to perform mandated hurricane, winter storm and other meteorological reconnaissance and research.  Windows of availability of the aircraft for modification and testing exist for 2-3 months in the late Spring and 1-2 months in late Fall of each year.  Delivery of the complete tail radar installation is required not later than July 2007.  This requirement will provide for data collection and characterization by NOAA during the 2007 hurricane season, with full system certification and operational use in the 2008 hurricane season.  NOAA anticipates establishment of a ground mockup system at AOC in order to facilitate Doppler radar system testing and integration with the SFMR and data collection systems.  

In order to ensure that small businesses have a fair opportunity to participate in this acquisition, NOAA will use the Small Business Cascading Evaluation Preference Process.  This cascading set-aside preference provision is included in this Request for Proposals to notify large businesses that, if a sufficient number of eligible small businesses submit highly qualified offers; large businesses may not be considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to make either a full set-aside award or a partial set-aside award depending on the number and acceptability of responses received from small businesses in the evaluation.  The Department of Commerce (DOC) requires that all contractors doing business with Government be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR A SECURITY INFORMATION MANAGER (SIM) TOOL TO MANAGE NETWORK AND COMPUTER SECURITY INFORMATION AT TIER 3 DOD FACILITIES

1.0	SUBJECT

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) about available Security Information Managers (SIMs) that could potentially be deployed at Tier 3 Department of Defense (DOD) facilities and used to manage network and computer security information collected by disparate types of security sensors and applications on DOD computers and networks.  

A SIM is a product designed to automate the collection of event log data from security devices and applications and help users make sense of it through a central management console.  SIMs aggregate and normalize data from disparate security and network devices, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), routers, firewalls, database servers, packet filtering routers, antivirus software, Syslog servers, and vulnerability detection software.  SIMs perform correlation and prioritization of the data, and may also automate various processes performed by incident handlers, such as the categorization of events, collection of events into incidents, and generation of reports.  This definition includes several sub-categories of software or applications that will be addressed clearly in the requirements documentation.

2.0	DESCRIPTION

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission assigned to the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), is seeking information from industry, academia, and Government that will assist in the deployment of a software and/or appliance SIM product solution at DOD Tier 3 locations to assist in enhancing the CND posture of the DOD computer network systems.  The term “Tier 3” is defined as follows:

The DOD is organized into three hierarchical tiers to conduct CND.  Tier 1 provides DOD-wide CND operational direction or support to all DOD Components.  Tier 2 provides DOD Component-wide (i.e., Military Service-wide) or Theater-wide operational direction or support and responds to direction from Tier 1.  Tier 3 provides local operational direction or support to lower echelon Military Service entities and responds to direction from a designated Tier 2 entity.  Tier 1 entities include the CDRUSSTRATCOM and subordinate entities such as JTF-GNO, the CND Service Certification Authorities (DISA and NSA), the CND Law Enforcement and Counterintelligence Center, and the National Security Incident Response Center.  Tier 2 includes CND Service Providers (CNDSPs) designated by Heads of Components to coordinate Component-wide CND.  Tier 3 entities consist of camps, posts, bases, and stations, and include all entities responding to direction from DOD Component Tier 2 CNDSPs, e.g., local network and security control centers (NOSCs) or Systems Control Centers (SYSCONS) that manage and control information systems, networks and services, either forward deployed as tactical units or at fixed DOD Installations.  

DISA is in search of product solution that can address the requirements below for possible further evaluation.

<DESC>This is a request for information / sources sought announcement to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market. The Air Force Metrology Calibration Detachment is considering a purchase of a set of three Mini Fixed Point Cells and two Furnaces to be used in the calibration of precision Platinum Resistance Thermometer
probes that are less than 17 inches, the minimum length necessary to fit the full size cells for proper immersion.  The specific
cells shall include Tin, Zinc, and Indium.  They shall be able to accommodate probes as short as 6 inches in length.  The Tin, Zinc, and Indium Mini Fixed Point Cells shall provide the respective reference temperature points to allow for the highest
accuracy calibration possible at the AFPSL for PRTs that cannot fit the full size cells.  The mini cells will enable the AFPSL
to  calculate calibration coefficients to ITS 90 specifications and thus increase the accuracy of the calibrations for these shorter probes. Offerors responding to this sources sought market research must (1) state whether they are a small or large business,  (2) indicate if they are a small disadvantaged or woman-owned business, 8(a) firm, or a historically black college or university or minority institution (HBCU/MI), or a historically underutilized business zone (HUB Zone) small business; (3) advise if you have the item on a GSA schedule,  (4) provide information concerning the technical capabilities of the product you are interested in offering, including commercial literature/brochures.

<DESC>This is a request for information / sources sought announcement to identify potential sources and gather information on current capabilities within the market. The Air Force Metrology Calibration Detachment is considering a purchase of a acoustic and electrical calibration of Sound Level Meters, acoustic calibrators, pistonphones and microphones in accordance to
national and international standards.  Test Signals are in compliance with IEC 651, 804,  ANSI S1.4, and OIML R88.  Fast and
accuarate calibration of ANSI S1.4 Type 1 and 2 Sound Level Meters.  Fast and accurate calibration of sound calibrators in
accordance with ANSI Std S1.40.  If the SLM under test has a bus interface, then setup and reading of data from the SLM is performed via the bus.  If the SLM has a DC output, and if a satisfactory relationship between the SLM's display and the DC Output is established, then the test can be run semi-automatically.  Tests of octave and fractional octave filters in accordance with IEC 1260.  Choice to perform frequency response calibration of microphones using electrostatic or acoustical methods, will be available during the calibration.

<SOLNBR>AFNWCA-003

<ARCHDATE>05032005
<CONTACT>William Foster, Contracting Officer, Phone 505-846-5935, Fax 505-846-6022, Email william.foster@kirtland.af.mil
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) solicits information on potential agent defeat weapon (ADW) concepts and technologies capable of neutralizing bulk quantities of chemical and biological warfare (CBW) agents in production and storage.  The Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency (AFNWCA) will use this information in support of the Anti-Biological/Chemical (ABC) weapon Phase 1 concept assessment, an internal, government-conducted study.  The purpose of this study is to explore advanced weapon concepts for effectiveness in neutralizing bulk CBW agents and minimizing, or negating, collateral effects from released CBW agents and the weapon itself.  For concept planning purposes, assume bulk neutralization is defined between 50% and 100% neutralization of CBW agent in storage or production.  Neutralization is defined here as the ability to make a biological or chemical agent non-viable so that it is no longer harmful to people or the environment.

1.  Concept and technology submittals should address the ability to:

a) Have increased effectiveness over currently fielded conventional, nuclear, and ADW systems, or those under development, in both target lethality and minimizing collateral effects;

b) Effectively attack a variety of CBW targets, agent types/forms, and containers/munitions;

c) Overcome intelligence uncertainty (i.e., target unknowns);

d) Integrate as an “all-up” round (e.g., potential bomb bodies, guidance and control components, arming and fuzing subsystems, etc.);

e) Deliver/launch from current Air Force delivery platforms.

2.  The ABC Phase 1 study team encourages weapon system developers and integrators to become involved with this process by responding to this RFI.  The RFI response can consist of pre-existing product documentation, but should preferably be organized and presented in accordance with this RFI.

3.  This RFI seeks information to help the ABC Phase 1 study team make useful and efficient analyses of potential weapon concepts and assess the ability of the weapons community to develop and produce a bulk neutralization ADW system(s) that meets Air Force counter-CBW requirements.  Please consider the purpose of this RFI when responding so your time is spent on addressing the issues in paragraph 1.  Respondents may consider areas not explicitly asked for if they feel the information provides useful guidance.  However, weapon concepts submitted that do not specifically address bulk neutralization (i.e., accomplish only target destruction, disruption, or denial through facility structural damage, functional defeat, CBW container damage, agent leakage) may not be considered.

4.  Organizations responding to this RFI shall:

a) Designate a single contact within that organization for receipt of all subsequent communications

b)  Notify the government of intent to submit a white paper

5.  Response to this RFI must be received at AFNWCA no later than 5:00 PM US Mountain Standard Time May 2, 2005.

6.  The following outline is offered to assist in the development of your response.  You should include:

a) A cover letter that includes a brief summary of your response and indicates if supporting documentation is included.

b) A white paper submitted in electronic and paper format is the preferred response.  It must address all the areas in paragraphs 1 and 6c.  UNCLASSIFIED or CLASSIFIED white papers and supporting documents should be marked appropriately and mailed to the following address:

AAC/NW
Bldg 20325
Attn: Document Control 
1551 Wyoming Blvd SE
Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5617 

c) Descriptions of the following:

i)   Neutralization mechanism(s) and weapon output(s)
ii)  Proposed delivery method(s)
iii) Estimated weights/volumes of weapon concept and components
iv) Technical readiness level, including technological issues to resolve
v)  List of references containing technical data on the concept or technology

d) Appropriate proprietary markings if applicable.

7.  Although the ABC Phase 1 study team does not limit the size of responses, you are asked to consider that the team will rely upon resources with limited time availability to review these responses.  In order to assure that your response receives the attention it deserves, you are asked to consider limiting the size of your response to no more than 10 pages (not counting any supporting documentation).  If you consider supporting documentation to be necessary, please indicate which portions of the supporting documentation are relevant to this RFI.

8.  Responders to this RFI may be requested to participate in a Government/Industry Information Exchange day following closeout of this request.

9.  This RFI does not obligate the government in any manner for any future acquisitions.  This is not a notice of intent to contract.  The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or otherwise pay for information solicited.

10.  All communications regarding this RFI should be sent to the contacts below.

<DESC>This sources sought is for information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S government.  The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) seeks to identify potential sources that offer a commercially available automated airframe/engine discrepancy data collection tool for use in various maintenance cycles (i.e., Standard Depot Level Maintenance, Integrated Maintenance Concept, etc.).  NAVAIR desires to acquire a Site Enterprise License (unlimited users), supporting both internal and external users, for each Naval Air Depot at Jacksonville, North Island, Cherry Point, and auxiliary locations.

A major segment of the NAVAIR depot maintenance cycles, which are multi-phase processes, is the examination and evaluation (E&E) portion when depot personnel attempt to identify “over-and-above” (i.e., non-routine) work and related material requirements.  The tool, which should be web-based and able to run on both desktop and pen-tablet personal computers, shall be required to interface with the NAVAIR depots’ system of record for maintenance, repair, and overhaul (Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) software suite).

The discrepancy data collection tool effort will require sources to interact closely with the NAVAIR Depot Maintenance System (NDMS) Headquarters at Patuxent River Naval Air Station (NAS), Patuxent River, MD; the NAVAIR depots at Jacksonville, FL, North Island, CA, and Cherry Point, NC; and various remote naval maintenance facilities and contractor locations throughout the United States.  The estimated overall period of performance for this effort will be up to five (5) years.  Interested qualified parties shall demonstrate the capability to provide the required airframe/engine discrepancy data collection product by providing an unclassified Statement of Capability (SOC) on company letterhead, not to exceed twenty (20) pages in length (single-spaced, 12 point font).  Interested parties will also be required to complete a Functionality/Requirements Matrix, which can be obtained by contacting Michele Glampe, Contract Specialist, at michele.glampe@navy.mil or 301-995-4046.

The information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding upon the government.  The government will not be responsible for SOC preparation costs.  Note that submissions will not be returned.  Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 27 April 2005.  Responses can be submitted electronically to michele.glampe@navy.mil.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) is conducting a market survey to determine the availability and potential technical capability of small business firms as defined by NAICS Code 54170 to perform as a Clinical Coordinating Center.  The overall objectives of this research are to utilize the prospective study design to identify risk factors playing a protective or harmful role for cardiovascular and lung disease and sleep disorders in Hispanic populations, and to determine the role of acculturation in the prevalence and development of these diseases.  Longitudinal cohort studies in Hispanic populations will provide the data necessary to develop prevention programs for disease in the Hispanics as well as the entire US population. 

To achieve these objectives the study will identify four geographical areas in the US of persons of Hispanic origin with stable population and strong community structure and organization representing the major Hispanic groups in the U.S. (Mexican-American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, Central/South American).  Each area will have a field center which will identify, sample and recruit up to 4000 persons of Hispanic origin from each of areas for participation in a longitudinal study of cardiovascular and lung diseases (up to 16,000  persons).  The field centers will each conduct a detailed examination of these study participants including fasting blood draw, questionnaires, and other procedures and will conduct an annual contact, consisting of a brief questionnaire, of these persons following the initial examination.  The field centers will also identify new coronary heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) events that have occurred following the initial examination, will identify acute exacerbations of asthma requiring ER care or hospitalization, and will review and adjudicate medical information from hospital, physician and other records.   Finally study investigators will develop innovative hypotheses, perform data analysis, and produce publications from this study; provide community education and feedback regarding information from the study itself;  provide information to improve the health of the communities in general; provide training for minority investigators; and provide opportunities for ancillary studies funded by other mechanisms by establishing collaborations and publicizing the potential for these opportunities.  

Necessary functions of the Clinical Coordinating Center will include active participation in the development of the study protocol and pilot testing procedures;  leadership in organizing and conducting the centralized training and certification of study personnel; design and implementation of data collection procedures; design, implementation and maintenance of quality control procedures including assessment of reproducibility, validity, bias and drift in laboratory measurements in this study with 4 field centers; design of forms (including informed consent documents), Manuals of Operation, data entry and recruitment tracking computer programs, data bases and web sites for use by all Centers participating in the study; generation and enhancement of applications of appropriate statistical methods of analysis and presentation of data collected during the study; leadership in manuscript writing and publication; and establishment and maintenance of subcontracts to laboratories and reading centers.  

Capability statements should demonstrate: 1) professional qualifications of scientific, managerial and technical personnel including medical, technical, statistical, computer, and administrative staff with relevant expertise in epidemiologic research;  2) the organizational flexibility to modify the labor mix to meet the changing demand on the resource;  3) evidence of prior administrative and scientific leadership as a multi-center epidemiology study coordinating center managing a study of this size (up to 16,000 participants);  4) evidence of leadership in first-authoring and publishing scientific papers in a collaborative study; 5) experience and expertise in design, implementation and maintenance of quality control procedures including assessment of reproducibility, validity, and bias and drift in laboratory measurements in large multi-center studies; 6) substantial experience pertinent to the development of protocols and management of a wide variety of large-scale multi-center epidemiology studies; 7) experience and expertise in the epidemiology of cardiovascular and lung diseases, and sleep disorders; 8) clinical expertise to determine appropriate levels for participant alerts and referrals, and actions required for participant safety; 9) experience in generation and enhancement of applications of appropriate statistical methods of analysis and interpretation of medical data; 10) access to a large capacity computer facility and networking to remote terminals, and experience in installing and maintaining such networks; 11) capability to subcontract to laboratories and reading centers; and 12) the firm?s status as a small business under NAICS Code 541710.  This is not a Request for Proposal.  The Government is not responsible for costs associated with preparing capability statements in response to this announcement.  Three copies of the material requested above should be submitted within 15 calendar days from the date of this publication.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR A SECURITY INFORMATION MANAGER (SIM) TOOL TO MANAGE NETWORK AND COMPUTER SECURITY INFORMATION AT TIER 3 DOD FACILITIES

1.0	SUBJECT

This document is a Request for Information (RFI) about available Security Information Managers (SIMs) that could potentially be deployed at Tier 3 Department of Defense (DOD) facilities and used to manage network and computer security information collected by disparate types of security sensors and applications on DOD computers and networks.  

A SIM is a product designed to automate the collection of event log data from security devices and applications and help users make sense of it through a central management console.  SIMs aggregate and normalize data from disparate security and network devices, such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), routers, firewalls, database servers, packet filtering routers, antivirus software, Syslog servers, and vulnerability detection software.  SIMs perform correlation and prioritization of the data, and may also automate various processes performed by incident handlers, such as the categorization of events, collection of events into incidents, and generation of reports.  This definition includes several sub-categories of software or applications that will be addressed clearly in the requirements documentation. 

Responses to this RFI are due NLT Monday, May 9, 2005, at 5:00PM Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) (GMT-4).

2.0	DESCRIPTION

The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), in support of the Computer Network Defense (CND) mission assigned to the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), is seeking information from industry, academia, and Government that will assist in the deployment of a software and/or appliance SIM product solution at DOD Tier 3 locations to assist in enhancing the CND posture of the DOD computer network systems.  The term “Tier 3” is defined as follows:

The DOD is organized into three hierarchical tiers to conduct CND.  Tier 1 provides DOD-wide CND operational direction or support to all DOD Components.  Tier 2 provides DOD Component-wide (i.e., Military Service-wide) or Theater-wide operational direction or support and responds to direction from Tier 1.  Tier 3 provides local operational direction or support to lower echelon Military Service entities and responds to direction from a designated Tier 2 entity.  Tier 1 entities include the CDRUSSTRATCOM and subordinate entities such as JTF-GNO, the CND Service Certification Authorities (DISA and NSA), the CND Law Enforcement and Counterintelligence Center, and the National Security Incident Response Center.  Tier 2 includes CND Service Providers (CNDSPs) designated by Heads of Components to coordinate Component-wide CND.  Tier 3 entities consist of camps, posts, bases, and stations, and include all entities responding to direction from DOD Component Tier 2 CNDSPs, e.g., local network and security control centers (NOSCs) or Systems Control Centers (SYSCONS) that manage and control information systems, networks and services, either forward deployed as tactical units or at fixed DOD Installations.  

DISA is in search of product solution that can address the requirements below for possible further evaluation.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) Number HHSF200601 on Active Surveillance Programs in the United States for the Identification of Clinically Serious Adverse Events Associated with Medical Products 

BACKGROUND 

A vital part of FDA and CDER’s mission is to protect the public health.  The Office of Drug Safety (ODS) contributes to this effort by evaluating drug risks and promoting the safe use of drugs by the American people.  In 1999, the Task Force on Risk Management’s “Report to the FDA Commissioner” and the HHS Office of the Inspector General’s “Report to the FDA Commissioner” both identified the need for greater post marketing pharmacovigilance for prescription drugs.  In response to these reports, FDA devoted greater resources to the area of post marketing safety and has expanded the roles and responsibilities of ODS within CDER. 

The statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA, Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products. 

FDA currently has several tools available to address post marketing safety issues.  These tools include a passive surveillance system for adverse events related to drug therapy; several complementary drug utilization databases; and (historically) indirect access to US claims-based health encounter data for pharmacoepidemiology studies. Passive reporting systems provide limited information, though, suffering from underreporting, attribution problems, reporting biases, and a lack of denominator information. To strengthen and complement these resources, FDA seeks information related to “active surveillance” activities in the US, either ongoing or proposed.  

DEFINITION OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE

Active surveillance has been defined by some as regular periodic collection of case reports from health care providers or facilities; in contrast with passive surveillance which refers to case reports provided at the discretion of the health care provider .  Due to the complexity of drug safety surveillance, FDA would like to broaden this concept to include data collected from other sources, in addition to traditional case reports used in other types of public health surveillance.  Surveillance programs can focus on certain events (or outcomes) or on certain drugs of interest.   

There are at least three strategies that can be used for the active surveillance of drug-related adverse events.  Drug-based surveillance systems look at large numbers of patients exposed to new molecular entities (NMEs) after their launch for all or specified adverse events.  This type of system can also examine the utilization of drugs and modes of clinical practice.  Setting-based surveillance systems are set up in hospitals or emergency rooms and capture all or specified adverse events that occur in relation to drug use and present for treatment at these facilities.  Disease-based systems set up comprehensive disease-specific registries for selected drug-induced diseases. Each methodology is useful, so the ideal program could include more than one methodology.

HISTORY OF ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE

In the late 1960s, FDA initiated a jointly funded active surveillance program with NIH and a large health maintenance organization to develop a medical record linkage system.  This system was the first attempt at linking scanned forms from doctor visits, laboratory test information, electronic pharmacy data, and hospitalization information. The effort failed because computer technology was still in its infancy and it was extremely labor intensive (and hence expensive) to enter the information.  In the 1970s, several efforts were made to collect drug exposure information from patients hospitalized for a variety of conditions.  Nurse abstractors reviewed charts at hospitals around the country to identify and interview selected patients about their prescription and nonprescription drug exposure history.  The early programs did not meet the FDA’s needs for a number of reasons including; lack of funding, underdeveloped computer technology, and low yield of new information.  

More recently, other surveillance systems include the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) jointly funded by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA. Both of these systems collect adverse drug event information from emergency departments in a representative sample of U.S. hospitals and can be used to make national estimates.  DAWN and NEISS are examples of setting-based surveillance systems.  In addition, FDA has co-sponsored pilot development of a drug-based surveillance system which explores the feasibility of using data mining techniques to identify safety signals in automated claims databases.  FDA remains interested in learning about other systems of all three types that might complement these programs.

DESCRIPTION 

This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  It is not a request for proposal/bid/quotation and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned. 

In general, FDA is interested in,
1)	Systems that can provide any of the following information:
a)	Rapid identification of drug/adverse event associations; 
b)	Systems to actively identify cases of selected adverse events of interest, possibly in relation to specific drugs of interest; these may or may not be automated.  These systems would not necessarily require health care practitioners to make causal attribution of the event to a drug.  Access to medical records by local system personnel (i.e., not FDA), while not mandatory, is highly desirable.
c)	Systems that are able to measure and/or estimate incidence rates based on signals of possible drug safety problems originating from adverse reaction reports received by FDA

2)	Systems that are nationally representative; or at least include a multi center or multi state population or network.  

Specific systems might include,
1)	A  focus on the three strategies listed above, for example, 
a)	Setting-based systems that would  allow FDA to monitor selected health care settings such as acute care hospitals (or specific departments within a hospital, e.g., emergency departments, operating rooms, transplant centers, outpatient clinics, or dialysis services), long-term care facilities (e.g., nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals, or rehabilitation centers), urgent care centers, outpatient surgical centers, freestanding outpatient specialty clinics (e.g., those that treat HIV patients, family planning services), physicians’ offices, etc., for the occurrence of adverse events of interest.
b)	Drug-based systems that would allow identification of all adverse events associated with selected prescription or nonprescription drugs.  Information about patients prescribed these drugs would be used to identify signals of previously unknown adverse events.
c)	Outcome-based systems that would allow identification of specific acute outcomes for which drug therapy is frequently considered as a potential cause, e.g., acute liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, serious blood dyscrasias, serious skin reactions, anaphylaxis, QT prolongation,  GI bleeding.  Other outcomes of interest may be more difficult to ascertain because they occur a long time after the start of drug therapy and may make attribution more difficult.  Examples of these outcomes include congenital anomalies and certain cancers.  
2)	A focus on  particular safety areas that traditionally have been difficult to study, such as, 
a)	Abuse or misuse of prescription drugs that have serious public health consequences  
b)	Drug-related medication errors
c)	Drug-related death surveillance
d)	Pediatric and geriatric  populations

Interested organizations are invited to submit a description of their perspective on existing or potential active surveillance program components and information describing their ability to operationalize those components.  In addition, these submissions should contain cost estimates for FDA to access or develop these systems for day to day use in drug safety surveillance.  Submitted information could include a discussion addressing some or all of the following criteria, described in a comprehensive review on surveillance systems :  

Simplicity
Flexibility
Data Quality
Acceptability
Sensitivity
Positive Predictive Value
Representativeness
Timeliness
Stability

<SUBJECT>U.S. Department of Energy's Sixth Annual Small Business Conference, June 12-15, 2005
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) will host its Sixth Annual National Small Business Conference on June 12-15, 2005, in Nashville, Tennessee at the Gaylord Opryland Resort and Convention Center. The purpose of the conference is to reach out to small businesses -- including Small Disadvantaged, Women-owned, 8(A), HUB Zone and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned businesses -- to assist them in contracting with DOE and its major contractors.  The conference plays a major role in providing procurement guidance and contracting opportunities to small business. The conference will bring together representatives of the Department, its prime contractors, our network of National Laboratories, and several other Federal agencies to provide valuable information about business lines and upcoming contracting opportunities at DOE and at other agencies as well. The Department continues to be committed to fully engaging small businesses, including small disadvantaged, 8(a), women-owned businesses, HUB Zone, and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned small business concerns, in DOE's core missions.  DOE purchases over $19 billion worth of goods and services annually in the areas of facility management, remediation, construction, research and development, management and scientific consulting, plate work manufacturing, administrative services, data processing, security, engineering, and waste treatment and disposal.  Features of this yearâ€™s conference include: -- Plenary sessions featuring prominent government, corporate and business leaders who will discuss ways small businesses can have better access to DOE procurement opportunities; -- A business exposition providing an opportunity for businesses to showcase their products and services to hundreds of corporate and government attendees, including DOEâ€™s Prime Contractors; -- A Matchmaking Forum providing a unique opportunity to schedule one-on-one meetings with procurement representatives from DOEâ€™s Prime Contractors and share in over $1 billion of possible subcontracting opportunities within FY 2005; -- Charity Golf Tournament providing a fun opportunity to play a top golf course, network with other conference attendees, and help a very worthy cause. Tournament takes place on Sunday, June 12th. DOE has received positive reviews on the previous conferences. This year's conference will continue to provide the essential information and guidance needed to do business with the Department.  It is through outreach activities such as this that the Department finds small businesses with the capabilities to match its contracting opportunities.   For more information or to register, please visit the conference website at http://www.smallbusiness-outreach.doe.gov/ .  DOE looks forward to your participation.

<SUBJECT>B -- Request For Information In-Flight Survey Program
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), International Trade Administration (ITA), Office of Travel & Tourism Industries (OTTI) in support of goals established by the President of the United States, is seeking information from industry that will assist in the evaluation of its current program for surveying international travelers to and from the United States. This Request for Information (RFI) invites interested parties to respond to the attached In-Flight Survey (IFS) Program Background Document and Questionnaire. Responses and comments are being solicited from the travel industry sectors (airlines, airports, travel related associations, consultants, destination marketing organizations, tourism boards, research Contractors, etc.) and other interested parties as part of the Government’s market assessment to identify new methodologies that exist for conducting surveys.  
The primary purpose of the Survey of International Air Travelers is to obtain the necessary data used by the Government to estimate travel and passenger fare exports and imports for the country.  International trade data from the Survey is also used to calculate the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the country.  The program provides information, while safeguarding individual privacy, about U.S. resident and non-U.S. resident international travelers and trip characteristics. The information is used by the Government to develop public policies and by the private sector to improve resource management.  Information obtained through this RFI will be used to formulate possible improvements and/or alternate solutions in the program’s methodology and to develop requirements for a formal Request For Proposal (RFP) for surveying services. Respondents are asked to provide any input they feel will improve the data the Federal Government collects on international travel to and from the USA, with a focus on assisting the Government in obtaining the maximum return on the money invested in this program.  Interested parties may propose alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements.  The Government encourages both rigorous and yet creative solutions, by thinking “outside the box” when responding to this RFI.  Interested parties are encouraged to provide the Government with information on their company along with detailed information on how they would approach conducting this program.  Section 5, of the attached document is an open area for suggestions, comments, concerns, issues, questions, other methodologies OTTI should consider using, and/or any other ideas the industry may want to share with Commerce.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement is a sole source notice constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Sole Source Requirement for mission unique consoles (RF-19-S-USB)from MARCO, Inc., Birmingham, Alabama.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: After reviewing other vendors product MARCO was the only vendor that had a standard product that met the specifications of our existing console design in our MDC.	This console design is critical to our launch operations.  MARCO's product accommodated the current Enhanced Telemetry Display System (ETDS) and equipment used for operations. A change to another vendor's product would require a recertification of the new product to ensure it meets all requirements.  This product also fits the size and spacing requirements of our existing facilities.  Any change in size would impact the available space in the MDC and require a reevaluation to ensure all life safety codes and fire codes are still met. Any new product would also need to be evaluated for operations and ergonomic function.  This product is part of a time critical cutover of our MDC at Vandenberg Air Force Base.  There is a limited operational window for the installation of this equipment. Given the current time constraints a design and build type of this procurement, it is not feasible to integrate another console design into the existing console design and would impact our operations, if procured from another vendor.  This determination was made after an extensive canvassing of various technology industry personnel for alternative suppliers and yielded no other competitive suppliers of the referenced product.  It is in the best interest of NASA to sole source this procurement to MARCO who has the only standard product that meets the requirements of an existing console design and time requirements of the fully operational MDC. The provisions and clauses in this solicitation are those in effect through FAC 01-26. This procurement is a total small business set-aside. See Note 1.   The NAICS Code (334310) and the small business size standard for this procurement is 500 employees.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer of mission suitability, which shall be considered by the agency.  However, based on the information above, the government does not anticipate any offers that can meet the requirements. Delivery to Vandenberg AFB is required within the government's schedule.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9. Offers for the items(s) described above are due by COB, 5:00PM. EST on April 13, 2005 to OP-LS, KSC, FL 32899, solicitation number PR4200107308, FOB destination to VAFB, proposed delivery schedule, discount/payment terms, warranty duration (if applicable), taxpayer identification number (TIN), identification of any special commercial terms, and be signed by an authorized company representative.

<DESC>This is a Sole Source, combined synopsis and solicitation procurement is for a follow-on commercial service contract. The original system was developed with unique, proprietary software and only one contractor has the technical ability and personnel to properly perform the service. To award this contract to another contractor would cause software compatibility issues and impact the over all mission of the Government. Dugway Proving Ground requests a non-personal service contract for the upgrade of six  each chamber controllers of climatic test equipment located at Dugway Proving Ground. Installation of the wireless controllers may be performed at contractors facility or the area known as the Test Area (West Desert Test Center) west of Dugway, UT.  When  work is performed at the contractors facility the contractor is responsible for transporting the chamber to and from the test area. In these cases, the Contractor shall be reimbursed at cost only, for shipping expenses. The area known as the test area in cludes Carr Facility, Ditto Technical Center, White Sage Mortar Range, German Village Artillery Range, and all other accessible areas within a 30-mile radius of Ditto Technical Center. The reason for this extended area is that the operational testing of th e new controllers, when installed, are required to operate from remote locations back to the central data acquisition/control center. All other installation of new controllers shall be performed by the Contractors personnel at the chamber site (Carr Facil ity, German Village or in some remote location). Mobile chambers will be relocated to Carr Facility (or central location) for installation only when in the Governments best interest, and at the Governments discretion. Contractor personnel shall meet all s afety and security requirements for contractors operating at DPG. The only resources to be provided to the contractor are electrical service and use of DPG's vehicle wash. The service for this contract will consist of removing current controllers, then upg rading climatic test chambers with a touch screen interface with the capability of process controller, data logger, set point programmer and logic sequencer all in one unit with wireless Ethernet capability to send data to the existing Central Data Acquisi tion System. The new chamber controllers/programmers will have the following capabilities: Two RTD inputs for chamber temperature; two 4-20 mA for chamber relative humidity: refrigeration systems temperature and humidity monitoring; touch screen interface,  alphanumeric and video graphic trending display of chamber conditions. The controller must have the capability of controlling up to 20 loops using 4 independent programmers with 16 set points, with data being logged at the controller and at the central da ta acquisition system, at the same time using a wireless system. Data to be collected and transmitted are: chamber temperature, humidity, refrigeration system (static charge, high pressure, low pressure, and oil pressure), and monitoring of humidity system . The set point programmer function should provide 1 to 8 analog set point profiles and 1 to 16 output profiles on four separate time bases. Also, these chambers use electric resistance heaters, expendable refrigerant (liquid carbon dioxide), and mechanica l refrigeration to control temperature. Relative humidity is controlled using low-pressure steam injection, refrigerated wet bulb dehumidification, and regenerated desiccant drier dehumidification. These chambers consist of a 32 ft. utility trailer complet e with lights, brakes, etc.; a 12L X 7W X 7H ft. (nominal) stainless steel test chamber; equipment compartment, and the following installed equipment: Liquid CO2 piping; insulation; manual, automatic, and pressure relief valves; etc. 2 each 16 in. prop typ e fans with ¾ hp. motors; shafts; belts; bearings; etc. 9 each 1.7 kW low watt density stainless steel sheathed resistance heaters 7 ½ hp.

The following paragraphs list, reference, and describe the functions, characteristics, and major systems of the climatic chambers that the contractor will be equipping with new chamber controllers and wireless communication. The components are also described in the manufacturers operation and maintenance manuals for each of these climatic chambers. These manuals contain component equipment manufacturers literature on almost every component installed in or used in construction of the climatic chambe rs. However, neither this list nor the manuals lists every fastener, belt, electrical accessory, finishing material, light bulb, bulk construction material, gasket, seal, etc. of each climatic chamber.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to industry questions as follows:

Question 1.  Will you be accepting offers from contractors providing everything or can we participate in selected items.  In other words, we are interested in supplying the cable assemblies and connectors for this project. Are we able to submit our proposal for only those items only?

Answer 1.  There is only one item being solicited for and procured - the power supply with attached cables.  We do do not intend to procure items separately.  A separate proposal, if received, would be evaluated as non-compliant.

Question 2.  Please let us know how we may acquire the drawings for these items. 

Answer 2.  There are no drawings available.  All necessary data is included in the synopsis.

Proposals remain due 2:00 p.m. (EST) May 02, 2005.
