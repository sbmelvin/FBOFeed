<RESPDATE>093003
<ARCHDATE>03132004
<CONTACT>Michael W. Hargrove Contracting Officer 7037871367     Michael.Hargrove@mms.gov;
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE MINERALS MANAGEMENT SERVICE/GOV.WORKS, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA), SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.  A.  INTRODUCTION: The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB)   seeks concept papers that address technological innovations and/or process improvements that can be demonstrated to enhance our nation?s ability to quickly deploy and sustain our warfighters by air, anywhere in the world.  The AMB pursues innovation opportunities across the entire span of air mobility missions: Air Transportation (cargo and personnel), Air Drop, Air Refueling, Special Air Missions, and Aeromedical Evacuation.  This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition   in Contracting Act of 1984."  Responses shall reference Solicitation Number 72088 . THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 03, AND CONCEPT PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://www.amwc.af.mil/wcb.  There will be no other solicitation issued for this topic.  B. OBJECTIVE:  The AMB seeks ideas and solutions that reduce mobility response time and/or air mobility cost to the Department of Defense, reduce the deployable support structure, increase combat capability and effectiveness during deployment, and/or enable USAF members who support air mobility missions to do their jobs better, cheaper, and/or quicker.  AMB?S PRIMARY FOCUS IS THE IDENTIFICATION, INVESTIGATION, AND DEMONSTRATION OF INNOVATIVE IDEAS, TECHNOLOGIES, AND CONCEPTS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF BEING FIELDED IN 18 MONTHS OR LESS.  AMB seeks first to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but has funds available to contract for several demonstrations costing as much as $400,000 each.  The AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers--frequently to the Commander of Air Mobility Command, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Transportation Command, and Chief of Staff of the USAF.  CURRENTLY, HIGH INTEREST AREAS INCLUDE: 1.)  Detection and defeat of radio frequency (RF) and infrared (IR) threats; 2.)  Automatic identification of friend or foe (IFF) onboard mobility aircraft; 3.)  Deployed and in-garrison force protection that includes threat detection, situational awareness, and mitigation measures in both conventional and weapon of mass destruction (WMD) environments; 4.)  Zero-visibility, zero-ceiling autonomous aircraft precision landing systems; 5.)  Aircraft and airfield operations under blacked-out conditions; 6.)  Broad band communication between airborne Aeromedical Evacuation personnel and either military or civilian aircraft and/or ground medical units; 7.)  Real time in-transit visibility (ITV) and total asset visibility (TAV); 8.)  Detection and defense against intrusion or attack of command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence (C4I) systems and networks; 9.)  Secure worldwide voice and data link communications for secure global C4I connectivity between mobility air forces (MAF), Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) aircraft, command and control (C2) centers, and mobility ground forces; and,  10.)  Fast cargo screening for detection of explosives. However, this BAA solicits concept papers with the potential to enhance Air Force operations within any element of air mobility operations, or their interfaces with the rest of the Defense Transportation System (DTS).  C. HOW TO RESPOND/ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:     (1)  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPOSALS AT THIS TIME; ONLY CONCEPT PAPERS WILL BE EVALUATED.  The purpose of the concept paper is to preclude effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.  (2)  Offerors are advised that only a warranted Contracting Officer is legally authorized to commit the government to an award under this BAA.  (3)  Security Requirements: every precaution must be taken to protect potentially sensitive or classified material.

If a submitter has any reason to suspect their concept may reference ideas or operations that require special protection, please contact Mr. Michael Corson at (609) 754-7609 prior to submission for additional guidance.  In general, potentially sensitive submissions should be sent via REGISTERED MAIL to the mailing address listed in Section D of this BAA.  Specific laws and regulations directing the proper methods for transmission of classified concepts may bind submitters who are supported by an accredited security office.  (4)  Successful offerors must comply with the Privacy Act, AFI 37-132.  (5)  Offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, if they have one.  (6)  Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations.

(7)  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.  (8)  Notice To Foreign Offerors: Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures and restrictions that could preclude their participation in this announcement.  (9)  The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract.  However, the cost may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in accordance with FAR 31.205-18.  D. CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  Each concept paper must address only a single concept and should describe the expected benefit(s) to the Air Force.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA) 03-20 NETWORKING IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS SOL: BAA03-20, CLOSING DATE: 1 March 2004 POC: Stephen Griggs, DARPA/ATO E-mail: sgriggs@darpa.mil, FAX: (703) 696-9781 Fax: (703) 696-9781 WEB: http://www.darpa.mil/ato/ E-MAIL: BAA03-20@darpa.mil 

PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND DESCRIPTION:
 
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is soliciting abstracts and proposals for DARPA’s Advanced Technology Office (ATO) to perform research, development, design, and testing to support the DARPA Networking in Extreme Environments (NETEX) program.  The goal of the NETEX Program is to create ultra-wideband (UWB) sensor and communication systems and support their integration into a wireless networking technology that enables robust connectivity in harsh military environments.  This BAA defines an UWB signal as one that at any point in time has a fractional bandwidth equal to or greater than twenty percent or a bandwidth greater than 500 MHz regardless of the fractional bandwidth.

An initial NETEX UWB study was conducted during fiscal years 2002-2003.  The objective of this initial study was to obtain an understanding of the electromagnetic interference (EMI) effects of UWB system operation on existing narrow band spectrum users and determine how they could be implemented in a manner that makes best use of their unique capabilities.  The initial study encompassed: 1) measuring the effects of ultra wideband system operation on existing military spectrum users and defining UWB system parameters for coexistence, 2) modeling the impact of UWB transmissions on narrowband receivers and providing a set of tools for analyzing the UWB interaction with legacy systems, and 3) developing UWB propagation and channel models.  

This phase of the NETEX Program will consist of three sub phases:

PHASE II, 1: Develop UWB Systems:  PHASE II, 1 will last 18 months and focus on the development of power efficient UWB communication systems that can coexist with legacy systems and intentional jammers. The UWB waveform for PHASE II, 1 will be implemented in the design space identified by the Spectral Mask that resulted from the work that was performed during the initial NETEX study.  The major development efforts required for PHASE II, 1 are improved detection, modulation, coding, interference excision techniques, simultaneous multi-function (comm., radar, timing and location), and an order of magnitude reduction in size and power.  UWB systems developed should achieve at least 10-3 uncorrected bit-error rate (BER) with multiple (minimum of three) in band interferers located within 20 meters distance from the UWB system. The interferers should have modulation, bandwidth and effective radiated power that are representative of legacy systems operating in the band of interest, and they should not cause harmful interference to the UWB system and vice-versa when all systems are operating.  

PHASE II, 2:  Develop UWB Network and Medium Access Control (MAC) Layers:  PHASE II, 2 will last 18 months and will focus on the development of algorithms, protocols and distributed control for robust, scalable ad-hoc networking that effectively shares the UWB channel among non-cooperating UWB systems. The result shall be a power efficient, precision time based ad-hoc network that is capable of self organization and robustness using software adaptation. The network will also provide modular design and open interfaces for “inter-stack” awareness and will provide a capability of simultaneous timing, location, ranging and communications. This will enable a new allocation of functions and different control of the network than is currently seen with the standard OSI model. The networking capabilities should be demonstrated for a multi-node UWB mobile ad-hoc network and it should be extensible to more than 10,000 nodes in an area that is 1 km2. 
PHASE II, 3: Demonstrate UWB Systems: PHASE II, 3 will last 24 months and consist of integration of systems designs and will include a series of experiments and demonstrations. The intent of these experiments is to demonstrate the military utility of UWB sensor and communications networks.

A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA  19101, ATTN:  DPSC-POL.  Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer.  (b) The Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below.  (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples).  In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory.  For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference.  (c) The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC-POL #215-737-7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing.  If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL.  In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled.  (d) If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal.  The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period.  The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

The cost of QL testing shall also be borne by the prime contractor.   (g) Shipment of component materials to the prime contractor need not be deferred pending test results except when shade approval is required (see paragraph (h)).  Cutting production lots without a passing QL test report on the corresponding samples is done at the contractor's own risk.  (h) Shade evaluation is acceptance testing.  Therefore, component lots may not be shipped to the prime contractor until the DPSC Laboratory accepts the shade of the material.

<DESC>The Single Integrated Air Picture System Engineering Task Force (SIAP SE TF), supported by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) Contracting Office, has a requirement for an  executable Unified Modeling Language (UML) Platform Independent Model (PIM) Development “tool” described in this solicitation, N00024-03-R-5134.  The Government seeks a commercially-available executable UML development “tool” that can be delivered within three (3) business days after contract award (including technical support personnel available onsite in Crystal City, VA, for five (5) business days to support installation and successful customer usage of the offeror’s computer programs. BACKGROUND:  The Department of Defense (DoD) has established a Single Integrated Air Picture System Engineering Task Force hereafter referred to as the SIAP SE TF.  The mission of the SIAP SE TF is to identify the mos t effective and efficient means to achieve a SIAP that satisfies the warfighter needs. The SIAP SE TF will satisfy this mission by implementing a disciplined system engineering process.  This process will yield recommendations for fielding a SIAP, which will lead to measurable improvements in warfighting capability. The SIAP SE TF must consider the entire spectrum of alternatives (including training and tactics, techniques, and procedures) to make recommendations on the most cost effective means to achieve the SIAP.  The SIAP is not the end-state; it is part of a larger construct that must be engineered so it can easily migrate toward, and support, a common tactical picture.  As such, it is recognized that the SIAP supports the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) mission areas involving the tactical employment of airpower. An incremental approach is needed to develop an d implement improvements to command and control of existing systems and the integrated architectures within which these systems operate while the SIAP is being developed. In the end, the product of the SIAP SE TF recommendations will be combat ready, operationally certified equipment and computer programs that enable the warfighter to build and maintain a SIAP, and inputs to tactics, techniques, and procedures necessary to operate the C2 components of an integrated system. The SIAP SE TF will not establish operational requirements, but will provide technical expertise to aid requirements development.  Requirements validation is the purview of the DoD Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) via the Joint Theater Air and Missile Defense (JTAMD) process and other relevant processes. PURPOSE:   The SIAP SE TF is building an executable UML model of a distributed system that s upports tactical battle management and command and control.  The model will completely and correctly describe the functionality that must be expressed by individual peers.  These peers must interact to meet specific capstone and operational capability requirements, including stringent requirements for mutual consistency, safety, reliability and availability. The approach used is based on the Object Management Group (OMG) Model Driven  Architecture (MDA), with specific emphasis on executable UML.  By separating functionality and implementation, SIAP SE TF is pursuing a path of complete conversion from executable UML to binary, loadable image files that operate on commercial and open source “middleware” and real-time operating systems.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with  additional information included in this notice.  Please, see the actual solicitation identified by N00024-03-R-5134 for complete details and requirements to be contained in your response and evaluated for award.

<CONTACT>Carol Brown 202-781-4875
<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), Program Executive Office, Littoral and Mine Warfare (PEO LMW), Naval Special Warfare Program Office (PMS NSW) is seeking potential assembly and software and hardware integration for production of the Hydrographic Reconnaissance Littoral Mapping Device (HRLMD) System.  The ability to validate integration of various sub-components and system software into working tactical units will also be required.  The system fabrication requires the ability to perform electronic assembly and check-out of Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) sub-components and produce the Hydrographic Reconnaissance Littoral Mapping Device (HRLMD) units. The HRLMD is an underwater diver hand-held unit that is a fully integrated sensor and navigation system used to conduct hydrographic reconnaissance.  The unit is neutrally buoyant, is approximately 17” long x 16” wide x 9” hig h, with an estimated weight of approximately 24 pounds without a battery attached.  It provides the ability to obtain a more accurate and expedient method of collecting, recording, analyzing, and transferring hydrographic reconnaissance data to the mission coordinator.  Navigational information is provided to the operator’s Diver Held Unit (DHU) using a Long Baseline (LBL) or dead reckoning methodology.  Transponder beacons are utilized in the LBL mode when operating within a predefined area.  Dead reckoning navigation methods use a combination of state-of-the-art Global Positioning System (GPS) technology and Doppler Sonar updates.  The DHU is also capable of recording and transferring underwater sonar images to a computer.  The Final Technical Data Package (TDP) developed by the Applied Research Laboratory: University of Texas (ARL:UT) at Austin is available in electronic ( CD-ROM) format upon request for both HRLMD system discs.  The TDP will provide sufficient information for the system, identifying the configuration and design assembly.  Potential sources are instructed to request the electronic TDP by submission of an email to brownca@navsea.navy.mil. Only firms who are on the certified contractor access list may receive such information.  Request for certification and registration can be obtained from the U.S. Canada Joint Certification Office, (formerly the Defense Logistics Service Center (DLSC), Federal Center) 74 Washington Avenue N, STE 7, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 (telephone number 1-888-352-9333).  The procurement process will not be delayed to allow for contractors to gain certification.

<DESC>17.	This is a combined synopsis/notice of intent to procure commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested for solicitation number NOI3038.  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-12.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is a small business set-aside (NAICS-541380). The Government intends to procure testing services from BaroFold Inc the only known distributor that holds the exclusive patent rights to “High Pressure Refolding of Protein Aggregates and Inclusion Bodies;” Patent No:  US 6,489,450 B2.  The contractor is to determine the conditions under which two candidate proteins (Pfs48 and Pvs48) can be refolded. The proteins would be characterized by a variety of methods to determine the extent of refolding.  I.) Preliminary Screen of Refolding Conditions: For each of the proteins, baseline experiments to establish the effect(s) of pressure, ionic strength, pH and temperature on yields of soluble proteins.  These studies will use variations around “baseline” conditions as follows:  Temperature:  25C; pressure: 1500 bar; pH 8.0 redox conditions: equimolar reduced and oxifized glutahtione, at a total concentration of 1 mM: ionic strength:  10 mM Tris, 40nM NaCl: protein concentration: 1 mg/ml.  Four levels in addition to the “baseline” will be used for each of the variables.  For example, temperatures of 1, 10, 25, 40 and 50 C will be used, in solutions where all other variables are held at “base case” values.  Likewise, levels for pressure will be 1000, 1250, 1500, 2000, 2500 bar.  Four levels of pH and ionic strength will also be chosen.  In addition, selected consolvent conditions will be tested (e.g. addition of low levels of urea, guanidine HCL, or arginine).  After contrifugation to remove insoluble fractions, soluble protein will be quantified by size exclusion chromatography, total protein assays (Bradford), and by SDS-PAGE using reducing and non-reducing conditions.  For the conbination of refolding conditions that yield high concentrations of soluble protein, high-pressure spectorscopies (high pressure deriviative UV spectroscopy, high pressure fluorescence spectroscopy, high pressure light scattering) will be used to characterize structural changes in the proteins as they are processed from aggregated to soluble species.  FTIR spectroscopy will be used to characterize protein secondary structure in the starting inclusion bodies, and compared with secondary structure measured by FTIR of the soluble fractions after high-pressure processing.  Structure of the soluble protein will also be characterized by derivative UV spectroscopy, fluorescence, and far- and near-UV circular dichroism.  In addition, correct formation of epitopcs in the resulting soluble fraction will be quantified using monoclonal antibody assays (Westerm Blotting and/or Elisa) in collaboration with NIH/NIAID researchers.  The proteins of interest contain disulfide bonds.  To increase the likelihood that the bonding pattern will result in correctly folded protein, the contractor will further refine these solution conditions by varying redox conditions.  Ratios of reduced to oxidized glutathione ranging from 1:10 to 10:1 will be tested, at levels of disulfide scrambling agents of 0.5, 1, and 5mM.  Similarly, other selected redox couples will also be tested.  After pressurization and depressurization, levels of soluble protein will be determined.  In addition, residula free cysteine in the soluble protein fraction will be quantified.  Two or three samples from selected conditions will be analyzed by tryptic digests and mass spectrometry to ascertain patterns of disulfide bonds within the pressure-processed proteins depending on data results.  For conditions of refolding/redox chosen, the contractor will measure the refolding kinetics and yields as a function of time and protein concentration.  Mathematical engineering models of the refolding reaction kinetics will be developed to predict rates of refolding and applied in order to optimize production of native protein.  These models will be compatible with the data generated for the specific protein.  II.) Deliverables:  A final report will be provided, within two weeks of completion of all lab procedures and data analysis, detailing the results of the experiments, and gives a description of attainable yields for high-pressure assisted refolding of each of the proteins.  Recommendations for refolding conditions for each protein will be provided.  Interim monthly updates will be provided with the monthly invoice for the work completed during that month. The government will provide to the contractor protein (Pfs48 and Pvs48).  Written results will be reported to the government within four months from the delivery date of the protein.  Government-designated personnel will address any problems noted directly to the contractor.  Testing is to start mid April 2003 and continue through mid August 2003.  The procedures that will be used in awarding this contract will be by written quotations or solicitations. The anticipated award date is March 28, 2003.  This is a noncompetitive contract action set-aside for a small business.  BaroFold, Inc. is exclusively licensed for this service.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request For Information of techniques and concepts for applicability in supporting the Ballistic Missile Defense Decision Architecture (BMD-DA).
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-HQ0006-03-12
<RESPDATE>041803

<CONTACT>Joy Smith, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-695-9209, Fax 703-697-7907, Email joy.smith@mda.osd.mil - Richard Baumgartner, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 695-9086, Fax (703) 697-7907, Email richard.baumgartner@mda.osd.mil
<DESC>This is a Request for Information (RFI).  The Missile Defense Agency (MDA), in support of the Department of Defense (DoD), seeks practical, yet innovative methods for solving difficult, real-time resource allocation and scheduling problems in uncertain, partially-observable environments.  MDA desires to interact with academia and industry to review cutting-edge techniques and explore new solution concepts—potentially across domains beyond missile defense—with significant promise for applicability in supporting the Ballistic Missile Defense Decision Architecture (BMD-DA).

The objective of the BMD-DA is to identify, within the pressing, real-time constraints of a ballistic missile engagement, a sensor and weapon allocation policy that will be effective in defeating the threat.  During such an engagement, this system must determine when, and in what mode, various sensors will be employed to estimate the position and projected movement of a given target complex – comprised of re-entry vehicles, decoys, debris, etc. – as well as the classification of its individual components.  This information, in turn, must be used to determine the most effective assignments for a limited number of weapons which may be used to destroy incoming targets.  Due to the complexity and high number of interacting factors in this system, determining the optimal allocation of sensor and weapon resources in real-time has proved to be challenging.  

DoD is currently working to deploy an initial missile defense capability in 2004, with an increasingly robust system to be implemented in subsequent years.  Initial testing of the BMD-DA is scheduled to begin in 2004 with initial deployment beginning in 2006.

To address the challenge of developing a practical BMD-DA, MDA desires to review promising mathematical and computing techniques with potential applicability to the problem domain.  Research areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following: (1) Markov Decision Processes (particularly partially-observable MDPs); (2) Bayesian networks (BN), decision networks & other computational models for probabilistic inference and decision making; (3) approximate stochastic dynamic programming; (4) expert systems and other artificial intelligence methods; (5) neural networks & other adaptive techniques; (6) planning and scheduling approaches; (7) game-theoretic approaches; (8) stochastic optimization; (9) parallel computing algorithms, and other methods for improved computational efficiency; and (10) methods to evaluate the quality of a given resource allocation policy when the global optimum is unavailable.

Given the limited time available before deployment of the BMD-DA, proposed approaches should emphasize run-time efficiency and scalability to realistic problem scales.  MDA is particularly interested in solutions with potential to transition to the BMD-DA over the next decade.  It is strongly preferred that proposed solutions rely only on technology expected to be available over that time horizon.


MDA will review responses to this RFI to determine compatibility with the goals stated above, and intends to invite authors of selected responses to a conference scheduled for the week of May 12, 2003 to review future research directions for advanced algorithms supporting Command & Control, Battle Management, & Communications (C2BMC) in national missile defense.  The conference will be based on a working panel format in which authors will brief their ideas and field questions and comments from a review panel.  The outcome of the conference will be the generation of a roadmap for model and algorithm development that will support the deployment of an effective missile defense decision architecture over the next decade.


The government invites interested parties to submit presentation abstracts and candidate solution methods.  Abstracts should be 1-2 pages in length, and provide the following information: (1) title; (2) author & contact information; (3) abstract to include the following: summary of the solution concept; discussion of why this approach appears to be promising; suggested success criteria; representative performance results, if available; and anticipated applicability to missile defense weapon & sensor allocation; (4) recent work performed relevant to the abstract; (5) organization(s) for which the work was performed; and (6) references and papers supporting the abstract.

Any anticipated limits, constraints, or costs related to testing or distributing required software should be clearly stated, as well as any proprietary & non-disclosure requirements. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any proprietary information not properly identified.  Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with applicable Government regulations.  

Authors should send responses electronically (in Word or PDF format) to Ms. Joy Smith (Joy.Smith@bmdo.osd.mil, telephone 703-695-9209) at MDA/CTI no later than 04/18/2003. 

This is a request for information (RFI) and no contract will be awarded pursuant to this announcement.  This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the government will issue a procurement.  The government does not intend to otherwise pay for information received in response to the RFI.

<DESC>NOTE: This procurement is open ONLY to LAW FIRMS or SOLO practitioners of LAW licensed to practice law in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  As a result of P.L. 104-134, which amended the Federal Debt Recovery Act, the Department of Justice intends to award contracts to private practitioners of law for debt collection services on behalf of the United States in the following federal judicial district:  Middle District of Pennsylvania (Harrisburg).  The contractors will be required to pursue debt collection activities which parallel existing industry procedures that have proven to be effective and efficient; to interact with government representatives at defined stages of the collection process (i.e., settlement, compromise, etc.); to input relevant case data in a computer base maintained by the government.  Payment will be made by a combination of contingency fees and firm, fixed prices.  Law firms or solo practitioners who respond to this solicitation MUST be regularly engaged in the private practice of LAW within the Middle Federal Judicial District of Pennsylvania.  "Regularly engaged in the private practice of law" is construed to mean that at least 20% of the debt collection cases handled by the offeror arise in the  Middle Federal Judicial District of Pennsylvania.  NOTE: The Act provides that the Department may contract ONLY with law firms or solo practitioners of law since contractors must represent the United States in court.  The government anticipates awarding up to four contracts (or more or less at the discretion of the government).  The period of performance for each contract will be one base year plus up to six optional years.  
The solicitation will be available about April 4, 2003 and will be distributed solely through the General Service Administration's Electronic Posting System - FedBizOpps.  The website is www.fedbizopps.gov (hard copies of the solicitation will not be available).  FedBizOpps provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will be distributed solely through FedBizOpps.  Interested parties are responsible to monitor this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.

<DESC>NAVAIR Orlando Training Systems Division intends to award a sole source modification to Outstart, Inc., located at 89 South Street, 8th Floor Lincoln Plaza, Boston, MA 01760, to the existing NILARS commercial IQC N61339-02-D-0006.  The purpose of this modification is to provide the possibility to order up to one thousand additional days of technical support services as well as travel in a not to exceed amount, in support of the Outstart Evolution Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS) on the existing NILARS commercial IQC.  This technical support is required to meet the needs of the Evolution LCMS roll out to six sites, which support twelve learning centers purchased on an existing delivery order.  The technical support shall consist of refining the integration of the OutStart Evolution LCMS software with the existing Integrated Learning Environment (ILE) systems including the Learning Management System (LMS), integration of Navy’s Reusable Learning Object Development Tool into the Evolution LCMS, and the evaluation of existing Navy content to determine integration viability into the Evolution LCMS.  It shall also include development of interfaces for existing and future Navy content and simulations, and authoring and deployment via the Evolution LCMS repository.  The technical support shall also provide for any required Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and work with Navy Knowledge OnLine vendor to enable single sign-on capability.  It shall also consist of making minor Evolution LCMS software modifications and modifying user configuration as necessary.  An award through competitive procedures to a source other than OutStart would cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency’s requirements.  The software coding and customization required for a third party to integrate another product, and the time required for a third party to become sufficiently proficient to provide support for the lifecycle of the product would pose unacceptable schedule and performance risk to the project.  OutStart Incorporated is the sole proprietary owner of the Evolution LCMS software and as such, has produced and owns the programming code necessary to modify and customize the software for the successful integration of the OutStart Evolution LCMS software at all six sites involved in the roll out. The addition of the technical support and the travel shall increase the contract ceiling by the amount of  $1,800,000.  This is not a request for quotation, nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.  This contract modification will be negotiated on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  NAWCTSD intends to award a sole source contract modification fifteen (15) business days after publication of this notice.  Questions regarding the requisite technical capabilities required to perform the services for this sole source modification may be directed in writing to the Contract Specialist, Kate Holcomb, e-mail address: katherine.holcomb@navy.mil or NAWCTSD, 12350 Research Parkway, Attn: Kate Holcomb Code 25333, Orlando, FL 32826.

<DESC>Definitional Mission for Multi-Sector Projects Kosovo

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) wishes to announce an opportunity for small business to bid on a Competitive Total Set-Aside to conduct a Definitional Mission (DM) for Multi-Sector projects.

The Contractor would have three goals: 1) to survey the Kosovo economy, focusing on the aviation, telecommunications and roads sectors, with the goal of identifying potential USTDA investments; 2) to perform standard due diligence on any projects identified; and 3) to prepare a profile of Kosovo for the Europe region, which highlights sectors and projects to be watched for their future potential as USTDA investments.  This will include projects in the environmental, wastewater, mining, and manufacturing sectors.

The Contractor will be required to have experts in the aviation and telecommunications sectors, as well as a generalist capable of looking at projects in a variety of sectors.  They would be asked to focus on the development of Terms of Reference (TOR) for projects in Kosovo, propose budgets, explore options for financing the projects, evaluate the potential for U.S. exports, examine any potential environmental impacts, and analyze the possible impact on U.S. labor.  The Contractor is required to have a road project consultant capable of reviewing the Durres–Morine road project; however, the road project consultant will not be required to travel.

It will be critical that the Contractor meet with Kosovo Government officials, UNMIK and representatives from all of the major financial institutions active in Kosovo.

In addition to identifying these and other potential USTDA projects, the Contractor will also be required to provide an overview of the Kosovo investment climate as it relates to USTDA’s future interest in the province.  It should include projects in the environmental, wastewater, mining and manufacturing sectors that USTDA should monitor for their future potential.   The team should also propose any additional DMs that should be sent to Kosovo.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

WR-ALC has and will provide drawings.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with full and open competition.  However, this acquisition will be processed in accordance with AFMC FAR Sup 5252.217-9018 (Mission Essential Quantity):  If a proven source is not the low offeror, the basic quantity may be split into a First Article quantity, for award to the low unproven offeror, and a Minimum Essential Quantity, for award to the proven source, with the balance of the requirement established as options in both contracts.  Authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), ?Supplies (or services) required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements? may apply.  Numbered Note 22 applies only to the quantity identified as the Mission Essential Quantity in the solicitation.  Estimated MEQ is 9, First Article and Production Quantity will be 6 and one out-year option will have quantity ranges from 4-7, 8-15 and 16-23.

Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.

<DESC>The USDA, Natural Resources Conservation Service is planning a Direct Conversion with Cost Comparison Study of Soil Mapping Services in St. Louis County, Minnesota. The final products of these services are completed and field correlated soil surveys for a designated geographical area determined in the solicitation that will meet National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) standards and preparing soil survey maps that will meet Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) standards. Major components of this work include: researching existing information pertaining to the survey area (i.e. existing soil surveys, topographic and geologic maps, and aerial photographs); conducting soil mapping activities utilizing the Major Land Resource Area (MLRA) concept; collecting transects and analyzing field data; identifying soil types and soil series that will meet or exceed National Cooperative Soil Survey standards; preparing samples of the soil profile and descriptions from the surface to a depth of 80 inches or point of refusal; classifying soils by soil taxonomy and assigning a series name; initiating and proposing new official series descriptions; developing data map units and maintaining the official map unit legend; compiling official field notes, soil profile sheets, field transect sheets, and mapping field sheets by map unit; entering all documentation into the National Soils Information System (NASIS); and preparing soil survey maps that will meet SSURGO standards.  Offerors must have a comprehensive understanding of NCSS standards and soil surveying principles including use of appropriate field equipment and be able to interpret aerial photography and geomorphology/landscape analysis. Offerors must have necessary skills in computer word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and Geographic Information Systems in order to produce the soil survey products required. The services provided include the ability to communicate orally and in writing to explain soil geomorphology, soil properties, and soil classification and interpretation in order to complete work according to USDA, NRCS NCSS standards. Must be able to collect, organize, and interpret data in order to provide soils information to USDA, NRCS staff, conservation district staff, and other partner agencies.  These services are currently provided by Government personnel. This it not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>This is a modification to combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161. 
The combined synopsis/solicitation number RS-ADM-03-161 is amended as set forth below.  NOTE: THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY AMENDMENT TO THE COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.  A WRITTEN AMENDMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. The hour and date specified for receipt of responses remains 3/28/03 at 3:00 p.m. local time.  Offers must acknowledge receipt of this amendment on each copy of the offer submitted or by separate letter or telegram which includes a reference to the combined sysnopsis/solicitation number and the amendment number 3.  The above numbered combined synopsis/solicitation is amended to respond to vendor questions.  Accordingly, ADM-03-161 is amended as follows:

(1)  Following are responses to questions: 


QUESTION #1 = 	How many viewers are expected for each webcast? 
RESPONSE #1 = 	100 concurrent viewers.

QUESTION #2 = 	What are the required encoding rates?
RESPONSE #2 = 	The SOW states "Enable all webcasts to be viewed at 150Kbps, 56Kbps and 28.8 Kbps".

QUESTION #3 = 	What formats for the video stream are required?
RESPONSE #3 = 	This is a vendor business decision. However, the SOW states "Provide all webcast viewers with "free" (no cost to the viewer) software for download to their computer, which enables them to monitor the NRC meetings being webcast.  The viewing software shall provide the viewer with an equivalent quality of video image and sound as the "RealNetworks" software currently used for the NRC's webcasting program.   The Contractor shall ensure that all required licensing arrangements are completed in order to make the equivalent software available for free download by NRC webcast viewers from the contractor's webcast website.

QUESTION #4 = 	Does this include videography or will we take an audio and video 
feed from NRC equipment?
RESPONSE #4 =	No. NRC will perform all videography, creation of the closed-captioning for the "live" webcasts, and combine the video/audio and closed captioning into a single Composite Video Feed.  NRC will deliver the Composite Video Feed to the NRC building P1-11 telephone room during each "test" or "Live" webcast. The vendor shall be responsible for providing a dedicated telecommunications line to get the webcast signal from the NRC's P1-11 telephone room to the vendor's webcasting system. See the RESPONSE to Question #15.
 
QUESTION #5 =	Will the presentations include Powerpoint slides and graphics? 
RESPONSE #5 =	Yes, the presentations will include powerpoint slides and graphics.

QUESTION #6 =	Do the presentations require compliance with rule 508? 
RESPONSE #6 =	Yes, the presentations require compliance with rule 508.

QUESTION #7 =	What are the existing Internet, satellite and fiber connectivity 
infrastructure capabilities?
RESPONSE #7 =	Bidders should propose a solution that provides a dedicated line between the NRC Audio-Visual equipment output point (NRC building P1-11 telephone room) and the Bidder's webcasting facility.  Do not plan on using existing NRC Internet, satellite or fiber connectivity.

QUESTION #8 =	If we have access to an internet broadband connection, what is 
the minimum "dedicated" bandwidth that would be available?
RESPONSE #8 =	This is not an option.  Bidders should propose a dedicated line.

QUESTION #9 =	Do you require video webcasts or audio only?
RESPONSE #9 =	We require video webcasts.

QUESTION #10 =	Is any lighting or audio equipment required for the bid?
RESPONSE #10 =	Refer to the RESPONSE for Question #4.  No lighting or audio equipment is required for the bid.

QUESTION #11 =	How many hours of content are expected for meetings or events 
that are NOT live webcast, but that need to be converted from video tape 
to internet library?
RESPONSE #11 =	Initially, to establish the list of archived previous webcasts on the new webcast provider's webpage, NRC will provide the new webcast provider with approximatDCAST -SUPPORT for each LIVE broadcast (streaming audio/video) over the Internet for each full half-hour of each broadcast including any pre-meeting testing: QTY - 320, UNIT - 1/2 hour, Unit Price $____, Total Price $___;

QUESTION #12 =	Is chat (for questions from audience) and polling required for the live webcast?
RESPONSE #12 =	Chat is not required.  The NRC does require the new webcast webpage to enable the viewers to complete and submit the NRC's multiple-choice "viewer survey" and also enable viewers to submit an e-mail with their comments and/or questions.  Refer to the section in the SOW for developing and hosting the webpage. 

QUESTION #13 =	Is there a dedicated TV-1 Fiber connection on site and available 
for this project at the meeting facility?
RESPONSE #13 =	No.  There is not a dedicated TV-1 Fiber connection on site and available for this project.

QUESTION #14 =	Will the incumbent vendor be bidding on this contract?
RESPONSE #14 =	No.  The incumbent vendor is another federal agency (National Institutes of Health - NIH) and this procurement is being competed as a Small-Business Set-a-Side. 

QUESTION #15 =	Will the meetings be in the same room each time?
RESPONSE #15 =	Normally, yes.  However, wherever the meetings are on the NRC campus, the NRC will provide the same Composite Video Feed over a RG6 coaxial cable down to the same fixed point in the NRC facility (P1-11 telephone room) each time.   At that fixed point in the NRC facility (P1-11 telephone room), the contractor shall be provided on-site space for the minimum on-site equipment needed to connect to the coaxial cable's RF connector, encode the signal and transmit the signal to the vendor's offsite webcasting facility over the dedicated line provided by the vendor.







QUESTION #16 =	What is the reason for switching contractors?
RESPONSE #16 =	NRC is currently obtaining this webcasting support from another federal agency (National Institutes Of Health - NIH) under an Inter-Agency Agreement until a contract with a Small Business can be established. 

QUESTION #17 =	Will the A/V equipment remain on-site, or is the existing contractor removing?
RESPONSE #17 =	The existing Contractor (NIH) has no AV equipment onsite.  The AV equipment on-site at NRC is owned and operated by NRC.  Refer to the RESPONSE to Question #4.

QUESTION #18 =	May we offer an alternative solution to encoding on-site?
RESPONSE #18 =	No, propose a solution that meets the Statement of Work (SOW).

QUESTION #19 =	Is the one hour test included in the archive, and if so, why?
RESPONSE #19 =	No, the archive only includes the actual NRC meeting being webcast and not any pre-meeting testing.

QUESTION #20 =	Also, there is reference in 0007 to 160 units and in 0008 to 120 units - can you explain how you arrived at these totals?
RESPONSE #20 =	Refer to the above revised estimates and pricing breakdown shown in the above revised pricing schedule.  The initial load of up to thirty old archived webcasts (averaging 2-hours in duration) into the new webcast webpage shall be included in the cost of CLIN #0005 above for developing the Webcast Webpage. The revised calculation is as follows: Live-webcast: QTY 320 half hours (estimated live webcast -40 time 4 hours live(with tests) equal 160 annual hours times 2 equal 320 half hours); Convert into Archive meeting: QTY 156 half-hours annually (from live within 24 hours- estimated 39 meetings times 2 hours (no tests) equal 78 hours annually times 2 equal 156 half hours);Convert into Archive meeting: QTY 4 half-hours annually (from live within 4 hours- estimated 1 meeting times 2 hours (no tests) equal 2 hours annually times 2 equal 4 half hours);Convert into Archive meeting: QTY 4 half-hours annually (from VHS within 24 hours- estimated 1 meeting times 2 hours (no tests) equal 2 hours annually times 2 equal 4 half hours);Convert into Archive meeting: QTY 4 half-hours annually (from VHS within 4 hours- estimated 1 meeting times 2 hours (no tests) equal 2 hours annually times 2 equal 4 half hours);

QUESTION #21 =	In Modification 1 you ask for a minimum 100 streams at 150kbps. 
How many concurrent streams are required for 56K and 28.8? 
RESPONSE #21 =	The requirement to support up to 100 concurrent streams at 150kbps is an estimate of the maximum bandwidth the NRC expects the public to be able to pull from the webcasting facility.  At any one point in time, the webcast provider shall support at least 100 concurrent users in any combination of the specified streaming rates of 150Kbps, 56Kbps and 28.8Kbps.

QUESTION #22 =	Can you provide a list of the AV equipment on-site and is it possible for us to have an on-site inspection prior to the bid?
RESPONSE #22 =	The list of AV equipment on-site is not needed to bid on this requirement since NRC will provide and operate all on-site AV videography equipment.  The webcast provider will only need to provide the necessary equipment on-site to connect to the NRC's AV output (composite video feed) connection point (NRC building P1-11 telephone room), encode the signal content and transmit it to the vendor's off-site webcast infrastructure over the dedicated telecom line provided by the webcast vendor.  Vendor walk-through of NRC's facilities was completed on 3/13/2003.

				A) 28.8/56k modems
				B) DSL
				C) cable
				D) T1 
RESPONSE #30 =	The majority of the target audience is the general public and they view our webcasts via a mixture of all of the above.  Those webcast viewers with modems may consume the 28.8kbps and 56kbps feeds, while the 150kbps feeds are for viewers with DSL, cable, and T1 Internet service.

QUESTION #31 =	On average, how many concurrent viewers (at the same time) do you

QUESTION #33 =	Out of that figure how many users do you estimate would like to view 
the conferences online whether on-demand or live?
RESPONSE #33 =	Refer to the RESPONSE to Question #1.

QUESTION #34 =	Is a "dedicated" connection required between NRC Headquarters and the 
potential Contractor's Webcast System Center for the transmittal of the 
encoded video content or can the Internet be used as the transmission 
medium? Either way is fine, but we wanted clarification as one method is 
more costly than the other.
RESPONSE #34 =	A "dedicated" connection is required between the NRC Headquarters building in Rockville, Maryland and the potential Contractor's Webcast System Center for the transmittal of the encoded video content.

QUESTION #35 =	Additionally, can the video feed be provided as an "S-Video" or 
Composite link from your current equipment or will we need a NTSC Scan 
Converter?
RESPONSE #35 =	The NRC will provide the AV signal output for each webcast as a Composite Video Feed.

QUESTION #36 =	Does the NRC wish to have the Webcasting infrastructure built for them?  We took a look at the current Webcasts and it looks like the infrastructure has already been built but the solicitation reads as though this is something that still needs to be done.
RESPONSE #36 =	The NRC videotapes each meeting to be webcast and provides the content to the off-site webcast provider in the form of a Composite Video Feed.  The current off-site webcast provider is the NIH which provides all the required webcasting infrastructure and support for NRC webcasts from the NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland.  The new webcast vendor will provide all webcast infrastructure and support to connect to the NRC's Composite Video Feed at the NRC building's P1-11 telephone room and accomplish all other requirements of the NRC SOW.   

QUESTION #37 =	Do you know what your average monthly transfer rates have been over the past couple years?
RESPONSE #37 =	Refer to the RESPONSE for Question #21.

QUESTION #38 =	Can you give us the average size of your footprint?
RESPONSE #38 =	Refer to the RESPONSE for Question #21.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement.  This is a sources sought synopsis only.   The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classifications (HUBZone 8(a), 8(a), HUBZone, Small Disadvantage and Large Business) relative to this 541690 NAICS Code. Responses to this sources sought synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate determinations about potential sources only.  The intended contract shall provide the Government the option to extend the contract in one-year increments for a base and four option years. 

After review of the responses to this sources sought announcement a solicitation announcement may be published in the Federal Business Opportunities at a later time.  

Responses to this notice shall include company name, address, point of contact, size of business pursuant to North American Industrial Classification Code (NAICS) and must respond to the following questions: 1) Is your business a large or small business? 2) Does your firm qualify as a small or small disadvantaged business? 3) If disadvantaged specify under which disadvantaged group is your firm certified under Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act?  4) Are you considered a certified HUBZone firm? 5) Are you considered woman-owned or operated business? 6) Are you a certified Service–Disabled Veteran Owned or Veteran Owned? 

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (SAMHSA) Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) is interested in highly experienced organizations able to maintain the CSAT Services Accountability improvement System (SAIS).  

Under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the Center is responsible for monitoring program performance across all of its budgetary lines.  Recent experience with the Performance Assessment Rating Tool (PART) process as well as an evaluation of existing CSAT GPRA data strongly indicates that CSAT needs to take significant action to strengthen the availability of information on its discretionary grant portfolio so that it can be appropriately managed.  The purpose of this contract is to consolidate GPRA reporting and related activities for CSAT’s entire discretionary program under one umbrella; these are currently spread across multiple CSAT Technical Assistance and GPRA contracts.  This contract will provide GPRA coverage for all CSAT discretionary activities in the Division of Services Improvement as well as the Homeless and Co&#64979;occurring Branch in the Division of State and Community Assistance. 
While the GPRA initiative under the National Evaluation Data Services II (NEDS&#64979;II) and other contracts has provided minimal data for the reporting of results, the data currently provided is not sufficient for program and CSAT accountability.  

This contract for the Services Accountability Improvement System will provide funding to cover GPRA activities for all discretionary programs falling under the Targeted Capacity Expansion (TCE) and Best Practices program announcements, specifically for use in conducting accountability and performance assessments of these programs, making such information available to CSAT project officers for improved project oversight and CSAT management for improved staff and grantee portfolio oversight.  In addition, the contract will provide support for the delivery of training and technical assistance to grantees on the collection of GPRA data, serving as a data entry point for GPRA data collection as well as a data repository.
 The Services Accountability Improvement System will provide additional support for GPRA and CSAT accountability and management activities, separate from grantees’ programmatic funding, and will ensure a coordinated focus on GPRA, performance monitoring and accountability data, across all TCE and Best Practice programs.  It is expected that improved funding availability will lead to more, and better data on programs and potentially will contribute to standardization of key data elements across all CSAT programs.  Specifically, CSAT will have, at a minimum, the capacity to report for all CSAT programs on:  Particular populations served, numbers of people served, types and locations of particular activities supported, effectiveness across programs for particular populations, the characteristics and effectiveness across programs of activities relative to national, subpopulation and geographic area data and trends.  Better data will provide information to Division Chiefs, Branch Chiefs, Government Project Officers (GPOs) and grantees useful both for improving programs and making more informed funding decisions.

This is not a request for proposal and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  Responses to this notice shall be mailed to Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Office of Program Services, Contract Management Branch, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockwall II Building, Suite 640, Rockville, MD 20852 Attn: Matt Johnson.  Telephone and/or e-mail responses will not be accepted. Responses must be received by in writing no later than March 29, 2003 by 3:00 pm, Eastern Standard Time.  

Responses to this sources sought announcement will not be considered adequate responses to the solicitation, a request to be added to a prospective bidders/offerors list or to received a copy of the solicitation.   All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources announcement.  No solicitation is currently available.*****

<SUBJECT>99--BAA - Development of Electrical Wiring Interconnect System Test and Inspection Systems
<SOLNBR>2993
<RESPDATE>063003
<CONTACT>Rob Pappas, 609-485-6181
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-03-000R Development of Electrical Wiring Interconnect System Test and Inspection Systems 1. Background The continued safe operation of aircraft well into their expected service life depends on the safe and effective transfer of power and electrical signals throughout the aircraft electrical wiring interconnect system (EWIS). This in turn requires the verification of the EWIS physical and functional integrity. In the event that the EWIS is treated as an indefinite life item, formal periodic inspections will be necessary to ensure its continued safe operation. Whether the EWIS is eventually subject to a fixed service life, condition based monitoring, or other life management program, there will still be a need for periodic inspection to: 1) ensure the absence of accidental damage; 2) verify service life estimates; and, 3) confirm the adequacy of maintenance and repair activities on, around, and involving the EWIS. 2. Purpose The purpose of this BAA is to support development of testing and inspection systems, technology, and techniques that identify or characterize the material or structural flaws which may impair the safe and effective transmission of electrical power and signals. The proposed systems, technology, and techniques shall exhibit potential utility for either infrequent comprehensive examinations or frequent focused inspections in an airline maintenance environment. Non-destructive inspection technologies are required to: -   Ensure the absence of accidental damage and/or EWIS degradation due to aging and operations. -   Verify service life estimates. -   Confirm the adequacy of maintenance and repair activities on, around, and involving the EWIS. -   Locate and characterize EWIS damage due to aging and operation. -   Locate and characterize precursors to EWIS failure due to aging and operation. -   Determine location of arc faults when troubleshooting an arc fault condition. 3. Submission Deadlines Technical summary proposals (see section 4) prepared in accordance with this synopsis will be accepted through 30 June 2003 or until fiscal year 2003 funding for this effort is committed, whichever occurs first. Upon request of the FAA, formal technical proposals shall be submitted not more than thirty days after the date of the request. This request will be made via email and letter. 4. Submission Requirements Offerors will submit two-page technical summaries prior to submitting a formal proposal. The two page technical summary shall meet the requirements described below. Mail the two page technical summaries to:   William J. Hughes Technical Center   Code AAR-480 (Attn: R. Pappas)   Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405 In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the summary proposal will be emailed to rob.pappas@faa.gov. The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format. Thirty days after receipt of the two-page technical summaries, the FAA will respond to offerors in one of three ways:   a.   Request for the submission a formal technical proposal.   b.   Recommendation to submit a formal technical proposal if certain changes are made or conditions met.   c.   Rejection of the summary proposal. If requested, the offeror shall submit a formal technical proposal, containing a detailed discussion of the item presented in the two-page technical summary. The formal technical proposal shall address the requirements described in the "Formal Proposal Requirements" section of this announcement. The formal technical proposal will be mailed to the FAA at the same address as the summary proposal. An electronic copy must also be provided. 5. Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements There is no specific format for the two page technical summary. The summary may be preceded by a cover letter, but the cover letter will not be considered in the evaluation, nor will pages in excess of two. At a minimum the summary shall contain the following items:   a.   The specific purpose of the system, technology, or technique.   b.   Description of the system, technology, or technique.   c.   Description of the class of applications for which the device is useful.   d.   Description of how the device will be useful to the aviation community.   e.   Information regarding interest or endorsements of aviation concerns.   f.   Current state of development of the system, technology, or technique.   g.   Estimated time for development, test, and validation, of a commercial prototype.   h.   Estimated funds required for the proposed effort, including in-house funds. 6. Formal Proposal Requirements    a.   Offerors shall specify the development of a device with performance and cost specifications matching the requirements of some application or class of applications of interest to some segment of the aviation community. The device may measure:      1.   Physical properties of the EWIS (elastic modulus, hardness, etc.);      2.   Material and structural anomalies (cuts, abrasions, chemical properties, etc.);      3.   Local electrical properties of the EWIS (dielectric constants, resistance, etc.);      4.   Bulk electrical properties of the EWIS (resistance, impedance, capacitance, isolation, AC&DC voltage drop, polarization ratio, dissipation factor, etc.); or,     5.   Any other relevant EWIS properties (thermal excursions under load, electromagnetic fields, etc.).   b.   Offerors will identify a partner within the aviation community (i.e. an airframer or aircraft operator) who will serve as an advisor and advocate for the effort. Proof of commitment by the partner will be provided with the proposal (The proof need not be a contract). Matching funds or services-in-kind from the partner are not required but will be considered positively during proposal evaluation.   c.   If the proposal includes means for test and inspection of aircraft wiring, offerors will select Polyimide, and one or more wire types from the list below that are inspectable by the proposed device. These selections will be used to independently validate the performance of the device.      1.   PVC/Glass/Nylon (MIL-W-5086, QUAD 4, etc.).     2.   Cross Linked ETFE (MIL-W-22759, Tefzel, Spec 55, etc).     3.   Poly-X (alkane-imide).     4.   Composite construction involving Polyimide or Teflon (TKT, etc).   d.   Using empirical evidence and sound logic, offerors will present a persuasive argument that the properties, states, and/or conditions (aging and non-aging conditions) measured by the device correlate with EWIS failure modes that threaten the safety of the aircraft. The offerers proposal shall contain specific and detailed performance specifications for the proposed system.   e.   Offerors shall propose to build a prototype device with the specifications identified above. For the purposes of preparing the proposal and cost estimate, the prototype shall become the property of the FAA at the conclusion of the program.   f.   Offerors shall propose to the FAA a validation plan, which includes double blind testing. Validation will be performed on the Standard Wiring Testbed located at Sandia National Labs, Albuquerque, NM. Contact Mr. Mike Dinallo, 505-844-0796, for more information on the testbed. If the testbed is not suitable to the validation of the proposed technology, please address the rational for this conclusion and an alternative means for validation. The proposal will address all costs related to the validation effort. Use of the Standard Wiring Testbed is free of charge.   g.   Offerors shall prepare an implementation and technology transfer plan, describing how the proposed technology will developed into commercial products practical for use in the inspection and maintenance of older aircraft.    h.   The proposal shall identify all areas risk related to development, implementation, and technology transfer, of the proposed system, technology, or technique. The proposal shall include mitigating strategies for each risk area. Proposals that do not identify risk areas will be considered non-developmental in nature and therefore outside the scope of this research program. Implementation risks are associated with logistical issues, missing/inadequate support infrastructure, etc.   i.   Offerors shall include in their proposals a detailed cost proposal. In-house funding, cost matching, services-in-kind, will be identified in the cost proposal as necessary. All manpower related to double blind testing and validation shall also be provided. The cost of the delivered prototype shall be identified separately. 7. Method of Evaluation  Proposals will be evaluated in the seven technical areas listed in order of decreasing importance:   a.   Technical merit.   b.   Utility to the aviation community.   c.   Investigative team competency and experience.   d.   Logical and effective validation strategy.   e.   Technical risks and implementation risks, and the mitigation plan for each.   f.   Availability and quality of equipment and facilities.   g.   Effective project management plan. Cost and cost realism will be evaluated as acceptable or unacceptable only. Acceptable proposals will have costs commensurate with the work load proposed and will not be in excess of $400,000 in any fiscal year. 8. Period of Performance:  Efforts lasting between one and four years will be considered. Multiyear efforts will be funded in yearly increments, providing measurable and adequate performance is shown prior to each new funding increment.

The Army will not transfer ownership of land or any land lease interest for Soldier System Center, Natick, and will grant easements and leases, with concurrence of the underlying leaseholder where applicable, for access to land associated with each utility system.

OBJECTIVE:  Should privatization occur, the ownership of the entire electrical distribution system and equipment to include, all capital investments, operation, maintenance and repair responsibilities, shall transfer to a publicly or privately owned utility provider.  All responsibility for maintaining reliable service, including such items as environmental compliance, operation, maintenance, major systems renovation, construction, equipment, manpower and overhead shall be the responsibility of the new owner.  Utility services under the potential contract will not include electrical supply.  Therefore the owner of the distribution network and equipment need not also generate or resell electric power to Soldier System Center, Natick.  

INSTALLATION AND UTILITY SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

Note:	(1).  All technical data and information listed below is to be considered either an estimated quantity or an approximate order of magnitude.  This data was developed using data provided by the Soldier System Center, Directorate of Installation Services and DESC is not responsible for the accuracy of the information at each site-specific installation.

b.	Substations and Switching Stations:
–	One 13.8 kV distribution substation (Station 328).  

c.	Transformers:  There are 27 pad-type transformers located within the facility.


PROCESS:  This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the privatization of the electrical distribution system at Soldier System Center, Natick.  In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determining marketing strategies for privatizing the utility systems.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming.   Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.  The statement of interest must not exceed a total length of 15 pages. The statement shall include as a minimum, the following information:  (1) capability and experience in the ownership, operation and maintenance of similar systems; (2) financial capability to purchase, upgrade, expand, operate and maintain utility systems; (3) conceptual rate plan (i.e., will charges for utility service be made from existing rates or from rates developed specifically for service at the individual installation(s); (4) discussion of your conceptual basis for a proposed purchase price (capitalized earnings value, replacement cost new less depreciation, original cost less depreciation, or other); (5) understanding of the federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and familiarity and experience with environmental compliance procedures and regulations for the state of Massachusetts and US Environmental Protection Agency Regions; (6) Company point of contact and e-mail address.

SITE VISIT AND DATA:  Neither a site visit nor the provision of additional data on the utility systems is considered necessary for the preparation and submittal of statement of interest.  If a site visit and the provision of additional data are later determined necessary, notification will be provided by way of an amendment to this announcement.  

DUE DATE:  Statements of interest must be submitted to Defense Energy Support Center (DESC-EA) by March 31, 2003 by 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Operation of the 
National Alternative Fuels and Clean Cities Hotline.

Under the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and a number of Executive Orders, the federal government has demonstrated its resolve to promote the use of alternative fuels (ethanol, methanol, natural gas, propane, electric, hydrogen, biodiesel, and P-Series) and alternative fuel vehicles, both to promote the goals of reaching energy independence and security and to clean up the environment.  These legislative acts and executive orders outline the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) commitment to alternative fuels and its requirement to provide information about alternative fuels through outreach and education.  In tandem with the influence that such legislation has had on the stimulation of the alternative fuels industry is the need to support this legislation and generated public interest by providing an instrument for information dissemination. 

Under the work being sought, the focal point must provide a real-time resource that people may call or contact electronically to have questions answered on all aspects of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has been designated Program Manager by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to implement various parts of AMFA (1988) and the National Energy Policy Act (1992).  At the direction of DOE, the alternative fuels 'hotline' function falls under the responsibility of NREL.

NREL is seeking organizations that have the capability to operate, under NREL management, an Alternative Fuels and Clean Cities Hotline.  The basic Hotline operational tasks are to:
·Gather information and maintain knowledge of alternative fuels and advanced technology vehicles through reading, Web searches, industry contacts, etc.
·Respond to all queries that come to the Hotline via phone calls, emails, mail, or faxes.

The organization shall be able to provide knowledgeable Hotline operators/experts in the field of alternative fuels, where the representation of fuel neutrality is absolute.  The operators must be capable of answering questions from callers and electronic mail using:
 
1.Expertise gained by having worked in the alternative fuel field; 
2.Monitoring of industry information and development;
3.Searches of Web-based alternative fuels and related information;
4.Searches of various databases, such as information in NREL's Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC) and its database of alternative fuel documents, laws and incentives affecting alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs); and 
5.Referrals to known experts in the alternative fuel field.  

Requests are processed in a real-time environment through Internet access, searching the NREL request management database in order to determine whether or not a caller/email requester is a previous requester to the system, and to verify/update information stored on his/her behalf. The organization will be responsible for accurately entering requests for information, including the verification/addition of requester profile information, into the Web-based request handling system. The information is then distributed at NREL through its automated processing and distribution system.

Possible related tasks for this project may include:
1.Reviewing alternative fuel Web sites so that DOE’s Clean Cities and AFDC sites can be as up to date as possible, both for internal content, and pointers to related databases; 
2.Maintaining information contained in the Consumer Buyer’s Guide laws and incentives database;
3.Providing selected communication and outreach tasks to raise awareness of DOE’s Hotline and other related activities.  

Demonstration of listed skills related to these areas is requested from interested sources. 

Organizations responding to this Sources Sought request must demonstrate its specific capabilities, attributes, and skills, as indicated below:
1.The organization will demonstrate an historical involvement in, and extensive knowledge of, the alternative fuels industry.  
2.The organization will describe their alternative fuels expertise, industry associations and contacts in the AFV arena and/or experience with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Clean Cities Program within their company. 
3.The organization will show that it has significant contacts and resources in alternative fuels areas by demonstrating its involvement in conferences and events as panelists, speakers, or exhibitors, including related publications. The organization will provide a list of publications in the alternative fuels area for which it can claim authorship.

6.The organization shall demonstrate its experience in the use of client-provided Web forms, including data entry and updating projects in which they have been involved. The organization shall also demonstrate its capability to reduce tabular information to summary data for the generation of reports.  The organization shall provide examples of skills and tools it possesses to meet these needs.

The response to this sources sought document is limited to 10–15 pages of single spaced text of 12-point Arial font or equivalent, with minimum 1” margins all around. Brevity is encouraged.
 
Any organizations interested in working with NREL to operate a national alternative fuels and Clean Cities hotline and potential associated activities should mail a list of qualifications or business profile to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, ATTN:  Mia Mascitelli, 1617 Cole Boulevard - MS 1632, Golden, CO 80401-3393.

<DESC>OVERVIEW

Dr. John Garrick has been an Advisor Committee on Nuclear Waste (ACNW) Member since 1994.  As such, he has the official employment status of “Special Government Employee” (SGE).  His main role as a member of the ACNW is to provide technical advice on key nuclear waste issues directly to the Commission.  Dr. Garrick was selected and reappointed as an ACNW Member by the Commission based on his past and current professional experience dealing with important issues in the nuclear waste area.  

Throughout Dr. Garrick’s tenure with the ACNW (over six years) he has required the services of an Administrative Assistant for approximately eight hours per week.  Because Dr. Garrick is a SGE and he provides advice directly to the Commission, his requirements for administrative help are unique and require an individual with an extensive knowledge of the NRC’s travel system, compensation reporting system for “Special Government Employees”, contracting system, bankcard system, the document control system, and the electronic library system.  

First, as a SGE selected by the Commission and based out of St. George, Utah, Dr. Garrick, is required to travel frequently from Utah to Rockville, Maryland; San Antonio, Texas; and Los Vegas, Nevada in order to fulfill his responsibilities to the Commission.  This “off-site” frequent travel situation is unique and requires administrative support with extensive knowledge of the Federal Travel Regulations and access to the NRC system for travel authorizations, vouchers and accommodations.    

In addition, Dr. Garrick’s status as a SGE requires that a tracking system which monitors the days he works on ACNW activities does not exceed the calendar year limit set by law. This is a requirement unique to his status as a SGE and requires a level of knowledge to distinguish ACNW work from other business conducted by Dr. Garrick .  Further,  the administrative requirements for the compensation of Dr. Garrick is, likewise a complicated matter.  It requires that compensation hours be broken out by the ACNW office budget arenas and then again by the specific activity for which compensation is being sought.  Again, the administrative support person must be intimately familiar with the NRC labor codes and their relationship to the  budget arenas such as the relationship of Yucca Mountain to the High Level Waste budget arena. The travel regulations, the compensation regulations and the SGE requirements are activities which may be audited and therefore require the extensive knowledge to ensure they are properly documented.  
 
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT REQUIREMENTS

It is with the aforementioned in mind that the ACNW office specifies the following as requirements for Dr. Garrick’s administrative services:

1.  Labor hours per week shall be between 5-8 and for consistency purposes, shall be provided by the same individual on a flexible basis depending on Dr. Garricks ACNW  business activities during a particular week. 

2.  Demonstrated working knowledge of the government rules and regulations (See http://policyworks.gov/org/main/mt/homepage/mtt/ftr/ftrhp.shtml) for the purpose of submitting Dr. Garrick’s Compensation Report--contains the following   information: Date, Nature of Work, and Total Hours-- and Travel Worksheet-- contains the following information: Travel Dates, Location (From/To), Airline & Flight #, Taxi/Limo, Lodging, and Misc.-- to the NRC Project Officer (PO).  A template of the Compensation Report and Travel Worksheet will be provided by the PO.

3.  Demonstrated working knowledge of the government rules and regulations for the purpose of maintaining records that are subject to audit by the Office of Inspector General.  Such records include: time and labor, bankcard expenditures, and travel reimbursement records.

4.  Demonstrated working knowledge in Wordperfect, Powerpoint, Excel, and Groupwise for the purpose of preparing high level correspondence, high level presentation material, maintaining an integrated calendar, and downloading e-mails, ADAMS documents (See http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/adams.html), etc.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

All technical factors are equal and when combined are more important than price in determining the best value to the Government.

The following factors will be used to evaluate offers:

EXPERIENCE:
Extent to which the offeror demonstrates experience in providing the administrative services requirements.  Offerors are requested to provide a summary of completed or current efforts/projects that are similar or same as those required by the NRC.  Such experience should date back no more than two years.  Recency and depth of experience will be evaluated.

PAST PERFORMANCE:
Extent to which the offeror assesses and/or demonstrates successful performance on past contracts for similar work to that stated under the Administrative Assistants Requirements 1-4 above.  Offerors are requested to provide the names, phone numbers, a technical as well as contractual contact for each of the efforts provided under experience above.

PRICE PROPOSAL:

<DESC>Statement of Needs:

Overview:

This is a total small business set-aside.  For this procurement a company is considered small if it has gross average annual sales for the proceeding three years of less than $6.0 million.  All responsible small businesses may submit an offer that will be considered.  The NAICS code for this action is 541430, Graphic Design Services, Size Standard $6.0 Million.  The Office of Personnel Management requires the services of a commercial vendor to provide design (consistent with OPM’s established corporate image) for a wide range of products (i.e.: posters, charts, banners, flyers, pamphlets, books, etc…).  The vendor must be available/reachable 24/7.  Some orders may also require production of banners for indoor/outdoor use (1’x 10’- 4’x25’) output and mounting of charts and posters on foam core (or equal), up to 3’x4’, conversion of printing files for use on the Internet, and miscellaneous other graphic arts services.  This procurement will lead to the award of a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with a period of performance of 1 year from the date of award.


Schedule:

Approximately 50% of the orders will be placed in the afternoon to late evening with delivery required by 8 am of the next day, 30% will require delivery within 2-3 days and the remaining 20% will be for 5 days or more.

If delivery is not made as required the order may no longer be required, and therefore the Government will render no payment.  If the product is still required only normal charges will be paid for the work performed (no surcharges).  Additionally, if the product does not match the approved proofs or furnished directions the Government reserves the right to reject the order and render no payment.

Contacts:

The vendor must provide contact names and phone numbers, as many orders will be placed late in the day or after normal business hours.

Pickup & Deliveries:
 
Contractor will pickup and deliver all materials to the Office of Personnel Management.  When possible government furnished material and deliverables will be transmitted electronically via email, to an FTP site, or as mutually agreed.

Frequency of Orders:

OPM is unable to predict with any certainty the frequency or orders, generally 1 - 4 orders will be placed each month.  Orders will be placed via telephone accompanied with a task order from the Publications Services Division.

Average number of orders per month will be 2.  Our estimate of the types of orders that will be placed is as follows:

10 invitations/cards (OPM to print orders that require printing/silk screening versus electronic production of small quantities which are to be produced on this contract) 1 color, stock furnished.

4 posters (OPM to print orders that require printing versus electronic production of small quantities which are to be produced on this contract), 2 – 4 colors, gloss finish stock, mounted on foam core, 2 – 10 copies for electronic production.

6 orders for charts/graphs, averaging 5 –10 products per order, 2 – 4 colors, matte finish stock, mounted on foam core, 3’ x 4’.

2 books, 48 – 250 pages (OPM to print), 2 – 4 colors.

6 banners, some with 2 or more products with the same or different images, 4-color process.

4 pamphlets, 4 – 16 pages (OPM to print), 2 – 4 colors.

2 orders requiring conversion of files for use on the Internet, these products will normally be the books or pamphlets produced under this contract.


Government Furnished Material:

When the Government deems it possible all materials will be furnished to the vendor electronically.  Otherwise, the vendor must pickup the GFM from the Office of Personnel Management or a mutually agreed upon location.


Samples:

When submitting your bid please provide samples of no less than 5 previous products designed by your company.


Proposal Preparation Requirements:

In submitting an offer for this project, the contractor must provide:

Technical Proposal (Original and two copies)
Resumes of key personnel
A description and samples of similar work performed in the last 24 months
Customer references including names and telephone numbers of company contacts
Timeline for completion of tasks and technical plan describing how work would be accomplished.
Minimum level of work/reimbursement needed to perform under this contract.
Price per hour for design work.
Price to produce products listed under Frequency of Orders (samples of these products are available for viewing at OPM in Room 5H35).

Vendor must address the following issues in their proposal:

Means of providing after hours service and contact information.

Evaluation:

A blanket purchase agreement will be established with the offeror OPM determines offers the best value.  Award from this solicitation will be made on a “best value” basis. In making that determination, selecting the successful offeror, the technical factors bear significantly more importance than cost, but cost could be the deciding factor if there are no essential technical differences among the most highly rated offers.


Technical Evaluation:

Technical proposals will be evaluated against the following criteria. They are listed in descending order of importance:

Experience/ education of key personnel 
Quality of past performance based on input from references
Quality and relevance of plan for accomplishing work and other relevant information
Experience in performing similar projects
Approach for handling and sanitizing mail, or alternative delivery method (photocopy or digital transmission)


Cost Evaluation:

The OPM will evaluate the estimated prices you have proposed for the jobs listed in the “Frequency of Orders” section of the request for quotations in addition to the price per hour you have proposed for design work.  For evaluation purposes, we estimate there will be 775 design hours of service.

The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions, so initial offers should be on terms most favorable to the Government. The Government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest price offeror.

Please provide your response no later than March 28, 2003, at 3:00PM, to the following address:
