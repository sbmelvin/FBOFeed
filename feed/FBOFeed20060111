<DESC>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), a bureau of the Department of Treasury, intends to issue a sole source purchase order utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures to  Zeta Services, Inc. for credit scoring services which includes 3 copies of quarterly updates. This scoring service is used by the OCC's Office of Interagency Shared National Credit (SNC) as a prescreening tool for public companies and provides an objective means of testing the effectiveness and consistency of Shared National Credit dispositions.  The Zeta score is applied to the credits in the SNC database to measure the borrower's ability to repay.  The model has been proven to be effective in identifying and precreening high quality borrowers and reducing the number of credit scores reviewed. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; a solicitation document will not be issued.  All information received after the date of this notice with pricing and sufficient technical documentation to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement will be considered by the OCC.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the OCC.  Information received will be considered primarily for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>It is the intention of the Federal Railroad Administration’s (FRA) Office of Safety to enter into a Sole Source Contract/Purchased Services Vendor agreement with John F. Sneed to record minutes for Railroad Safety Advisory Committee (RSAC) meetings. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures, FAR Part 13.
Mr. Sneed is uniquely qualified because of his expertise and knowledge of railroad safety issues discussed at the meetings, his acquaintance with the railroad management, union, industry, and Government officials who participate on the RSAC, and his good writing skills.  FRA does not require, or desire a verbatim transcript, i.e., a court reporter/stenographer rendition of RSAC meeting proceedings.  However, the recorder must be able to accurately reflect positions taken by key participants and agreements reached by the group.  The minutes must include technical details, where necessary, to understand fully the positions and agreements articulated by the group.  The minutes must filter out non-germane conversations between members, which have no bearing on the positions or agreements reached.

Mr. Sneed has a keen understanding of the complexity and sensitivity of the issues before RSAC.  Mr. Sneed’s longstanding involvement with RSAC has provided continuity to this important railroad safety process.  FRA now uses RSAC as its principal resource for developing new safety rules for the railroad industry.  FRA believes that greater compliance with rules is being achieved by rules that are jointly developed under the collaborative efforts of FRA, labor and management.
Mr. Sneed has unique expertise and the ability to successfully complete the responsibilities of this contract/purchased services vendor agreement.
In 2006, FRA now uses RSAC as its principal resource for developing new safety rules for the railroad industry.  FRA believes that greater compliance with rules is being achieved by rules that are jointly developed under the collaborative efforts of FRA, labor and management.  If progress cannot be achieved in developing new Agency rules under RSAC, FRA can remove a Task from RSAC and proceed with Agency rules under a conventional rulemaking process.  When this occurs, FRA finds that it has benefitted greatly from having heard and understood the positions of the parties during the RSAC Working Group and Task Force deliberations.

To propose a regulatory agenda item to RSAC, FRA first makes a presentation to the full RSAC and requests that the full RSAC accept a Task to propose new rules.  Once a Task is accepted by the full RSAC, it is assigned to an RSAC Working Group.  The RSAC Working Group may further divide the Task into segments, which are examined by RSAC Task Forces.  Examples of RSAC Tasks include: (1) Revision of Freight Power Brake Regulations; (2) Revision of the Track Safety Standards; (3) Railroad Communications; (4) Tourist, Excursion, Scenic and Historic Service Railroads; (5) Revision of Steam-Powered Locomotive Inspection Standards; (6) Revision of Qualification and Certification of Locomotive Engineers Regulations; (7) Safety Standards for Track Motor Vehicles Self Propelled Roadway Equipment; (8) Locomotive Crashworthiness and Working Conditions; (9) Locomotive Cab Working Conditions;
(10) Revision of Locomotive Event Recorder Requirements; (11) Positive Train Control Systems–Technologies, Definitions, and Capabilities; (12) Positive Train Control Systems–Implementation Issues; (13) Standards for New Train Control Systems; (14) Definition of Reportable “Train Accident;” (15) Railroad Operating Practices–Blue Signal Protection of Workmen; (16) Accident/Incident Reporting/Conformity; (17) Review of Passenger Safety Issues; (18) Review of Roadway Worker Protection Issues; and (19) Reduce Human Factor-Caused Train Accident/Incidents.

Scope of Work:
The full RSAC meets approximately three times a year.  RSAC Working Groups and RSAC Task Forces may meet monthly.  The Contractor/Purchased Services Vendor may be requested to attend full RSAC, RSAC Working Group, or RSAC Task Force meetings at least two times a month.  Meeting minutes must be kept of the full RSAC proceedings and are part of the RSAC Docket.  Meeting minutes must also be kept of each RSAC Working Group and RSAC Task Force meeting, to enable a review of RSAC activities by FRA, the U. S. Department of Transportation, Office of Inspector General, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office.  These are posted on the RSAC Internet Web Site.  The minutes should include:

	(1)	The time, date, location, and attendance of the meeting.

	(2)	A summary of matters discussed, by whom, and conclusions reached.

	(3) 	Identification of reports received, issued, or approved by the Committee, or various working groups of the Committee.

	(4)	A description of the extent to which the meeting was closed to the public, if authorized under 41 CFR 101-6.1023.
This award will be made on or about January 25, 2006 under the Simplified Acquisition threshold.  The NAICS code for this acquisition is 488210.  A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Oral communications are not accepted in response to this notice, reference FAR subpart 6.3.

This acquisition is 100% set-aside for eligible 8(a) firms.  8(a) firms must meet the Small Business Administrations (SBA) criterion, and have previously been certified by the SBA as an 8(a) firm, which have a NAICS Code 236220 having a size standard of $28.5 million average annual receipts for the preceding three (3) fiscal years.  Joint Ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides. The Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and all supporting documents (i.e., tax returns, financial statements, narratives, checklists etc.) must be submitted as soon as possible but no less than twenty (20) working days prior to the scheduled date for contract award.  Incomplete packages will be returned without action.  The Joint Venture Agreement must be approved by SBA prior to award of any resulting contract.  Failure to obtain SBAs approval of the JVA prior to award will result in SBAs request to the buying activity to terminate the award.  Offers from concerns other than 8(a) will not be considered.  The general description of work includes construction of a new free-standing research laboratory building.  This building is approximately 6,400 gross square feet, slab-on grade, single-story construction with a reinforced concrete foundation and masonry exterior walls with a built-up low-pitch roof.  A new equipment yard of approximately 1,650 square feet is to be constructed adjacent to the new building.  Also included is construction of a vertical circulation addition to the south end of the existing Building 6 (nearby the new building site), as well as selective renovation and building service and utility upgrades.  Building 6 contains approximately 12,500 square feet of occupiable space.  The selective renovation pertains primarily to building and fire code deficiencies.  The project includes a significant amount of underground utility work (most utilities are privately-owned) associated with the new building construction, the construction of the vertical circulation addition, and with new building services.  Asbestos abatement (flooring, pipe insulation, crawlspace earth excavation, and exterior finish) is included in the project scope.  During selective demolition, worker protection, handling and disposal of lead-based painted materials will be required.  Phases of work will be staggered to provide for completion of all work roughly around the same time and to minimize the amount of time that various sections of Building 6 will need to be vacant.  Part of Building 6 (existing labs on the north section of the first floor) will remain occupied during the work, requiring the utility work in this area to be accomplished during hours that can be accommodated by the tenants (primarily evenings and weekends).  Contract award is subject to availability of funds.  Performance period is 495 calendar days after Notice to Proceed.  Project Magnitude is between $2,000,000 and $5,000,000.  Pre-Bid Conference/Site Visit is scheduled on/about 2/15/06 at 9:00 a.m.  Offer due date is 3/1/06 by 3:00 p.m. local time.  Solicitation documents and amendments will be available for download on the VA Business Opportunitites Website or the Fed Biz Opps website.  Paper copies of the solicitation will not be issued.  Any and all question regarding this solicitation shall be in writing and sent to the Contracting Officer.  NOTE:  Solicitation is currently being reviewed by Legal and Technical and all information identified above is subject to change.

This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The ADCP is one of the integrated system components of the new PINS V5 that are presently under development and near delivery.  No other ADCP can be substituted in its place since the PINS V5 software has been written to specifically interface with this system.  If another system were to be substituted in its place it would be an enormous cost and would cause a tremendous delay in the delivery schedule.  RD Instruments is the sole manufacturer and distributor of the ADCP system.  FSC Code is 6605.  NAICS Code is 334511.  SBA Size Standard is 750 employees.

<DESC>The Program Executive Office (PEO) Simulation, Training, and Instrumentation in Orlando, FL intends to acquire 40 Wireless Live Fire Trainers (WLT), a spares package, and technical support for the WLT systems from the only known source to Government, DAS Electronics, Inc.  There is no set aside for this acquisition since there is only one known source to the Government.  The WLT marksmanship training system is to be used by individuals or small groups to practice and refine rifle-shooting skills.  The WLT shall be durable and rugged enough for heavy outdoor use.  All components necessary for operating the system shall be ruggedized for use by soldiers under weather conditions (including rain and snow) typically encountered on rifle ranges.  It shall operate normally in ambient temperatures between 20° and 110° F.  The total weight of a complete system shall not exceed 50 lb. and the components shall be packaged in carrying cases so they can be transported by a single soldier without damage.  Components in their carrying cases shall be sized to fit in the bed of a light truck for transport to and from a firing range.  The system shall be capable of being unpacked, assembled, and readied for operation in less than twenty minutes.  The system shall be capable of performing on unimproved, uneven terrain where line-of-sight exists between the firing point and the target.  The WLT shall use battery-operated wireless technology; batteries shall be re-chargeable up to 100 times.  A set of fully charged batteries shall be capable of supporting a shooting session of 4 hours without replacement.  The system display shall sequentially number the firer’s shots on the display automatically and provide sight correction recommendations after each fired shot.  All shots that pass through the target space with supersonic velocity shall be detected and displayed with location coordinates on the monitor; the location reported on the monitor shall be within 10mm of the actual strike on the target.  The system shall be able to record all shots fired at rates up to 2 per second.  The system shall allow the user to conveniently save scores and other data from shooting sessions.  It shall be possible to refresh and clear shots from the display screen for a new shooting session. The screen shall be able to display a minimum of 100 shots per shooting session.  The system shall be capable of transferring stored data to standard printers for printing and customized reports.  The system shall accommodate all standard NATO 5.56mm and 7.62mm ammunition at distances where the projectile is traveling at supersonic velocity.  The system shall be capable of providing performance analysis data; this includes documenting individual name, rifle serial number, dates, shooting position, air temperature, weather conditions, wind speed and direction, light, ammo lot, site location, and shooting distances.  Multiple systems shall be capable of operating without interference (either RF or acoustic) in proximity to each other.  For this purpose, a separation distance of no more than 40 meters between adjacent systems shall be necessary to preclude interference.  The RF system shall comply with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirements and shall not interfere with other communications devices/systems.  The system shall be usable with standard Army E and F silhouette targets, International Combat Competition Shooting targets, and commonly available commercial NRA-type paper targets.  The system shall be compliant with the 25 meter zeroing and Alternate C Record Fire Qualification requirements in the current FM 3-22.9, subject:  Rifle Marksmanship M16A1, M16A2/3, M16A4, and M4 Carbine.  The target image in use shall be displayed on the monitor with the shot locations superimposed on it as the shooter fires.  The system shall be safe for soldiers to use; its components shall create no safety hazards for users or other personnel.  The system shall create no environmental hazards.  The system shall include a users manual that describes minor maintenance/repair procedures in addition to operating instructions.

The Government will issue a Request for Quote (RFQ) on or about 25 January 2006 to DAS Electronics. The Government shall allow a 21 (twenty-one) day response time for receipt of quote from the date of issuance of the solicitation.  The purchase order is expected to be awarded on or about 17 March 2006.  The WLT systems are to be shipped to Supply Officer/ITO, 2105 9th Street, Bldg # 4189, Fort Sam Houston, TX. 78234-5000 upon award. The first article demo will be completed five months after contract award, delivery of the WLT systems one year after contract award, and the training and technical support complete 16 months after contract award.  PEO STRI seeks to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract under FAR Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  Questions regarding the subject requirement are welcome and should be emailed to Ms. Lynn Carlson, Contract Specialist at lynn.carlson1@peostri.army.mil or Ms. Jackie Reyenga, Contract Specialist at jackie.reyenga@peostri.army.mil.

In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 06 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 75.83% to SB, 15.8% to SDB, 14.23% to WOSB, 1.28% to HUBZone SB and .12% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.

<DESC>The United States Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Services has a requirement for consulting services per the Statement of Work described below:
Background
The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) first utilized database consulting services for Sybase in 1997 when the Agency implemented the Enhanced List Maintenance Operations (ELMO) database on the IBM platform under AIX.  This was the first use of relational databases in NASS and the database server was Sybase.  These services were very beneficial in helping us size and configure the database resources.  We needed expertise in both data placement and storage options to optimize the Sybase databases.  These consulting services were instrumental in setting database configuration parameters for CPU and memory utilization.  This included SQL Server configuration, device setup, memory allocation and utilization, and locking/blocking issues.  The consulting included knowledge transfer to help the administrators and developers gain an understanding of the ELMO application and its performance, implementation and design.  The work done then is still in place today, after nearly eight (8) years.  
Over the next couple of years NASS utilized these Sybase consulting services to evaluate backup requirements for the various processing systems and to work with developers to create scripts to automate many of the functions being developed.  This work was invaluable in setting up our production environments.
When NASS began gearing up for the 2002 Census of Agriculture, we again turned to expert advice and consulting on Sybase to assess and recommend improvements to the new processing systems being developed for that effort.  Again the consulting effectively leveraged the expertise and knowledge of our applications which allowed that consulting to significantly enhance many queries and improve the systems performance.  The service also provided explanations on how Sybase performed various operations, which provided NASS staff with valuable, applicable information.
In June 2004 our Sybase transactional consulting began to partner with our IBM analytical database consultants to develop an enterprise data model that would not only handle the 2007 Census of Agriculture, but our survey processing as well.  This work continued through the contract period in 2005, and is expected to continue for the next 5 years.  
Their institutional knowledge of NASS and the continuing work on our Enterprise Data Model is critical for this ongoing development work.  The Enterprise Data Model is a key component of our Enterprise Architecture and is needed to fulfill the Government mandate on systems development alignment with business imperatives.
Place of Performance
NASS is looking for a contractor to provide on-site consulting and mentoring services, as described below, at 1400 Independence Ave., SW, Washington, D.C. 20250.  These services will be provided for up to 240 hours not to exceed six one week long engagements during the contract year.

NASA/HQ intends to purchase products and services from TEAM ANALYSIS, Inc. of Purcellville, VA. In 2003, NASA HQ reviewed several software solutions to support the Environmental Management Division and determined that the IDEAL software solution package was the most advantageous to the Government. This software package was developed by Primetime, Inc. and Team Analysis, both of whom jointly own the rights to the IDEAL software. It is in the best interest of the Government to continue using the IDEAL software package, and therefore pursue a sole source contract for this software and maintenance.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer by 12:00 Noon on Tuesday, January 17, 2006, which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for renewal of MAXIMO software license and technical support.  NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from MRO Software as the only known source that can meet Agency requirements.  The annual software license support and upgrades items allow the users to obtain help from MRO Software whenever needed.  Also, code upgrades (facilities/equipment inventory, work reception and tracking, work control, execution and evaluation) are provided to the user periodically. If this maintenance agreement was not renewed, MRO Software's technical and maintenance support  and feature enhancements would be discontinued. Project personnel would then not have the latest software tools they need to perform their work. MRO Software is the only known source for support for continuation of maintenance support and upgrades for the Maximo Software.  Award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of costs  to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 27, 2006. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Krautkramer USN 58L and USM 35 Portable Flaw Detectors. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Jess W. Jackson, 5096 Bristol Industrial Way, Buford, GA, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for the acquisition of supplies or services determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.	Recent market research revealed that the Krautkramer has the only Digital Ultrasonic Inspection System that can satisfy the Government’s current requirements to ultrasonically detect defects in materials on the Space Shuttle External Tank Feedline Bellows accurately while using MSFC’s existing Krautkramer transducers.  There are no other known systems that have the capability to operate congruently with Krautkramer transducers and at the same time, contain the following salient characteristics essential for optimum efficiency: •	Electric Multi-Curve Distance Amplitude-Correction/Time Corrected Gain Capability •	AC and DC Operation •	Two Independent Monitoring Gates •	Positive Halfwave, Negative Halfwave, Fullwave, RF Receification •	Corrected Leg Function – Display Coded Information on Leg in Color for Angle Beam Inspection  •	Data Memory with a Minimum of 200 Instrument Set Ups 	2.	Market research reveals that the patent for the fifth salient feature above, Corrected Leg Function – Display Coded Information on Leg in Color for Angle Beam Inspection, is held only by General Electric, owner of Krautkramer.  This feature is the latest feature available that enables the user to correctly identify the proper sound beam geometry, thus, greatly reducing the possibility of operator error. Market research also revealed that Jess W. Jackson is the manufacturer’s representative (General Electric) and the only source from which the required system, with all salient features, can be procured within the seven southeastern states to include Alabama. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on January 17, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>The U.S. EPA, National Homeland Security Research Laboratory (NHSRC)/ Threat and Consequence Assessment Division (TCAD) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with John Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU APL), under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, to modify the syndromic surveillance program, Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-Based Epidemics (ESSENCE).  The Contractor shall modify source code for ESSENCE and create an additional module that will integrate water quality parameters and water utility customer complaints.  The module will be used by local jurisdictions to improve detection of waterborne disease outbreaks or intentional/accidental contamination incidents. The contractor shall:  (1) Analyze historical data from participating water utilities to determine if the data demonstrate a correlation between water quality parameters/operating conditions and public health surveillance indicators;  (2) Determine what algorithms best utilize the correlating data, and if the algorithms can be validated with artificial data;  (3) Recommend alert levels for the water utility and for the local public health epidemiologists for each proposed algorithm;  (4) Develop data transfer protocols for real-time water quality data;   (5) Develop a user screen within the ESSENCE program for use by the local water utility public health epidemiologist(s) that visually portrays the results of integrating water quality data with public health data;  (6) Develop a ?Users Guide? for water utility account holders;  (7) Develop a training class for water utility and public health representatives on the proposed new user screens and the protocols for entering water quality data into ESSENCE;  (8) Conduct a 30-day beta test of real-time data transfer and user screen interpretation; and (9) Refine water utility and public health user screens within the ESSENCE program and the real-time water quality data entry protocols as needed based on beta test evaluation. This notice is not a request for proposals.  EPA source research indicates that JHU APL is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement based on the fact that it developed ESSENCE and only JHU APL personnel have access to ESSENCE?s source code and algorithms.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA requirements may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the statement of work.  Such documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of electronic posting of this notice.     Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. A determination not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. This acquisition is being processed under FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  The applicable NAICS code is 541551.  The anticipated award date is 4/15/06.  See Numbered Note 26.

<ARCHDATE>06302006
<CONTACT>Diane Skinnell, Contract Specialist, Phone 717 770-4613, Fax 717 770-5689, Email diane.skinnell@dla.mil
<DESC>The Contractor  shall furnish all labor, tools, parts, materials, transportation and miscellaneous items necessary to conduct an engineering analysis and inspection of the  existing electrical, pneumatic, mechanical, and structural systems including runway load bearing foundations, supports, rail stops and rail tracks of a 1985 American-Clyde 75 ton portal ( whirley type) crane model 28-DE-110-15, serial number CW-4083.  The engineering analysis report shall be stamped and certified by a professional engineer in the heavy lift crane business. Report shall be three-fold: 

 First Report is a study/analysis of the crane existing electrical, pneumatic, mechanical, and structural systems to determine condition of all major systems and sub-systems to support existing 75 ton rating.  The study shall document component wear, fatigue, corrosion, previous overloads, maintenance, and years of service.  The study shall also document recommended repairs based on condition of systems.  Inspection criteria are based on Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standards (OSHA), ANSI/ASME Standard B30, National Electric Codes, and Crane Manufacturers Association of America (CMAA) published standards.

The contractor will itemize the findings into deficiency repairs and recommended repairs.  Deficiency repairs will be identified as deficiencies that must be corrected prior to receiving a certification for the crane.  Recommended repairs will be identified as not necessary for certification of the crane but highly recommended for the reliability, dependability and safety of the crane.  Provide scope of work and itemized cost estimates for deficiency and recommended repairs.  Cost estimates for repairs to be performed after the regular 1st shift with crane restored to service for the next 1st shift operation (note: if repairs require crane to be out of service for the 1st shift indicate time needed for repairs in report).  Include cost for a 100% load test after deficiencies are corrected. 

Second report shall include crane productive life expectancy with modernization/upgrade recommendations needed to extend crane productive life, reduce maintenance and operational expenses, improve reliability and safety, and reduce production downtime.  Determine the feasibility of upgrading existing 75 ton rating to a proposed 80 ton rating.  Particular attention should be given to modernization/upgrade of the crane drive & control systems which are causing out of service conditions with increasing parts unavailability due to changes in technology.  For modernization/upgrade recommendations include a Scope of Work (SOW) with specifications and itemized cost estimates to remove, replace, install and commission; new/updated engineering drawings and manuals; final inspections and tests for certification; on-site operator & maintenance training; and crane down time needed for each recommended modernization/upgrade.  Determine if any of the modernization/upgrade recommendations must be performed sole source by the original equipment manufacturer (Hydralift AMClyde) and reason(s) for sole source justification. Identify and list three potential contractors for modernization/upgrade recommendations that do not need to be performed by the OEM.

Third report shall include itemized cost estimates and Scope of Work to disassemble and remove existing crane; purchase and installation requirements for anew 75 ton rated crane meeting the design specifications of ANSI/ASME B30.4, CMAA, and OSHA requirements.  Include requirements for complete erection, and supporting steel for runway rails; electric power service; rated capacity and maximum reach a; hook lifting ranges; speeds; drive control system; dimensional requirements; crane service; special requirements; final inspections and tests for certification; on-site operator and maintenance training after final acceptance; provide sketches and complete description of features that apply and any other features or requirements that may be appropriate; and any applicable classification or permit requirements for federal, state, or local environmental regulations for the crane or any of its components.  Report shall also include recommended facility improvements if found to be necessary, and recommendations to maintain heavy lift operation mission capability during crane disassembly and replacement.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

GN2 is FOB origin from the contractor’s facility. The resultant contract will be a five-year, fixed price requirements-type contract.  The contract ordering period will be from 1 May 2006 through 30 Apr 2011. The estimated yearly GN2 Pipeline requirements are 350,000 MC (Thousand Cubic Feet) for the first year; 400,000 MC for the second year; 350,000 MC for the third year; 300,000 MC for the fourth year; and 300,000 MC for the fifth year.

C.  BACKGROUND:  The IRS’ MITS Organization’s Enterprise Operations Services mission is to provide efficient, cost effective, secure and highly reliable computing (server and mainframe) services for all IRS business entities and taxpayers, and to manage the day-to-day operations of the network and contact center environments.  To accomplish parts of its mission, Enterprise Operations Services deploys and maintains an infrastructure capable of supporting the business and administrative needs of the Service for both the current environment and modernized operations; standardizes, consolidates and manages the mainframe computing infrastructure, and ancillary systems/software; maintains and modifies systems software products for the IRS mainframe-computing environment; implements appropriate security and mission assurance tools, processes, procedures, and infrastructure related to corporate computing services; provides services to business units/divisions within established Service Level Agreements (SLA); provides enterprise network operational support; and performs design, deployment, and maintenance of the contact center environment. 
 
D. DESIRED INFORMATION:  Md (7) performs design, deployment, and maintenance of the contact center environment. 

D.  DESIRED INFORMATION:  MITS is in the process of analyzing and reviewing their approach, practices, and procedures for performing Tier 1 Mainframe Hardware Maintenance and Software Maintenance activities.  The Government is interested in finding out about new approaches, best practices or industry standards that could better meet its needs.  The information obtained from this RFI is intended to provide the Government with a better understanding of the methodologies, best practices, performance metrics, and service level agreements available to them in todays marketplace.

SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST:  Following are examples of “Areas of Interest” where the Government is seeking information.  This listing is not intended to be exhaustive or all-inclusive, therefore vendors may provide additional information that they deem relevant as long as the total number of allowed pages (i.e., 20 pages) are not exceeded.  

(1)  Program Management.  The Government is interested in understanding how commercial vendors manage Mainframe Hardware Maintenance and/or Mainframe Software Maintenance contracts.  What is the vendor’s philosophy?  What is the vendor’s approach to development and management of Service Level Agreements (SLAs)?  What is the vendor’s approach to performance metrics?  What reporting mechanisms does the vendor employ?  What is the vendor’s approach to continuous process improvement?

(2)  Mainframe Hardware Maintenance and/or Software Maintenance Processes and Procedures.  How are vendors performing the maintenance lifecycle beginning with receipt of trouble tickets to close out of corrected action, asset tracking, capacity planning, and delivery methods?

(3)  Repair Services.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor all components of the repair services cycle?

(4)  Preventive Maintenance.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor required preventive maintenance services for the hardware and software?

(5)  Equipment Disposal.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor the activities associated with the removal and disposal of excess, broken, and outdated equipment?

(6)  Warranty Management.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor a comprehensive process for warranty management services?

(7)  Software Upgrades.  How will the vendor plan, manage, implement, and monitor a comprehensive process to maintain and upgrade software (commercial and firmware) with the latest versions available?

INDUSTRY COMMENTS:  The release of this RFI affords industry the opportunity to comment on any perceived issues with regard to the initiative and to allow the Government to receive the benefit of industry comments.  The Government’s purpose in providing an opportunity for industry comment is to identify potential problem areas and provide alternative recommendations in order to enhance the success of the initiative.  The Government believes industry feedback is important.  The Government is receptive to any and all ideas from industry which would result in limiting unnecessarily constraining requirements, realizing cost savings, or highlighting potential technical or contractual problem areas associated with the initiative.  What new capabilities within the past five years have provided the biggest ROI?  Describe what you see as the industry trend over the next five years.  What has been your experience in performance-based delivery methods and techniques?  Describe your experience with performance-based and/or incentives-based contracts. 

SERVICE LEVEL/PERFORMANCE METRICS.  The Government is interested in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and Performance Metrics used by industry to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of hardware and software maintenance support.  The Government is interested in operational metrics (those used to monitor day-to-day activities) and management metrics (those used by management to gauge key indicators of success, executive dashboard, etc.).     Additionally, the Government is interested in how industry balances using leading (forecasting) and lagging (static) metrics.  Since the Government is exploring the use of a performance-based contracting approach, it would be helpful to understand the service levels/performance metrics used to manage the operations, and those metrics used as a basis for payment.     

Questions to the Government may be included under separate cover for all submissions.

This is not a solicitation announcement and this notice does not constitute any commitment by the Government. The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources.

The Yuma Area Office has a future requirement for the Operations and Maintenance (O&M) of Yuma Desalting Plant (YDP); The Water Quality Improvement Center (WQIC) research facility; and  The Analytical Laboratory Service (ALS) located at 7301 Calle Agua Salada, Yuma, Arizona.

The goal of the National Centers Program is to promote improved water-treatment processes through united research efforts by government, academia, and private industry.

The Analytical Laboratory supports the YDP, WQIC and other Government authorized operations by performing chemical, biological, and physical tests; and preparing the data for engineering and data reporting. The mission of the WQIC is to advance the development and transfer of water purification technologies at its state-of-the-art facility through field tests, hands-on training, and implementation. The varying levels of research focus on the following research goals: (1) analytical laboratory services for YDP and the YAO; (2) to reduce the cost to operate and maintain the YDP; (3) securing safe, clean water supplies for the West now and in the future; and (4) transferring federally-developed technology to the public pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986. Comments and information on the following are requested:  (1) company name, address, point of contact and their telephone number and e-mail address; (2) Approximate annual gross  revenue; (3) Any small business status (8(a), HUBZone, veteran-owned, women-owned, etc.); (4) Indicate the magnitude of previous similar contracts and references thereto including point of contact name, telephone and/or e-mail address.

<CONTACT>Gabrielle Trickett, 703-432-3616
<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, Virginia seeks sources and information for Integrated Trailer-Generator-Environmental Control Unit systems. A potential USMC need is emerging for an integrated system that includes a diesel engine-generator set, Environmental Control Unit (ECU), and off-road capable trailer, capable of sustained operation in temperatures ranging from -20 degrees F to +135 degrees F. Additional stowage space for other missions equipment on the trailer is strongly desired (such as tentage). The diesel/JP-8 fueled engine-generator set shall provide between 10-20 kilowatts of power, over and above what is required for the Environmental Control Unit (ECU).  Electric power shall be provided at 120/208 VAC, 3-phase, 60 Hz, 0.8 PF. The ECU shall be able to provide between 90,000-120,000 BTU/hr of air conditioning and 40,000-60,000 BTU/hr of heating capacity under the same environmental conditions of the electric generator. The overall system shall be!   trailer mounted and suitable for tow behind a HMMWV A2 configuration in severe off-road conditions (70% off-road, 30% on-road), shall be capable of 30-inch water-fording with no preparation, and 60-inch water-fording (salt water) with no more than 30 minutes preparation. The system shall provide for anti-wet-stacking of the engine under partial electrical load condition down to 30% total electrical output. It is a desired capability to operate in parallel two generators for simultaneous and additive capability.  The Government is interested in obtaining one representative system, under a separate bailment arrangement to be established, for the purposes of testing at Aberdeen Proving Grounds (APG).  Testing is envisioned to commence in June of 2006, with delivery of systems to APG, Aberdeen Maryland desired no later than 1 June.  Copies of all testing results will be provided to each vendor on their respective system. Commercial firms possessing the characteristics noted in the above system description are encouraged and invited to submit the following:  • Product brochures and pricing materials outlining specifications, to include a statement of capabilities.  • Current GSA contract information regarding unit pricing and discounts. General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) may be an appropriate method for these supplies and services (Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 8.0 and 8.4). • Operations / maintenance / parts manual for the unit (if requested by the vendor, the manuals will be returned after Government review).  • Independent or in-house test data.  • Accessories needed for equipment operation, and whether or not the accessories are included with the unit or sold separately.   Responses will be reviewed to identify firms potentially capable of fulfilling the Governments requirements. This sources-sought/Request For Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request For Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire follow-on acquisition.      The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested.   No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.      The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort.  If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.      Responses to this RFI shall be mailed to Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: Gabrielle Trickett-GTES-EPS, 2200 Lester Ave, Quantico, VA 22134-6050 no later than 15 Feb 2006.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) makes and distributes for free over the Internet, official NOAA Raster Navigational Charts (NOAA RNCs™).  These NOAA RNCs are digital, raster versions of the official nautical charts.  They are distributed in the .BSB format used by numerous commercially available navigation software packages.  NOAA distributes both RNCs to which Notice to Mariners chart corrections are applied every week, and cumulative electronic updates that may be used to update previously distributed RNCs.  RNCs downloaded by an end user from NOAA’s Internet site (www.NauticalChart.NOAA.gov) are official NOAA RNCs™, and satisfy federal chart carriage regulations where permitted by the Code of Federal Regulations.  


In order to increase the distribution and use of NOAA RNCs, a network of certified distributors is being established.  Certified RNC distributors may download official NOAA RNCs, redistribute, repackage, package with additional data and services, and sell the resulting product for whatever price they choose.  NOAA RNCs redistributed by a certified distributor acting in conformance with the distributorship Agreement retain their official status, and may be used to meet chart carriage regulations where permitted by the Code of Federal Regulations.  No other method of redistribution provides this official status for the RNCs.


The NOAA RNC distributorship Agreement and instructions for application are posted on the Internet and can be reached from the Office of Coast Survey, NOAA homepage at www.NauticalCharts.NOAA.gov/.  Questions may be directed to Captain Jim Gardner, NOAA, (e-mail:  Jim.Gardner@NOAA.gov, Phone:  301-713-2724 x101, Fax:  301-713-4516).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) requires an upgrade to a Ti:Sapphire laser that was recently purchased.  The upgrade is required in order to undertake a newly funded competence project.  In order to obtain larger pulse energies, NIST requires a “cavity dumper”.  The cavity dumper reduces the pulse repetition rate, but increases the pulse energy.  Higher pulse energies are required in order to enable efficient “second harmonic generation,” also known as frequency doubling, which is a nonlinear process that generates light at twice the wavelength of the input light.
	The Ti:Sapphire laser that NIST will upgrade is a Coherent Mira 900-D.  This product is a highly specialized laser which only Coherent is capable of providing a cavity dumper with a second harmonic generation option designed specifically for this laser.  NIST also requires a pump laser for this Ti:Sapphire laser, and Coherent will only guarantee that the cavity-dumped Ti:Sapphire meets its specifications if it is pumped with a Coherent laser.  NIST requires at least a 50 nJ/pulse (wavelength of 800 nm) with a pulse width 100-175 fs at a repetition rate of > 100 kHz.
	The upgraded T:Sapphhire laser is required to meet all of the following specifications:

1)	Pulse energies > 50 nJ/pulse from 800-900 nm wavelength, at pulse repetition rates up to 100 kHz
2)	Pulse repetition rates from single shot to 8 Mhz or greater if possible
3)	Required pump laser input 5 W at 532 nm
4)	Pulse width 100-175 fs
5)	The second harmonic generation must have an efficiency of at least 35%.

All of the necessary components required to upgrade the existing Ti:Sapphire laser, including a pump laser and second harmonic generation equipment, must be included. There is no bid package available.  The Government intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, with Coherent, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, under 41 USC 253(c)(1), “Only one responsible source”.  This notice may represent the only official notice of a solicitation.

SERVICE LEVEL/PERFORMANCE METRICS.  The Government is extremely interested in Service Level Agreements and Performance Metrics used by industry to measure the efficiency and effectiveness of this mainframe HW & SW maintenance support.  The Government is interested in operational metrics (those used to monitor day-to-day activities) and management metrics (those used by management to gauge key indicators of success, executive dashboard, etc.).  Additionally, the Government is interested in how industry balances using leading (forecasting) and lagging (static) metrics.  Since the Government is exploring the use of a performance-based contracting approach, it would be helpful to understand the service levels/performance metrics used to manage the operations, and those metrics used as a basis for payment.

<SUBJECT>Advanced Skirt Technology for current Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) and Sea Base-to-Shore Connector (SSC) craft that may employ an air cushion system. REVISION ONE (1)
<DESC>THIS SYNOPSIS WAS ORGINALLY PUBLISHED ON OR ABOUT 14 NOVEMBER 2005 (DON-SNOTE 051116-001). THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVISION IS TO UPDATE AND ADD THE FOLOWING INFORMATION: 1.	ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST APPLIES TO THIS ACTION AND ANY RESULTANT AWARD AS DEFINED IN FAR SUBPART 9.5, ORGANIZATIONAL AND CONSULTANT CONFLICTS OF INTEREST; AND 2.	ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS OF PROPOSAL ARE ACCEPTABLE. ADVANCED SKIRT TECHNOLOGY Introduction: This publication constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2).  A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this announcement will not be issued. Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) will not issue paper copies of this announcement.  NSWC PC reserves the right to select for award all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NSWC PC reserves the right to fund all, some or none of the proposals received under this BAA.  NSWC PC provides no funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Technical and cost proposals (or any other material) submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  It is the policy of NSWC PC to treat all proposals as sensitive, competitive information and to disclose their contents only for the purposes of evaluation. Background: This program supports one of the Seabasing Future Naval Capabilities (FNC) programs, High-Speed Sea Base-to-Shore Connector Technologies (HSSBSC), managed by the Office of Naval Research (ONR).  One area of interest in this FNC program is the enhanced Sea State capability of the Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) and the Sea Base-to-Shore Connector (SSC).  The earliest LCACs will reach the end of their 30-year service life beginning in 2014.  The LCAC replacement, the SSC, is in the initial stages.  Since the Seabasing Capability Based Assessment is still under development, a spiral development approach may be needed to accommodate this timeline.  The SSC will be similar in width to the present LCAC and operated from the legacy amphibious fleet while the length may vary from existing to 1.5 the current length.  Ship to Objective Maneuver (STOM) concepts as well as tactical operational experience has dictated that the replacement LCACs have an increased sea state operational c!  apability while still being able to enter/operate/exit an existing amphibious ship’s well deck.  Under this BAA, NSWC-PC is soliciting proposals for advanced skirt technology (skirt, seals, fingers, etc.) for current Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) and SSC craft that may employ an air cushion system.  The cushion must allow the vessel to transport weapons systems, equipment, cargo, and personnel from ship-to-shore and over the beach in up to a significant wave height of 6.2 feet (threshold)/10.6 feet (objective) (SS4/5)  environment.  In a typical mission, the craft will embark equipment, troops, and/or supplies; launch from amphibious ships (LHA, LHD, LPD-17, etc.); transit at high speed to the beach under assault; transit the surf zone and beach; proceed inland to a suitable offload site; offload rapidly; and return to the amphibious ship for reload and follow-on sorties.  The objective of the advanced skirt is to allow current LCAC and future connector craft the ability to perform Sea Base-to-Shore missions in significant wave height of 6.2 feet (threshold)/10.6 fe!  et (objective) (SS4/5) while still being compatible with legacy amphibious ships whose well decks were designed to accommodate craft up to the height and width of a current LCAC on cushion (49 ft wide and up to 25’-10” high).  This will require advances in skirt technology, as the LCAC was designed to be capable of performing ship-to-shore missions only up to sea state 3.  One possible concept for increasing sea state capability while maintaining well deck compatibility is a variable geometry skirt that will enable the craft to enter/operate/exit the well deck in one configuration and to use a different configuration for at-sea operation and beach landing. Program Plan: Three phases of development are envisioned for the advanced skirt technology.  Phase I is the base phase with the government’s option to award Phase II and Phase III.  The first phase of the program would consist of multiple awards requiring the following tasks: advanced skirt preliminary designs, trade study, feasibility study, full-scale skirt material selection and evaluation, operational design parameters for the variable geometry, and computer simulations of vehicle motion, air cushion pressures and flow, material static and dynamic loads, and craft performance and drag.  Phase I will also require 2-dimensional model testing to be conducted at the vendor’s facilities.  The 2-dimensional testing will be a 1/5 model-scale athwartship section of the skirt, including both the port and starboard sides.  The section will be inflated on a model hull section that is unconstrained in the vertical direction and operates over a static solid and water surface.  These tests will ver!  ify and demonstrate the variable geometry functioning of the skirt, using variable lift airflow, mechanical retraction, or whatever other means the design concept will employ in order to operate in the well deck. The tests will also verify the inflated skirt balance and stability and provide an opportunity for design refinements before incorporation into a complete 3-dimensional skirt system.  Phase I is anticipated to last for 7 months. The government has the option and anticipates selection of the two or three most promising concepts and award Phase II contracts.  The Phase II effort will develop the advanced skirt concept from the previous phase into a 3-dimensional design and construct a sub-scale skirt that will be tested on an appropriate tow tank test model identified by the government.  A sub-scale skirt scalable to the existing LCAC will be constructed, and a skirt scalable to 1.5 times that of the existing LCAC may also be required (depending on the results of the analysis from Phase I).  The government will select an appropriate test facility (or facilities) and conduct head-to-head tow tank and possible surf zone testing of the competing designs with contractor involvement.  Phase II is anticipated to last for 8 months.  It is anticipated that the government would then select one or two Phase III awards for full-scale prototype design and fabrication of an advanced skirt system for installation on an existing LCAC (or LCACs).  The contractor will also be required to install skirt system on existing LCAC (with assistance from NSWC-PC) at an appropriate facility and assist the government in testing.  Phase III is anticipated to have a period of performance of 9 months. Under this solicitation, the government requires a detailed cost proposal for Phase I, along with rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost estimates for Phases II and Phase III.  The deliverables for Phase I and II will include a firm price cost proposal for the subsequent phase. As part of the Phase I and Phase II design process, the government will require the awardees to demonstrate/calculate how the prototype could be scaled up from the existing LCAC length to a length up to 1.5 times that of the current LCAC. Desired capabilities of the Advanced Skirt System: The following is a list of requirements and the desired thresholds/objectives for the Advanced Skirt design: Requirements List: 1.	The skirt system must allow the LCAC to enter/operate/exit Navy Amphibious Ship Well Decks (L-Class Ships).  In well deck entry/exit mode skirt maximum on–cushion width would be 49 ft, and the maximum length would not substantially exceed the current Deep Skirt length of 91’-9”; LCAC maximum height with skirt would be 25’-10” threshold and 24’-4” objective. 2.	Advanced Skirt must be compatible with current Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) and be scalable to a vessel up to 1.5 times the length of the current LCAC (i.e. approximately 138 ft). 3.	Advanced skirt outer attachment points will be the same as the current LCAC.  Inner skirt attachment points have the potential for relocation.  4.	Advanced skirt system will utilize current LCAC lift fans and ducting: For information, each of the four double-discharge, double width, double inlet (DWDI) lift fans of the existing LCAC were designed to produce static pressure of 165 psf gauge at a nominal lift air flow rate of 2028 cfs, at design point ambient conditions of standard atmospheric pressure and air temperature of 80oF.   5.	Advanced skirt to be capable of wet well emergency LCAC recovery with the ship ballasted to 5 ft of water at the well deck sill, without the skirt snagging or catching on ship structure or otherwise impeding recovery. Thresholds/Objectives: Notional Requirements		Threshold			Objectives Sea State Capability			SS4				SS5 (at approx 35 kts)			(Significant Wave		(Significant Wave Height 					Height 6.2 ft)			10.6 ft) Application and Submission Information: Proposals shall consist of two separately bound volumes; Volume I shall provide the technical proposal and management approach and Volume II shall address cost.

Evaluation criteria for the three phases will be developed prior to the awarding of each phase.  In general, the phases will be evaluated based on feasibility, potential performance, risk, complexity, maintenance issues, and cost. Proposals are to be submitted by 1500 on 01/20/2006. Proposals submitted after that date may be evaluated by the Government but will be considered to be of less priority for funding. Note:  Contractors will be required to submit a second, more detailed Phase II and Phase III cost proposal as a deliverable of Phase I and Phase II respectively.  However, only contractors who were awarded a Phase I contract will be considered for Phase II and only those awarded a Phase II contract will be considered for Phase III. The Government reserves the right to select for funding any, all, part or none of the responses received. For efforts funded as contracts, evaluation of the socio-economic merits will include the extent of commitment in providing meaningful subcontracting opportunities for small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and historically black colleges and universities.  This is to notify potential offerors that each contract that may be placed under this announcement, or solicitation to an institution of higher education must include the following clause:  “As a condition for receipt of funds available to the Department of Defense (DoD) under this award, the recipient agrees that it is not an institution that has a policy of denying, and that it is not an institution that effectively prevents the Secretary of Defense from obtaining for military recruiting purposes: (A) an entry to campuses or access to students on campuses; or (B) access to!   directory information pertaining to students.  If the recipient is determined, using procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558 of Public Law 103-337 (1994), to be such an institution during the period of performance of this agreement, and therefore to be in breach of this clause, the Government will cease all payments of DoD funds under this agreement and all other DoD grants and cooperative payments unilaterally for material failure to comply with the terms and conditions of award.” If your institution has been identified under the procedures established by the Secretary of Defense to implement Section 558, then: (1) no funds available to DoD may be provided to your institution through any contract, including any existing contract, (2) as a matter of policy, this restriction also applies to any cooperative agreement, and (3) your institution is not eligible to receive a contract or cooperative agreement in response to this solicitation." See instructions above for pre-proposals and proposals. The Government’s preference is to award definitive contracts under this BAA. However, an award can be made via grant at the sole discretion of the Government.  All responsive sources may submit proposals that will be considered by NSWC PC. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Institutions (MI) are encouraged to submit proposals or join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for HBCU and MI participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete and severable areas of submarine escape, rescue, and diving for exclusive competition among these entities.  This announcement constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d) (2) (i).  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Technical content questions should be addressed to Mr. John Ducote. Interested parties are invited to respond to this synopsis. All responsible parties will be considered. POC and address to mail pre-proposals and proposals:  NSWC PC, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 3240!  7-7015, Attn: Mr. John Ducote, Code E32, or E-mail: john.ducote@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>R -- Web-Based Language Learning Application—Completion of the U.S.- China E-Language Learning System
<DESC>Any questions or comments regarding this announcement should be e-mailed to Deila.Cockburn@ed.gov by January 25, 2006.  The deadline for the responses to the two questions (including Statements of Capability) are due on February 9, 2006 via e-mail to deila.cockburn@ed.gov.  


The U.S. Department of Education (ED) is conducting market research to complete a multimedia web-based English language learning application.   The Department has developed the underlying E-Language Learning System (ELLS) which is a web-based application that combines language-learning research with a gaming approach and structured immersion pedagogy to teach English and Chinese as second languages.  Information provided will help guide future efforts for development, testing, and evaluation of ELLS.  The communication skills of listening and speaking are emphasized.  ED wants to ensure that it has the best available technology solutions to test and evaluate this language-learning pedagogy.


ELLS is an ED research and development project administered by the Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy Development, Policy and Program Studies Service.  ED has developed this project with the Ministry of Education, People’s Republic of China (PRC), through a 2001 Memorandum of Understanding.  Both countries agreed to develop the ELLS application as parallel systems- one to teach English to Chinese speakers and the other to teach Chinese to English speakers.  


The purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness of a new approach to second language instruction.  ED believes that the approach could prove to be an important advance in second language instruction, and, after complete development, intends to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the approach and to disseminate its evaluation findings to the public.  Dissemination will occur in consultation with a technical working group to be formed from interested private and public organizations.


Information about the system is available online at http://www.chengoresearch.com/. 


Information Gathering:  ED seeks responses to two questions that can be addressed separately or together by the respondents and should be submitted via email by February 9, 2006.


Question 1:  What new technologies are available to augment or enhance existing features and/or accelerate development and reduce costs?   ED seeks information on whether there are newer technologies, including commercial-off-the-shelf software (COTS tools), that would enhance or replace the existing application components described below, for the purpose of lowering final development costs, improving functionality and performance, and/or allowing replication to other languages or subjects.  Proprietary restrictions should be avoided, as the Department intends to share its testing and development findings with the public that may include information about the technology and software.  System features must be 508 compliant, allowing access for physically impaired users.


The current web-based system consists of the following components:
1. Application engine; 2. A storyline embedded in Flash animation;
3. Supporting learning resources (such as a multimedia online dictionary); 4. Practice exercises embedded in games; 5. Speech recognition; 6. Database providing system functionality and learning management; 7. Client-side operations; and 8. Server-side operations.


The Department’s intent is to advance work of the language learning technology industry.  To this end, the Department wants to identify the best way to work with industry so that industry participates in the development and enhancement of the E-Language Learning System and can then use the findings of this research and development effort in future products for the advancement of the field.


When responding to this question please include the following:  1) Company Name and Mailing Address; 2) Point of Contact (name, title, telephone number); and 3) A brief description of your experience in developing: web-based applications; multi-media, on-line resources; games; speech recognition; learning management systems, or other technology functionality pertinent to the E-Language Learning System. 


Question 2:  Are you interested in working as part of a consortium that could include diverse partners such as members from information technology and software development companies, language learning experts and industry participants, local and state governments, universities, foundations, etc. who, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education, would finalize, test, and evaluate ELLS?


ED seeks information from qualified organizations that may be willing to work with ED  to finalize, test, and evaluate the effectiveness of the E-Language Learning System.  ED seeks information from these members of the private sector and others who are interested in providing additional resources, including technical expertise and financial resources, either individually or as part of a consortium, to support this next phase of finalizing, evaluating, and testing ELLS.  


In addition to a statement expressing interest in participating in the ELLS project, interested parties are asked to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC) to ED including the  following information (if not already provided in response to Question 1):  1) Company Name and Mailing Address; 2) Point of Contact (name, title, telephone number); and 3) A brief description of your experience in developing: web-based applications; multi-media, on-line resources; games; speech recognition; learning management systems, or other technology functionality pertinent to the E-Language Learning System. 


This announcement is being used to determine if sufficient interest and capability exists regarding potential future solicitations. This notice is provided as information to the marketplace and is an invitation for interest and an expression of interest to partner.  Information submitted in response to this announcement may be used as a basis for future solicitations and/or as a basis for more indepth research of an organization’s capability. 


The Government will not pay for the provision of any information nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information. This notice is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS and in no way obligates the Government to award any contract.  ED will not be responsible for any costs incurred in responding to this notice.

The Automated Standard Application for Payment (ASAP) system is utilized by the Federal Government
for paying grants, contracts and other programs. Under a payment cleared financing arrangement, the
Contractor issues payments for program costs. When the payments are cleared by the financial
institution, the financial institution draws on an ASAP 1031 account at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Richmond. The amount of the drawdown calculated by the financial institution should be sufficient to
maintain the account balance net positive and as close to zero as administratively possible. To receive
sameday credit from the Federal Reserve, the financial institution ascertains the amount of payment
items received for payment net of the amount of any deposits and submits an online payment request to
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond by 5:45 p.m. Eastern time.
The financial institution shall be compensated by direct payment of fee.

A detailed description of the services to be provided, instructions for the submission of proposals and
other pertinent documents including a sample agreement between the financial institution, the
Government, and the Contractors are included in the RFP.
Battelle and a Source Selection Committee of the other Hanford Contractors shall award the agreements
on behalf of the Hanford Contractors identified above, using the payments cleared funding method to a
single financial institution. The award shall result in four Special Financial lnstitution Account(s)
Agreements between each Hanford Contractor, DOE and the Financial Institution. The Special Financial
lnstitution Account(s) Agreements shall be for an initial two-year period with three one-year options for a
total of five years, if the options are exercised.

Requests for explanation or interpretation should be submitted in writinq by January 19, 2006 to the
following address:

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costa that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

All responsi ble sources may submit an offer, which will be considered by this agency.  DESCRIPTION:  This contract is for a basic contract work period in 2006 with optional work periods in 2007 and 2008.  The Government may include one, two or all three of the work periods in the final contract.  The Government will select the work alternati ves that best suit its purposes and available funding. LOCATION AND EXTENT OF WORK.  Work will be performed in the area between  Lower Granite Reservoir (near Lewiston, ID) and near Portland, OR on the Columbia  River.  Additional work may be performed between Portland, OR and Astoria, OR  depending on the options exercised.   The Contractor shall provide equipment and  perform services for the following operations: JUVENILE FISH BARGE TRANSPORT PROGRAM -  The Contractor shall provide four towboats, each staffed with crews for 24-hour per day operation, to transport  Government-owned fish barges from Lower Granite Juvenile Fish Facility to fish release areas below Bonneville Dam.  Stops will be made at Little Goose and Lower  Monumental dams to load additional fish or to pick up an additional fish barge for  transport to the release site.  The initiation of barging will be based on runoff projections.  During years when runoff is forecasted to be near or above normal or average runoff, barging of fish will begin on April 21.  During low flow or drought years, barging of fish may begin as early as 8 April.  Transporting of fish by barge from Snake River dams will therefore begin sometime between  April 8 and April 21, and should last through August 16, but could end earlier depending on fish collection numbers. BONNEVILLE MID-RIVER RELEASE -  The Contractor shall provide a towboat and  flat decked, ramp-type barge to be stationed somewhere below Bonneville Dam from  approximately August 15 through approximately October 31.

CONTRACT PERIOD.  The towboats provided under this contract shall be provided  between approximately April 6, 2006 and October 31, 2006 as specified above.  Because all dates in this contract are approximate dates which are effected by the seasonal migration of fish, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to expand periods within  the contract as necessary to protect the fish runs.
