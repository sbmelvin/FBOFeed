<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, plans to make a non-competitive award via written request for quotation No. 05ER15-No Solicitation number to Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. Olympia, WA. for Bald Eagle survey on (25) 10 x 10 km plot in Western and (8) 10 x 10 plot in Eastern Washington. These surveys use existing information from state surveys in the conjunction with additional surveys to efficiently estimate number of nesting eagles. State biologists are needed to assist in conducting surveys, coordinating and participating in the surveys following a specific protocol, and in summarizing the results of the survey.   Specifically, the state of Washington will recruit observers for eagle surveys in their state,  arrange for the implementation of a specific protocol for conducting the surveys, coordinate the survey in conjunction with their state biologists and field staff,  supervise the data management to ensure that the formats and information in the protocols are properly collected and entered into computers, and reconcile the information collected on the survey plots with the historical databases to determine which nests are new and which represent existing nests. The State of Washington has collected and maintained the historical database of eagle nests in the state, and state personnel are uniquely qualified to conduct surveys and interpret data.  A critical component of this experiment requires that eagle nests observed during the surveys be evaluated to determine whether they are part of the list maintained by the state, and only state biologists with field experience with the eagle nests are qualified to make that evaluation. U.S. Geological Survey anticipates awarding this to Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. Olympia, WA. THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The anticipated award date is 04/25/2005, under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold of $100,000.00. Delivery is required by 07/30/2005.  NAICS is 541990.  Information will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Determination to compete this requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice must be submitted to http://ideasec.nbc.gov.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to procure from single source a DS5X Water Quality Instrument.  Contractor:  HACH/Hydrolab of San Refael, California.  I. DESCRIPTION OF ITEM:  The Hydrolab DataSonde Multiprobe is scientific equipment that is designed to utilize attached sensors  (pH, dissolved oxygen, conductance, and turbidity sensors ) to measure water quality parameters under field conditions.  II. PURPOSE OF ITEM:  Hydrolab DataSonde Multiprobes and pH, dissolved oxygen, conductance, and turbidity sensors with internal memory are needed to measure water quality parameters in salt ponds on a continuous basis as required by regulatory agencies to fulfill the stipulations of our RWQCB discharge permit. Meters will be deployed continuously to monitor water quality of pond discharge. III. CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRING SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT: The Hydrolab DataSonde is compatible with our existing Surveyor 4 hand-held interface unit. Purchase of a competitor's unit would require the purchase of a new interface unit. The Hydrolab DataSondes will be used for continued monitoring of salt ponds using an existing protocol that was established with a Hydrolab MiniSonde in 1999 and continued using  five Hydrolab DataSondes during 2004; thus, similar units should be used for future measurements to ensure consistent data quality over time and an accurate assessment of temporal changes in pond water quality. Water quality meters of comparable quality lack the compatibility with existing equipment, would disrupt data consistency, and are more costly.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS intends to negotiate with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI  on a sole source basis  in accordance with the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253  (c)  (1) only one responsible  source to provide services for the Derive Biomass Burning Emissions from GOES Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning (WF-ABBA) Fire Products. The University of Wisconsin has developed, tested, and implemented several algorithms related to GOES fire and emissions products. This will improve forecasts of aerosols (PM2.5, particulate mass for particles with diameter <2.5 um) and visibility. This will provide support for the development and technology transition to NCEP operations of a prototype system that can derive emissions from GOES WF ABBA fire products and assimilation fore satellite-derived emissions into air quality forecast system to improve PM2.5 and visibility forecasts. Tasks 1) compiling databases for fuel loads (land cover and  vegetation  maps) and emission factor for the U.S. 2) developing methodologies to derive particulate emissions using fire information from satellites, fuel load and emission factor databases, and information on fuel consumption. 3)  analyzing case studies and as necessary developing analysis tools that will allow the comparison of emissions derived from difference (satellite and non-satellite) systems. NOAA will collaborate with the University of Wisconsin to build data bases of fuel loads, emission factors, and combustion fractions. Develop methodologies by using existing and new techniques to derive smoke particulate emissions from wildland/prescribed fries for U.S. Apply the algorithms for test episodes and evaluate the outputs. Compare GOES WF ABBA emissions to those derived from MODIS based algorithms and other non-satellite based algorithms, develop tools as necessary. 

Offerors certain they can meet the requirement are requested to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS, intends to negotiate with The City University of New York, Research Foundation, New York, NY  Center for Atmospheric Sciences (CAS) under the Hampton University /Crest Program on a sole source basis in accordance with the authority of 41 U. S. C. 253 ( c ) (1), only one responsible source.  The CREST Program is a collaboration of Universities in the NYC metropolitan area including CUNY, NEW York, directed in part at Minorities, for a the continued study of GOES Surface Ultraviolet Radiation Product. The facility at Hampton University has extensive experience in retrieving surface radiation, including ultraviolet radiation, from satellite measurements. They have derived surface radiation budget (SRB) from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System and conducted a thorough analysis of the accuracies using high quality surface measurement including data from SURFRAD and those collected at the site of the CERES Ocean Validation Experiment (COVE). Members of CAS are already familiar with many elements of the GOES UV Project.  The University has contributed to many of the validation data sets planned for the evaluation of the GOES Surface Ultraviolet Radiation Product. At the present time the surface UV flux is estimated experimentally from the visible radiance measured by the imager instrument onboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). Presently, the surface UV flux is estimated offline, in near real-time, using inputs from two systems. One system is the Continental United States (CONUS) GOES Surface and Insolation Product (CONUS GSIP) system that provides the necessary radiances and auxiliary data at a 0.5-degree latitude/longitude grid and uses column amount of ozone from the NOAA Stratosphere Monitoring Ozone Blended Analysis (SMOBA).  The second system is the full-disk GSIP system with a latitude/longitude resolution of 1/8 of a degree and which ingests the NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS) total column amount of ozone.  Surface UV is estimated identically in both systems, but cloud detection and sources of auxiliary data are different.  The work to be performed will be to evaluate and improve the estimates of surface ultraviolet fluxes derived from GOES. The evaluation will include, but not limited to, comparison with ground measurements (SURFRAD, USDA UV-B Monitoring Network) and comparison with independently derived satellite estimates (TOMS< CERES).  The contractor shall build a system (software + data) for the evaluation of the GOES surface UV product. Evaluate the GOES surface UV product using ground data and independent satellite estimates. Assist in improving the GOES UV retrieval. 

Offerors certain they can meet the requirement are request to submit in writing an affirmative response and technical capabilities. All written responses must include a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information demonstrating their ability to meet the above requirements. Failure to submit such documentation will result in the government proceeding as stated above.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIRSYSCOM) has a requirement for Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) Integration and Independent Test and Evaluation (IT&E) support.  This acquisition will provide systems engineering services needed by the Precision Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) in support of all JDAM variants at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida.  The contractor will provide IT&E support for: (1) existing and deployed JDAM configurations, (2) JDAM systems and subsystems (including Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Mechanism (SAASM) and Anti-Jam (AJ)) currently under development for deployment in the near term, and (3) JDAM hardware and software modifications and upgrades that will affect both existing and future production variants through Production Lot 12.  

NAVAIR intends to award this requirement on a sole source basis to Engineering Management Concepts, Inc. (EMC), 295 Willis Avenue, Suite B, Camarillo, CA 93010.  Since 1996, EMC has been the sole provider of IT&E support for the JDAM.  EMC is the only known source with the capability to perform this requirement without resulting in significant schedule delays for the program.

The contractor shall provide test and evaluation planning, resource assessment, data collection and data analysis support.  The contractor shall make recommendations for improvements to the systems or resolution of problems related to the systems necessary to support continued JDAM production.  The contractor shall revise and update management information related to program responsibilities and provide recommendations for the development of management information systems.  The contractor shall participate in the preparation and review of specifications, statements of work, and Contract Data Requirements Lists for follow-on production contracts utilizing an up-to-date database.  The contractor shall assess known and potential operational capability deficiencies and make recommendations for correction.  The contractor shall provide management and technical support for JDAM development and upgrades related to aircraft integration on the F/A-18 and other aircraft platforms.  Support will include preparation of weapon vehicle hardware configuration data packages and draft flight clearances.  The contractor shall provide technical advise, conduct studies, analyze options, and prepare reports and briefings on implementing the latest initiatives and techniques for the JDAM RDT&E program.  The contractor shall travel, as required, to participate in field, laboratory, and other testing and to participate in test planning.  The contractor shall assist with aircraft/weapon integration, load tests, support equipment integration, shock tests, container qualification, transportation certification, and carrier suitability/operability of the JDAM and Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) systems.  The contractor shall assist in the collection of metrics on program progress and provide recommendations to mitigate risk to program costs/budgets and assist with the achievement of program goals.  The contractor shall provide financial analyses, budgeting and cost comparisons to support JDAM plans, technical tests, and executions.  

Experience with a wide variety of software is required for this effort, including SAP; PBIS; Workload Planning System; Standard Accounting Reporting System; Health of Naval Aviation; Defense System Acquisition Consolidated System; and the Consolidated Acquisition Reporting System.  Familiarity with unique equipment, performance parameters, and operation of the MK-82 variant, MK-83 variant, MK-84 variant, BLU-109 variant, and PGK are vital to the successful performance of this contract.

The anticipated period of performance is 12 months from the date of award, with the potential for four (4) one-year option periods.  

It is anticipated that the SIC code for this requirement will be 8711 and that the NAICS code will be 541330.  

Other interested parties may submit a brief one-page statement demonstrating their capability to perform the services listed above if they believe they possess the required knowledge and ability to perform this requirement.  These responses may be submitted via email to candice.higgs@navy.mil or may be faxed to (301) 757-6516, Attn: Candice Higgs, Code 2.5.1.8.1.7.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue Call Order # NND05AB63D under Scaled Composites, LLC BPA No. E05479D for commercial "Wet Lease" of the Proteus Aircraft and other Proteus Related Aircraft Services.  Requirements are to support a Research/Engineering mission to demonstrate Cooperative Collision Avoidance (CCA) technologies that may enable routine “file and fly” operations in the National Airspace System (NAS).  From June 2005 until October 2005, Scaled Composite will support NASA in developing a sub-system level and Air Traffic Management (ATM) Simulations by supplying Vehicle & Air Vehicle Control Station (AVCS) models, (including Platform-Specific Aerodynamics, Flight Controls, and C3 modules) and by supporting integration of theses models into various laboratory and simulation environments.  Support will also include enumerating and providing available aero data, models, control laws, and comparison data such as time histories. The payload will be integrated with the airplane at the contractor’s facility in Mojave, CA.   NASA/DFRC intends to contract for these services directly from Scaled Composites, LLC, Mojave, CA under the terms and conditions of BPA No. E05479D.  The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements”. Justification is based upon Scaled Composites, LLC's unique and proprietary capabilities to provide the required services involving both the Proteus Aircraft and the aircraft’s support structure for the installation of the GFE CCA subsystem (TCAS-II and ADS-B, which will typically employ ARINC 429, Mil-Std 1553, RS-232, RS-422, or similar data protocols) to include Aircraft and AVCS hardware components and software modules.  The Proteus is a one-of-a-kind aircraft that was designed and manufactured by Scaled Composites, LLC.	Additionally, the Proteus is the only existing aircraft that offers the payload, performance, surrogate UAV features, and endurance capabilities necessary to meet the requirements of the High Altitude requirements.	Award to any other source would result in failure to meet the Agency's requirements.	The Government intends to acquire these commercial services using FAR Part 12.  Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform this effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on April 22, 2005.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required.

<DESC>Proposals will be accepted from all business concerns for the DC PLH-14(3) Interstate 395 Signing Improvements Project.  Project documents will be available on or about April 22, 2005.  Proposals will be due on or about May 23, 2005 at the EFLHD in Sterling, Virginia.  Use internet address http://www2.efl.fhwa.dot.gov/Documents.aspx to check for availability of project documents.  All documents can be directly downloaded from this website.  Documents will no longer be mailed.  Register to receive e-mail notification to automatically be notified when a document is added or updated for a specific project.

This project consists of correcting signage deficiencies on Interstate 395 (I-395), between the DC Jurisdictional Line on the 14th Street Bridge and New York Avenue, Washington, DC.  The primary project limits on I-395 in the 14th Street Bridge Corridor extend from the DC Jurisdictional line to Maine Avenue; and consists of installation, modification, removal and replacement of traffic signs (roadside and overhead), cantilever sign structures, and overhead sign bridges to meet the current standards and principles of the MUTCD for enhancing the safety of the traveling public.  Electrical connections, including conduit and wiring, will be needed at all new sign structure locations.  The secondary project limits on I-395 extend from Maine Avenue to New York Avenue and addresses over-height vehicle signing, for vehicles approaching and traveling in the National Mall tunnel.  Again these signs are proposed to meet the current standards and principles of the MUTCD.  Traffic control will be very important during construction of this project, and will most likely include night work.

The project is expected to fall within the price range of $1,000,000 to $5,000,000. 

Award will be made to an offeror whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the technical qualifications and price that offers the best value to the Government.  Offerors are reminded that while the Government may elect to consider data obtained from other sources, the burden of proof of acceptability rests with the offeror.     

Questions can be emailed to eflhd.contracts@fhwa.dot.gov.  Requests must include the solicitation number, project name and number, requesting firm and address, a point of contact and telephone number.

PLEASE NOTE
Background and Evaluation Criteria:  The Government will award to the lowest priced/technically acceptable responsible offeror.  The Contracting Officer will evaluate all proposals for technical acceptability. 

Note: Competing technical proposals will be evaluated against the solicitation requirements; they are not compared with each other. The technical factor described below will be rated on a pass/fail basis, and it must receive a passing score for an offeror's proposal to receive further consideration. Evaluating each responsive proposal and comparing the results of that evaluation against the technical requirements specified in this solicitation will determine technical acceptability.

Request for Proposal (RFP) Submittals:  Interested firms/teams will submit a proposal that is based on the evaluation criteria established in this notice.  Please submit pricing information in a separate envelope.


 
JOINT VENTURE (J/V) DOCUMENTATION HAS TO BE COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED PRIOR TO CONTRACT AWARD.

Evaluation Factors/Criteria:

Special Note:  Price and all technical factors are equal.  (50% Price and 50% technical)

(1) Price 
     
(2) Past performance, experience and technical competence:  List and describe 3 recent projects indicating past performance, experience and technical competence in similar signing projects.  In addition, provide a customer/owner point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address if available.  Within the last ten years, has your firm ever been, or proposed to be, suspended, debarred, or determined non-responsible, based upon an allegation of unsatisfactory performance or fraud? Within the last ten years, has your firm ever had a contract terminated for any reason either as a prime or subcontractor?  This also applies to a partner in a joint venture. Within the last ten years, has your firm ever filed a claim relative to the construction of a roadway facility for (1) a default termination, (2) the imposition of liquidated damages, (3) a termination for convenience that adversely affected your firm, or (4) any damages caused by the owners determination that you did not perform in a timely, safe, or contractual manner.

The Government will review and evaluate each firm’s (offeror) documented past performance and will rate them as acceptable or unacceptable.  By acceptable past performance, the Government means that the offeror has a good reputation for satisfying its customers and delivering quality work in a timely manner at a reasonable cost.  Acceptable past performance also means the firm has a reputation of integrity, reasonable and cooperative conduct, and commitment to customer satisfaction.  In reviewing and evaluating an offeror’s past performance, the Government will consider information obtained from the firm, and may consider information obtained from other sources.  This includes past and present customers and their current and former employees, past and present subcontractors and their current and former employees, current and former employees of the firm, federal, state and local government agencies (including court records), and private consumer protection organizations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to provide information on problems encountered on identified contracts and annotate the firm’s corrective action taken.  The Government will evaluate past performance information and will rate the firms as pass or fail.  In the event that a firm does not have a record of relevant past performance, or information on past performance is not available, the firm will not be evaluated favorable or unfavorably on this technical evaluation factor.  Rather the offeror will be given a neutral rating. 

In accordance with FAR clause 252.215-1, Instructions to Offerors-Competitive Acquisition (MAR 2001), the Government will award after evaluations are completed, unless the Contracting Officer determines that discussions are necessary.

Due to changes in the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) that adds the Annual Representations and Certifications FAR 52.204-8 (Jan 2005), the Representations and Certifications must be filled-in online at http://orca.bpn.gov/.  The required Annual Form Vets-100 must also be filled-in online at http://vets100.cudenver.edu  per FAR 52.222-37.     Contractors are not eligible for award unless these requirements are satisfied.

<CONTACT>Linda Stein, Contract Specialist, Phone 757-441-6573, Fax 757-441-3786, Email Linda.C.Stein@noaa.gov
<DESC>This announcement modifies the synopsis to Solicitation EA133M-05-RP-1109 to change the Base Line Items and include Option Line Items.  The contract will have one  base line item for the Design of the Tail Doppler Radar System (Phase I) and option line items to include  the construction, integration and system testing (Phase II), one G-IV Ground Doppler Radar System,  engineering change orders, spares, repair parts and ground support equipment.
Anticipated release date of solicitation is changed from on or about April 1, 2005 to on or about April 21, 2005. 






The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) at MacDill Air Force Base (AFB), FL, has a requirement for a tail-mounted scanning dual-beam X-band research radar system to be used on the NOAA Gulfstream G-IVSP aircraft. NOAA presently anticipates award of a fixed price contract no later than September 2005.  The contract will have a design phase with Preliminary and Critical Design Reviews, followed by a construction and installation phase.  The contract may also require the contractor to use earned value measurement and cost performance monitoring (EVM/CPM).

The Doppler radar system will be used to obtain detailed wind field information for initialization of the National Weather Service (NWS) Hurricane Weather and Research Forecast (HWRF) model.  The Doppler weather radar system shall have the following characteristics:  (1) reflectivity accuracy of ~1dBZ; (2) a radial velocity accuracy of ~1m/s; (3) a vertical resolution of 1 km; (4) a maximum horizontal unambiguous range of at least 50 km; (5) a maximum  rotational rate of at least 10 rpm (60 degrees/sec) to provide target horizontal (along-track) data spacing resolution of no more than 1.5km; (6) a maximum sampled gate length of 150 m; and (7) a total space displacement that permits it to fit within a new tail radome approximately 39 inches in diameter.  The Doppler radar system will interface with a data path and quality control system currently under development by NOAA.  In addition, a Government-provided stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) must be incorporated into the new tail radome enclosure.  The aircraft is FAA certified and maintains a valid airworthiness certificate.  The installation of the tail radar unit will involve physical modification of the aircraft that will affect its flight characteristics and weight balance.  Such modifications must be accomplished in conformance with the original equipment manufacture’s flight envelope specifications and must comply with FAA certification requirements for the specific aircraft type and mode of operation.  The modified G-IV aircraft is required to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations in the Code Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14, Part 25, 14 CFR Part 36 and 14 CFR Part 91.  The original equipment manufacturer has retained most rights in data for the aircraft.  Performance of this work must be accomplished so as to have as little impact as possible on availability of the G-IV aircraft to perform mandated hurricane, winter storm and other meteorological reconnaissance and research.  Windows of availability of the aircraft for modification and testing exist for 2-3 months in the late Spring and 1-2 months in late Fall of each year.  Delivery of the complete tail radar installation is required not later than July 2007.  This requirement will provide for data collection and characterization by NOAA during the 2007 hurricane season, with full system certification and operational use in the 2008 hurricane season.  NOAA anticipates establishment of a ground mockup system at AOC in order to facilitate Doppler radar system testing and integration with the SFMR and data collection systems.  

In order to ensure that small businesses have a fair opportunity to participate in this acquisition, NOAA will use the Small Business Cascading Evaluation Preference Process.  This cascading set-aside preference provision is included in this Request for Proposals to notify large businesses that, if a sufficient number of eligible small businesses submit highly qualified offers; large businesses may not be considered for award.  The Government reserves the right to make either a full set-aside award or a partial set-aside award depending on the number and acceptability of responses received from small businesses in the evaluation.  The Department of Commerce (DOC) requires that all contractors doing business with Government be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Award cannot be made to a company not registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR, please access the following web site:  www.ccr.gov.  In order to register, all offerors must have a Dun and Bradstreet (D&B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) identifier.  A DUNS number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at www.dnb.com/product/eupdate, or by phone at (800) 333-0505.  The solicitation, notice and all amendments will be posted and available for viewing and downloading on the Government Electronic Posting System (FedBizOpps) site at www.fedbizzzopps.gov. No paper copies will be issued.  No telephone, facsimile or written requests will be accepted.  When the solicitation is posted, it is incumbent upon the interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents.  The solicitation will be issued on or about April 1, 2004.    Interested businesses are asked to notify the contracting officer that they have downloaded the solicitation via e-mail.

Is Cost Sharing Required:  Yes, this RFP is offering financial assistance funding only.  


Funding Opportunity Description:  

The Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program (WHIP) is a voluntary conservation program that promotes wildlife habitat and environmental quality.  WHIP assists landowners in maintaining and/or enhancing these habitats while protecting natural resources.  

WHIP funds in Oregon for FY05 will be used to fund projects / proposals for the protection and enhancement of habitats for declining populations of species of concern, including state and federal threatened and endangered species on agricultural lands.   

The FY05 WHIP financial assistance funds will be managed as listed: 
•	Distribution goal is 15% tribal and 85% non-tribal.  Adjustments will be made if the goal cannot be met.
•	Will be awarded in a statewide competition consistent with the FY05 Oregon WHIP priorities.
•	At least $180,000 of the WHIP-FA will fund salmonid habitat restoration and enhancement proposals. 
•	Per proposal maximum cap of $150,000.

FY05 Oregon habitat priorities are sage grouse habitat, salmonid habitat and “other at-risk species and habitats”.  Oregon NRCS is requesting proposals for the following priorities listed below: 

1.	FY05 Oregon WHIP Sage Grouse Habitat Priority:

The FY05 OR WHIP priorities for sage grouse habitat conservation, restoration and enhancement proposals are those proposing:

•	Sage grouse habitat conservation and improvement projects on private lands for maintaining current populations through maintenance and enhancement of sage grouse habitat.  The primary habitats of emphasis are Sage Grouse in their current range, located in Baker, Crook, Deschutes, and Lake Counties. Proposals for other counties within the current range will be considered if habitat is in danger of being converted or lost. The current range areas for those counties are shown on the attached map from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Greater Sage-Grouse Conservation Assessment and Strategy for Oregon, dated Dec 30, 2004.

•	Emphasis will be on proposals with existing partnership/planning efforts seeking to implement plans/projects for improving sage grouse habitats.  Such efforts are currently being developed in Baker, Deschutes, Crook and Lake Counties.  Proposals are to be based on the biological needs of sage-grouse and the conservation and improvement of their habitats. 

2.	FY05 WHIP Salmon Habitat Priority:

The FY05 OR WHIP priorities for salmonid habitat restoration and enhancement proposals are those proposing:

•	Salmonid habitat improvement projects that directly benefit the health of salmonid habitats through conservation actions in upland and related riparian areas.   The proposals must be located in relation to “small streams” (i.e., second to fourth order streams) with recognized critical areas and show benefits directly for salmon habitats. These projects may, for example, include plantings (herbaceous, woody), increased buffer size, livestock exclusion, off-stream livestock/wildlife watering, fencing, and plantings. Upland improvements may involve, for example, juniper-clearing, range planting, etc. that benefits the health of riparian areas, water quantity and quality. 

•	Streambank restoration projects in areas that show benefits directly for salmon habitats will be considered provided project design and implementation is covered by a programmatic consultation, such as the Corp of Engineer’s biological opinion for Standard Local Operating Procedures for Endangered Species (SLOPES) or consultation is done by a third party.   

3.	FY05 WHIP Other At-Risk Species and Habitats Priority:

•	The FY05 OR WHIP priorities for “Other At-Risk Species and Habitats” restoration and enhancement proposals are those addressing:

•	Essential plant and animal habitats designated under federal or state law and locations of listed or candidate species that can be improved or particularly rare and unique habitats that could support at-risk species.  The “Other At-Risk Species and Habitats” proposals are to address these habitats with respect to agricultural lands.  Suggested habitats are native and wet prairie, grasslands, oak woodlands and savanna, and shrub-steppe habitats.  

The selected WHIP proposals will be funded through cooperative agreements. A cooperative agreement will be entered into between the United States Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service, (NRCS); and the selected partner.  This cooperative agreement assists both NRCS and the partner with the implementation of common objectives and mutual interests in restoring and protecting fish and wildlife habitat within the state of Oregon. In the agreement NRCS and partner agree to combine their resources to ensure that wildlife habitat in the State of Oregon is restored and maintained.

Upon execution of this agreement, NRCS shall obligate WHIP funds for the implementation of wildlife habitat activities. This cooperative agreement is the authorizing document to obligate NRCS funds for habitat development activities as proposed in the selected WHIP proposals.   Each selected proposal will result in WHIP contracts with the respective landowners.  WHIP contracts are generally 5 to 10 year agreements to provide restoration cost share funding at a 75% federal cost share payment.  

NRCS will provide the partner with sufficient information to perform the tasks outlined in this agreement.   Specifically, NRCS will provide technical and other assistance required to develop and implement wildlife habitat development plans under this cooperative agreement.  NRCS will also provide training and information to partners as it deems necessary to ensure program requirements are performed in accordance with current up-to-date information. NRCS will review the development of an O&M agreement in accordance with WHIP regulations and policies for the project prior to performance of work or award of a contract for which NRCS will provide reimbursement under this agreement.  The applicant shall report to NRCS the appropriate data elements associated with the technical services provided to the Department or program participant so that the data can be entered into the conservation accomplishment tracking system.

Partner will design treatments to create the conditions necessary to develop and maintain the habitat functions of the project area.  This assistance will include activities associated with developing the preliminary and final Wildlife Habitat Development Plans (WHDP) addressing the participant's identified wildlife resource needs.  The WHDP will be developed in accordance with WHIP regulations, policies, and NRCS Field Office Technical Guide (FOTG) standards.  The plan must contain all conservation practices needed to meet FOTG Quality Criteria for conservation management systems and National Planning Procedures Handbook (NPPH) planning policy specifically as it relates to the participant's wildlife resources.  Practices approved for cost share in FY2005 are identified in Attachment 1. All WHIP agreements and contracts shall be entered and recorded in Protracts with SCIMS information, AD 1155 denoting practices, number of units, cost share rate and total obligation.  As well, progress shall be recorded in the NRCS Progress Reporting System.

Procedures for Applying for Assistance:

The prioritization and funding of proposals will be completed in the following manner:

•	Applicant must submit one original and two (2) copies of their proposal to Chris Martin, Contract Specialist, USDA, NRCS 101 SW Main, Ste 1300; Portland, Oregon 97204
•	A budget is required for each proposal.
•	Applicants are encouraged to visit with NRCS at the respective local USDA Service Center to discuss local wildlife habitat concerns and priorities. 
•	Eligible projects must be voluntary efforts that benefit species or their habitat on lands controlled by private landowners, state and local governmental entities, or Tribes.  
•	Projects in partnership with other persons or entities are a higher funding priority.  
•	Proposals will be competitively ranked and selected based on a point system consistent with FY05 Oregon State Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program (WHIP) Ranking Criteria (attached).
•	NRCS will select the proposals to be funded.
•	WHIP participants are required to be in compliance with the conservation provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, in order to receive WHIP cost-share payments. Therefore, WHIP participants who do not participate in other USDA programs will be required to complete an AD-1026 and comply with the Highly Erodible Land Conservation / Wetland Conservation provisions. WHIP applicants who need to complete an AD-1026 should contact the respective Farm Service Agency office.

Available Funding:

•	Oregon NRCS is offering approximately $600,000 of FY05 WHIP financial assistance funds.   Funding amount is subject to change.  Any additional funding received in Oregon will be added to this announcement.

Authority:  

•	Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, P.L. 107-171; Federal Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, P. L. 104-127; Food Security Act of 1985, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 3830 et seq.

NOTICE:  THE RESPONSE DUE DATE IS HEREBY EXTENED TO APRIL 22, 2005..........
RFI eAuthentication Path Discovery and Validation 

..INTRODUCTION: The E-Authentication Initiative (EAI) has identified the need for products and services to perform certificate path discovery and validation in compliance with Federal government requirements.  The intent of this Request for Information (RFI) is to invite the vendor community to share their capabilities in this area with the Federal government.  

The Federal Public Key Infrastructure (FPKI) is constructed as a bridge-enabled environment.  The EAI acknowledges that commercially available products capable of performing path discovery and path validation in a bridge-enabled environment may be very limited.  Thus, the intent of this RFI is to query the vendor community to determine the state of available products and their ability to implement any or all of the functional requirements described in Section 4 of this document.

..SCOPE: The RFI document specifies the functional requirements for certificate path discovery and validation used in cross-domain environment.  Section 2 of the document describes the EAI’s general approach to identify appropriate products and services.  Section 3 provides background information on the cross-domain environment in which these products and services will operate.  Functional requirements are specified for path discovery, path validation, delegated path validation, auditing, and hosted services in Section 4.  Three basic scenarios for implementing these requirements are considered: all functionality may be performed locally; all functionality may be performed remotely by a hosted service; or, functionality may be shared between a local capability and a remote hosted service.  Auditing may be handled by the same component that performs path discovery and validation, or may be left to each PKI-enabled application.  Related expectations for performance metrics are specified in Section 5.

..GENERAL APPROACH: Section 4 of the RFI document describes the functional requirements for performing certificate validation for certificate-based applications utilizing the FPKI.  While the Government's ultimate goal is to acquire products/services that fully meet these requirements, we acknowledge that products/services available today may not fully address these requirements.  Therefore, we are interested in determining the state of industry, and subsequently working with vendors whose products most closely meet these requirements.
The Government is seeking information on two general approaches for certification validation: local validation products and hosted validation services.  Local validation products are co-located with the relying application.  Hosted validation services are services provided by the vendor that perform the certificate validation, and interface to the relying application to provide certificate validation results.  Applications may include web-based applications running on web servers (e.g., Apache, Microsoft IIS, etc.), and desktop applications (e.g., Microsoft Outlook, Adobe Acrobat, etc.). Vendors are asked to review the set of functional requirements described within the RFI Section 4.  Vendors are then asked to provide a response for each capability, indicating whether or not their respective product/service implements this capability.  Appendix A of the RFI provides the template to be used for all responses.  Multiple templates should be used for multiple product responses.
Responses will be reviewed, and products and services best meeting the needs of the EAI will be invited for testing in the E-Authentication Interoperability Lab.  Testing will begin April 25, 2005.  At the conclusion of this testing, products and services determined to be acceptable may be entered onto a list of qualified and preferred vendors for use by federal agencies implementing certificate-based E-Authentication solutions.  This list will be released to the public no later than June 30, 2005.

..HOW TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE RFI:  If your firm is interested in participating in this ambitious project, then submit your request for a copy of the RFI eAuthentication Path Discovery and Validation Products and Services document to pathval2@cam.mitretek.org.

<DESC>This requirement is for the fabrication and build of one (1) Alternative Monochromator Drum Assembly in accordance with NIST drawings which shall be provided to the Contractor.

This drum consists of heavy steel shot (several tons) and paraffin filled components that have to be welded together followed by machining to very tight tolerances. The function of the drum is to house a neutron monochromator and prevent all but a small fraction of the radiation scattering from the monochromator to be shielded away from the environment in which these drums are deployed.  

The design for the monochromator drum shall be a part of the Statement of Work as a set of drawings and procedures.  The specific objective of this requirement is to have one monochromator drum as defined by those drawings and procedures as well as a replacement support column that can, in principle, turn the monochromator into its functional mirror image.

This requirement is being procured via full & open competition under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.

The NAICS code for this requirement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The competitive Request for Proposal (RFP), specifications, RFP amendments, and all questions and answers related to this procurement shall be made available via the Internet at HTTP://WWW.FEDBIZOPPS.GOV under RFP number SB1341-05-R-0005.

The RFP has been released effective April 14, 2005.  It is only
only available via the Internet at the above web site.

Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the web site.  Interested parties must respond to the RFP in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.   

No written solicitation document is available, telephone requests shall not be honored, and no bidders list shall be maintained.  Potential offerors are requested to direct all questions via e-mail to Carol.Wood@NIST.Gov.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA209), is conducting a market survey seeking other government agencies, industry, academia, nonprofits, and Federal Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) partners for information to aid in the planning of future technologies to integrate into the U.S. Navy’s Terrain Awareness Warning Systems (TAWS) (DTED based) for use in rotary wing and tilt rotor aircraft. This is a Request for Information (RFI) only.  This is not a Request for Proposal or an indication that the Navy will contract for these supplies/services.  The Navy will not pay for information received in response to this RFI.  

Detailed Description: 

Specifically, the U.S. Navy seeks to ascertain information relative to current and/or future TAWS enhancing capabilities. TAWS will be used to provide an increased level of protection against Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT) for its rotary wing and tilt rotor aircraft during flight over varying terrain and Nap of the Earth (NOE) flight, where terrain along the future flight path of the aircraft is as important as that directly beneath the aircraft. Platforms targeted for this system include the MH-60R/S, H-1, and the tilt rotor V-22.  

Limitations inherent in the basic Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) currently deployed in Navy/Marine Corps rotary wing aircraft result in areas of reduced or no protection against CFITs, particularly against flight into rising terrain.  The Navy’s tactical TAWS was developed to provide additional forward-looking predictive capabilities and enhance protection against CFIT provided by the basic GPWS.  The Navy’s TAWS is a software solution tailorable to multiple Navy/Marine Corps platforms.  The Navy is looking to enhance its existing TAWS (DTED Level 1 based) by including “look-ahead” capability for ground and/or obstacle detection in low level flight.  Due to weight and space limitations on most Navy/Marine Corps rotary wing platforms, a software enhancement to TAWS possibly utilizing existing sensors is preferred, however both software and hardware solutions will be considered.  

Interested sources should identify challenges relative to their solution and describe how those challenges will be approached.  For example, TAWS that utilize Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) Level 1 encounter challenges with data resolution since most helicopters maneuver in distances that are inside the current resolution limits of the digital data.  The information submitted on currently available or planned systems must describe what integration is required to implement the system onboard the targeted platforms, and how it would impact the electrical, weight, space, power, environmental conditions, and processing parameters of the platform. Describe in sufficient detail the supportability requirements of the system such as: maintenance concept (including built-in-test (BIT) capabilities), support equipment, supply and computer resources support, and training. Provide demonstrated Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) figures for existing systems as well as predicted MTBFs for future systems.  Provide a notional delivery schedule for systems currently available and/or anticipated time frames for proposed systems.  

RFI Response Requirement:  

Based upon the above detailed description and basic requirement, the U.S. Navy requests interested sources to provide responses to the additional specific questions:
 
1)	What type of objects would be detected (size and range)?  
2)	For detected objects, what is the accuracy (size and range)?  
3)	Can the system be commanded by TAWS to scan a specific range and bearing?  
4)	What type of information is provided back to TAWS?
5)	What is the Rough Order of Magnitude cost of any existing system and/or planned system that may provide TAWS enhancing capability in low-level flight as outlined above?
6)	What is the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for the proposed idea or technology?

The page limitation is requested to only 15 pages in order to effectively review each RFI response.   Interested parties should provide responses with product/service specifications no later than 60 days from the date of this notice. All information received in response to this announcement will be kept confidential.  Additional information on the TAWS Program is provided at the following web site:
http://pma209.navair.navy.mil/teams/navigation/gpws/home.asp
 
This RFI does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NAVAIR to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) that will be reviewed will provide (at no cost to NAVAIR) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the RFI. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience consistent with the efforts synopsized for the specified NAVAIR proposal. 

All RFI responses should be sent to: The Naval Air Systems Command, Attn: Paula Jackson, 47123 Buse Road, Unit IPT, Bldg. 2272, Suite 350, Patuxent River, MD   20670-1547. 

The preferred method of submission is via email to: Paula.Jackson@navy.mil. E-mail your technical questions to Tom Anderson at:Thomas.E.Anderson@navy.mil. The due date for submission is COB 14 JUNE 2005 (60 days from date of notice).

<DESC>This is a “Request for Information (RFI) issued by the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), Glynco, GA for the purpose of conducting market research on distributed or web-based applications that will be used by the FLETC to administer the organization’s accreditation process.  Funding is not available at this time, but the FLETC Accreditation office wishes to obtain information for the purpose of identifying applications or systems that have the capability of automatically tracking an accreditation process. 

The FLETC has over eighty (80) Partner Organizations, of which twenty-five (25) maintain individual law enforcement academies, such as United States Secret Service, Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and United States Marshals at FLETC’s training sites. Therefore, the accreditation process will need to be viewed via individual or academy specific requirements/standards.  Furthermore, the system should be able to store, retrieve, sort, query and generate reports for the purpose of tracking the organization’s progress towards accreditation. 

The system’s reporting requirements should include at a minimum, tracking and reporting standards that are in compliance, non-compliance, have waivers, or require corrective action before accreditation can be awarded. The law enforcement accreditation process requires reaccreditation every three years post the initial accreditation, therefore the system must be able to identify, track, and report those programs requiring re-accreditation.

Descriptive literature and/or websites should be provided concerning the product.

FUNDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROCUREMENT AND THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Send information to DHS, FLETC, 1131 Chapel Crossing Road, ATTN:  Cynthia D. Bartosh, Procurement Division, Building 93, Glynco, GA  31524.

<DESC>The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) desires the acquisition of a multi-purpose warhead for use on the 2.75 inch hydra rockets fired from SOF aviation platforms.   The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) intends to apply for approval of a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) project (www.acq.osd.mil/sts/fct) to qualify a multi-purpose warhead that is more effective against an array of targets to include buildings, bunkers and ships.   (1)  Penetration:  When mounted on a MK66 rocket motor and fired, the warhead will penetrate 24” of reinforced concrete and 4’ of timber/earthen bunkers.   (2)  Non-Developmental / In Service Status:  The multi-purpose warhead must be non-developmental and qualified by other allied (NATO) countries.  (3)  Mass/CG Flight Characteristics:  When mounted on a Hydra rocket motor, the warhead will have a similar mass and center of gravity when compared to the M229/M151 warhead to insure that no need to change supporting fire control instrumentation (weapon racks) or effect ongoing spiral developments (precision kill weapon system).  (4)  Incendiary Effect:  The multi-purpose warhead must provide an incendiary effect to create secondary fires after impact.  (5)  Training Warhead:  It is desired that the vendor provide an inert day/night warhead (to replace the M274) warhead that provides a visible hit signature.  The new warhead should not create UXO hazards. When deployed overseas, the new warhead should allowing SOF forces to conduct training on allied ranges without creating UXO hazards or creating in-advertent range fires.   (6)  Facilities, Expertise and Safety:    These warheads should meet stringent Navy WSRB requirements/standards.  All the cartridges should provide for reduced reaction from outside stimuli (IM characteristics) and provide for good performance after undergoing storage in various environments. ** Responses to this market survey are due on or before 15 APRIL 2004, and must include a product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for the price of test articles and production units.  This synopsis does not constitute an Invitation for Bid or Request for Proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Interested Parties should reply by submitting a White Paper no later than 15 APRIL 2004.    Questions may be submitted in writing to LTC Wil Riggins at the above address or via email to riggind@socom.mil. Interested Parties who are willing to provide qualified cartridges at no cost for USSOCOM testing should so indicate in the submitted white paper. No further information is available from the contracting office.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, PM Light Tactical Vehicle (PM LTV)  Office Warren, MI  is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey due 28 April 05.  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This market survey is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by TACOM-Warren.  PM Tactical Vehicles is interested in pursuing a replacement occupant restraint system for the current seats in HMMWVs, and in other ta ctical (wheeled) vehicles.  The major issues with the current restraint systems are:  (1) The seat belts get caught on a soldiers gear when released (2) The ends of the belts are difficult to locate quickly. Other issues with the current systems are: (1) Some seat belts are too short (2) Sometimes the belt retractors jam and lock.  An offeror should strongly consider the ease of application of its system to existing (fielded) HMMWVs, and to other tactical vehicles.  The offeror must: (1) Provide a clear, c omplete, and specific description of its experience in designing, developing, and testing occupant restraint systems(2) Provide a clear, complete, and specific description of its experience in manufacturing occupant restraint systems.  Please indicate the quantities of systems/components produced, and the timeframes for production.  The proposed occupant restraint system for HMMWVs and other tactical vehicles shall: Be more user-friendly than the current system, so that the user is more likely to use it (ea sy to find, easy to engage, doesn't get caught in the door, long enough to cover 95th male with body armor, uniform and gear). Be easy to exit the seat and vehicle (restraint system doesn't hang up on gear, and allows the occupant in full gear to rapidly e xit the restraint system and the seat).  Have a single-point, quick-release. Be a three, four or five point system, and may use existing mount points in vehicles, if feasible.  Provide restraint in all seating locations (4 max per vehicle).  Provide restra int in all variants of HMMWVs (including up-armored and add-on-armor HMMWVs), and other tactical vehicles.  Conform to needed FMVSS, such as 207, 208 and 210. Conform to MIL-STD-1472.  Be useable in Highway and Off-Road applications. Deliverables: Info pap er due 28 April 05 to include the following:  Cost estimate and delivery schedule for orders of 500 & 10,000 vehicle sets (4 systems per set).  Specifications such as weight, performance and ease of installation on existing (fielded) HMMWVs, and other tact ical vehicles.  Results of testing or certifications.  Equipment currently outfitted with similar restraints.  Familiarity with HMMWVs, and other tactical vehicles.  Name, address, phone number, CAGE code, and POC.  The restraint style, model number, name,  etc.  Prototype hardware demonstrated by 29 April 05.  Information provided by an offeror is for the Government's assessment of occupant restraint systems and components that may meet the Government's needs.  It is the Government's intent to share the inf ormation provided with ARCCA, Inc., and AM General, L.L.C.  ARCCA is the Government's consultant for safety, and does not manufacture occupant restraint systems or components.  AM General is the Government's consultant for integrating systems and component s into the HMMWV Family of vehicles.  Information that an offeror submits wil be made available to ARCCA for Safety evaluation and AM General for integration evaluation.  If an offeror chooses to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with ARCCA or AM Gener al, they should independently take steps to make that happen.  If a non-disclosure agreement is entered into, please inform us so we can take measures to safe guard the data accordingly.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, PM Light Tactical Vehicle (PM LTV) Office Warren, MI is conducting a Sources Sought Market Survey due 28 April 05.  This is NOT an Invitation for Bid (IFB) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  This ma rket survey is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by TACOM-Warren.  PM Tactical Vehicles is interested in pursuing a new vehicle seat & restraint system applicable to HMMWVs, and to other tactical (wheeled ) vehicles.  The major issues with the current seat and restraint systems are:  (1) The seat belts get caught on a soldiers gear when released.  (2) The ends of the belts are difficult to locate quickly.  Other issues with the current systems are: (1) Some seat belts are too short. (2) Sometimes the belt retractors jam and lock.  The proposed system shall be a three, four or five point system, and may use existing mount points in vehicles, if feasible.  An offeror should strongly consider the ease of application of its system to existing (fielded) HMMWVs, and to other tactical vehicles.  The offeror must: (1) Provide a clear, complete, and specific description of its experience in designing, developing, and testing occupant restraint systems. (2) Provide a clear, complete, and specific description of its experience in manufacturing occupant restraint systems.  Please indicate the quantities of system s/components produced, and the timeframes for production.  The proposed seat and restraint system for HMMWVs and other tactical vehicles shall:  Be more user-friendly than the current system, so that the user is more likely to use it (easy to find, easy to  engage, doesn't get caught in the door, long enough to cover 95th male with body armor, uniform and gear).  Be easy to exit the seat and vehicle (restraint system doesn't hang up on gear, and allows the occupant in full gear to rapidly exit the restraint system and the seat).  Have a single-point, quick-release.  Be a three, four or five point restraint system, and may be integrated into the seat, or structurally-mounted to the vehicle.  Not require mine blast protection, but provisions/modularity in the d esign should allow for mine blast protection in the near future.  Be applicable to all four seating locations.  Provide restraint in all variants of HMMWVs (including add-on-armor HMMWVs, but initially excluding up-armored HMMWVs), and other tactical vehic les. Conform to needed FMVSS, such as 207, 208 and 210.  Conform to MIL-STD-1472. Be useable in Highway and Off-Road applications  Deliverables:  Info paper due 28 April 05 to include the following:  Cost estimate and availability of orders of 500 & 10,000 vehicle sets (4 systems per set).  Specifications such as weight, performance and  ease of installation on existing (fielded) HMMWVs, and other tactical vehicles.  Results of testing or certifications.  Familiarity with HMMWVs, and other tactical vehicles.  Equipment currently outfitted with similar restraints. Name, address, phone number, CAGE code, and POC.  The restraint style, model number, name, etc.  Prototype hardware demonstrated by 29 April 05.  Information provided by an offeror is for the Governments assessment of occupant restraint systems and compon ents that may meet the Governments needs.  It is the Governments intent to share the information provided with ARCCA, Inc., and AM General, L.L.C.  ARCCA is the Governments consultant for safety, and does not manufacture occupant restraint systems or co mponents.  AM General is the Governments consultant for integrating systems and components into the HMMWV Family of vehicles.  Information that an offeror submits will be made available to ARCCA for Safety evaluation and AM General for integration evaluat ion.  If an offeror chooses to enter into a non-disclosure agreement with ARCCA or AM General, they should independently take steps to make that happen.  If a non-disclosure agreement is entered into, please i nform us so we can take measures to safe guard the data accordingly.  If we have not received a copy of the non-disclosure agreement, or notice of intent to obtain one by the closing date of this Market Survey, the data will be released as indicated above. ARCCAs address is 2288 Second Street Pike, P.O. Box 78, Penns Park, PA   18943-0078.  A point-of-contact at ARCCA is Gary Whitman, (215) 598-9750, gwhitman@arcca.com.

<SUBJECT>B -- Mobility Applications For Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (MVII) Initiative; RFI
<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION	
Federal Highway Administration
MOBILITY APPLICATIONS FOR VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE INTEGRATION INITIATIVE; REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
AGENCIES: Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), USDOT.
ACTION: Notice; Request For Information.
SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) is seeking information from all sources for its Mobility Applications for Vehicle Infrastructure Integration (MVII) initiative. This is a Request For Information only. This is NOT a Request For Applications (RFA) or a Request For Proposals (RFP). The MVII initiative is one of the six exploratory initiatives recently launched by the USDOT’s Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) program to improve transportation safety, and enhance mobility and productivity.
	The purpose of this exploratory initiative is to investigate the methods, tools, and techniques that would be enabled by VII technologies and would provide significant mobility benefits to the traveling public.  The underlying VII technologies themselves are the subject of another initiative.  The USDOT’s vision is that travelers will see significant improvements in personal mobility, and metropolitan areas will realize significant improvements in the efficient movement of people and goods, through the introduction of mobility applications enabled by VII.  The goals of the MVII exploratory initiative are to evaluate the mobility benefits of methods, tools, and techniques that would be enabled by a modest to moderate deployment of VII technology, and to accelerate the deployment of applications with highest mobility benefit.  
	The MVII exploratory initiative will identify and close key knowledge gaps with regards to mobility benefits of MVII-enabled methods, tools, and techniques. The exploratory initiative will demonstrate through research, simulations, test track demonstrations, human factors research, and limited prototype testing how VII technologies can be used efficiently and proactively to improve mobility for the traveling public.  The exploratory initiative will disseminate to the transportation community the information and tools needed to deploy such applications.  The objective of the proposed initiative is to accelerate deployment of VII-enabled mobility enhancements by demonstrating mobility benefits in a convincing evaluation using real world data.
OBJECTIVE:
	The objective of this RFI is to seek broad stakeholder input and interest on the vision, goals, and approach of the MVII Initiative and to identify and gather information on tried, existing, and potential methods, tools, and techniques and evaluation methods.  
Respondents to this RFI are requested to consider the service concepts described in the section titled “MVII SERVICE CONCEPTS” and to reply to the questions posed in the section titled “MVII APPROACH AND DEPLOYMENT ISSUES”.
The information will assist the USDOT in identifying which methods, tools, and techniques and evaluation methods should receive further research effort.  For methods, tools, and techniques (service concepts), the emphasis is on a medium (5-10 year) deployment horizon that would be achievable with a modest to moderate market penetration of VII equipment.  This deployment horizon is shown as Region 2 of Figure 2 described in the appended section entitled “THE PROMISE OF VII MOBILITY APPLICATIONS.”  The Government also is interested in longer-range applications that could see initial deployments in Region 2.  Methods, tools, and techniques that could easily be done now without VII technology and applications that would require significant VII market penetration for even an initial deployment are out of scope.  Methods, tools, and techniques that primarily yield safety benefits are out of scope; such benefits are already being explored through separate initiatives.  For evaluation methods, the emphasis is on methods that will effectively and unambiguously demonstrate mobility benefits (or the lack thereto) without requiring a large model deployment.  This is primarily a RESEARCH initiative.   
DATES: Responses to this announcement should be submitted on or before 60 days after the posted date of this RFI. See the "Supplementary Information" section for electronic access and filing addresses.
POINTS OF CONTACT: Robert Ferlis, (202) 493-3268.

THE PROMISE OF VII MOBILITY APPLICATIONS

The deployment of VII for both safety and mobility applications will hopefully provide increasing mobility benefits for individual travelers and reduce congestion across the system as a whole.  The benefits will (in theory) increase over time as VII coverage increases.  Consider the Figure 1 below.  The trend line rising diagonally in the figure represents the increasing penetration of the number of VII equipped vehicles over time.  
The X-axis represents the number of Road Side Units (RSUs) with which the VII-equipped vehicles interact.  Over time there will be an increase in both the number of VII-equipped vehicles and the number of RSU deployments, indicating also that over time vehicles will interact intelligently at first with specific facilities like signalized intersections and then with the broader transportation system.
Finally, the Y-axis indicates of the sophistication of strategy that is employed based upon the penetration of VII-equipped vehicles, the number of deployed RSUs, and the overall interconnectivity among vehicles and the transportation system.  
 
Figure 1: Mobility Opportunities Stemming from VII Vehicle Penetration

Overall this figure outlines the growth projection of VII deployment and the growth projection of the application sophistication that results for that deployment.  Our projected end-state encompasses full VII-vehicle penetration and full interconnectivity with the transportation system.  This end state is outside the scope of this current initiative, however.  This initiative establishes the base applications between the near future and that end state – the period in which partial deployment exists but the growing demands for mobility will require action.
The goal of MVII is the proactive management of transportation resources to maximize the individual traveler’s mobility.  There are three stages that can be considered in how individual mobility is enhanced through VII.  These three stages are depicted on Figure 2 below.


Region I describes the advent of VII deployment including services that could be deployed now, with current technology, although perhaps not with the full functionality envisioned in some research literature.  This area is out of scope of this initiative.  
Region II describes a state of with modest penetration of VII, realizing safety and mobility gains through the cooperative interaction among vehicles and the transportation facility.  At this stage the traveler is both more informed and further integrated with the performance of the system.  His/her mobility options are widened as the safety applications diminish the debilitating constraints of crashes and other spontaneous impediments to mobility.  
This state of relatively low VII penetration features services that could be viable with a relatively small market penetration of VII on-board units and roadside units.  These services typically also have limited safety implications, so communications coverage and reliability requirements are relatively modest.  Some of these services add or improve functionality of currently deployed ITS.
Region III describes the state with widespread deployment of VII.  This is out of scope of this RFI and this initiative.  In region 3, congestion mobility constraints of physical capacity are mitigated as fully as possible.  In this time frame, congestion solutions may consider services that either have high communications reliability requirements or require near-total market penetration to function effectively.  Most of these longer-range services involve vehicle operator assistance and have the potential to deliver dramatically improved functionality from existing levels of service.
MVII SERVICE CONCEPTS:  
DOT is currently considering roughly a dozen service concepts for this initiative.  These service concepts were selected as the ones that could be demonstrated with VII technology expected to be available in 2010 AND would be most likely to produce significant mobility benefits in the medium to long term.  These service concepts are briefly described below.
Assisted Lateral Control:  This service uses VII to provide lateral control of vehicle movement, allowing the vehicle to “track” the lane with greater precision and reliability than would be otherwise be possible.  From a mobility standpoint, this would reduce driver stress, reduce congestion caused by lane-departure accidents, and potentially permit the safe operation in narrower lanes (allowing more lanes to provided in an existing right-of-way).  In the transit context, assisted lateral control could be used to assist stopping precisely at bus stops (precision docking), improving speed and quality of service.  
Longitudinal Control/Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control:  Vehicles communicate with each other and with the infrastructure to control time gaps between vehicles.  This service provides driver stress reduction and possibly system level throughput improvements.   For trucks, the mobility benefit could be wireless truck “platoons”, reducing driver workload for the driver of the trailing truck, as well as reducing fuel usage.  For buses, the mobility benefit could include “virtual articulated bus”, allowing an agency to wirelessly couple buses on an as-needed basis.  This service could be employed in low-speed operation to reduce driver stress in congested stop-and-go traffic.  
Community Transit:  Transit vehicle automation is utilized to provide very frequent, reliable circulator service in suburban neighborhoods, providing service both between the neighborhood and transit hubs, and within the neighborhood between activity centers.  It may be deployed in conjunction with VII-enabled traveler information services.  It differs from the dual mode automated bus described below in that it primarily offers service within neighborhoods, and that it includes driverless transit vehicles.  The automated, frequent service reduces the need for parking at transit hubs and local activity centers, and reduces air pollution caused by short trips within the neighborhood.  
Dedicated Truckway or Busway:  This service uses a combination of longitudinal and/or lateral guidance technologies to assist vehicle movement in a dedicated lane.  The mobility benefit would be more reliable, faster travel for the vehicles in question, as well as congestion reduction benefits for SOV drivers remaining in non-dedicated lanes.
Dual Mode Automated Bus:  A transit bus operates with lateral and/or longitudinal control for part of a route, and is manually driven for the neighborhood street portion of the route.   This offers similar travel speed and reliability benefits to light rail transit, but without the need to transfer for the “last mile” service to suburban neighborhoods.  The mobility benefits include travel time and convenience of service.  This service could make frequent, high quality transit service from neighborhoods to the central business district cost-effective.  If the service increases transit ridership, it could improve mobility benefits for transit passengers while reducing congestion for SOV drivers.  
Full Assistance with Driver Vigilance:  Once longitudinal and lateral controls are available in a dedicated lane, full vehicle assistance is possible within that lane.  This service would not necessarily offer automated merge capability or system-level traffic smoothing, so driver vigilance would be required.  It could substantially improve throughput, depending upon the time gap and speed chosen.   This service would be in a single dedicated lane – the challenges of deploying vehicle operator assistance in multiple lanes are outside the scope of this initiative.   
Gap Creation for Merging:  When most cars have VII-enabled longitudinal control (adaptive cruise control), it should be possible for a car on the merge area or ramp to send a message to cars on the main road requesting that a safe gap for merging be created.  This should allow system-level traffic smoothing, offering mobility benefits for all.  
Individualized Traffic Flow Encouragement:  VII is used to send traffic flow advice messages to individual vehicles, smoothing overall traffic flow and improving mobility for all.  We envision that this service will first be deployed in a dedicated lane as an opt-in service.  The messages sent could include “please accelerate briskly, the traffic jam is ending”, “stop tailgating”, “slow down to match speed of traffic”, or “caution – icy road ahead.”  The mobility benefits would be generally smoother traffic flow and possibly reduced congestion.  
Intelligent Speed Advisory and Control: VII is used to provide variable speed limits in work zones and school zones, as well as during inclement weather.  The VII is used to provide the speed limit directly to the vehicle.   This service could also be used for speed advisory messages based on weather or traffic conditions.   In later stages of deployment, control messages also could be sent to the vehicle.  
Intersection Reservation:  VII is used to allow cars to send information directly to the traffic light, allow the signal to adjust to demand, and to allow the signal to send back messages regulating vehicle speed.  The concept is that by the time the vehicle arrives at the signal, the light is green.  The intersection varies signal timing based on green requests.  Provides system level traffic smoothing mobility benefits.
VII-Enhanced Work Zone Operation – VII probe data is used to collect highly accurate information on work zone speed and throughput.  This could be used to send speed advisories and warnings to individual vehicles.  It could also allow agencies to set metrics for speed and volume through a workzone and require the workzone contractor to meet enforceable minimum performance levels.  Ultimately, temporary lateral control could be installed in work zones to improve speed and safety through workzones.
Trucking Capacity Management and Dynamic Routing – VII is used to provide specific route guidance to trucks as they enter the perimeter of an urban area.  The specific routing can be based on congestion, air quality, or other criteria.  This service could improve trip travel time and reliability for trucks, while improving trip reliability and air quality for car drivers in the area as well.  
MVII APPROACH AND DEPLOYMENT ISSUES
At this point in time, USDOT has a list of potential service concepts that would be enabled by VII technology that might have mobility benefits.  These service concepts were developed through a literature review and expert input.  USDOT would like to gather information on the service concepts, the possible mobility benefits, and the appropriate evaluation methods.  The purpose of gathering the information is to develop a work plan for a detailed multi-year program of research.

<SUBJECT>--Industry Input for Near Real Time Asset Visibility
<DESC>This notice requests input from industry prior to release of any resultant solicitation. The information in this notice is based on the best and most current information available to date. This information is subject to change and is not binding on t he Government. SCOPE: HQ US Army Field Support Command (AFSC) and HQ US Army Joint Munitions Command (JMC) require a methodology to track equipment and munitions throughout the entire supply chain. The Commands are requesting concepts for solution sets of enabling technology for near real time asset visibility, including health monitoring when required, for ordnance and war reserve asset management throughout the life cycle of the commodity. Specific attention should be paid to depot level operations, logis tics and distribution functionality. All potential solution sets will be Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO) certified for munitions operations and provide for encrypted transmission of data. HERO certified devices will be approved for use by the Department of Defense. Documented verification of HERO certification will be provided with responses. Responses without verification will not be considered (see Submittal Info below). Identification of assets shall occur, at a minimum, at layer 4 (container), and to the desired level of visibility, i.e., pallet (layer 3), outer pack (layer 2), inner pack (layer 1), or at the item (layer 0) and transmitted in a state of the art communications environment which requires little or no infrastructure.  Any solution, including hardware and software must be American National Standard Institute (ANSI) standard, non-proprietary (the government will own the protocols), interoperable and open systems compliant. Objectives of this effort are: a.) Improve the c onnectivity, timeliness, and integrity of location and status data for equipment and munitions. b.) Provide near-real-time location visibility of major end items and other assets. c.) Provide near-real-time status visibility of major end items and other as sets. d.) Improve worker productivity by automating source data collection. e.) Eliminate/minimize redundant data entry, paper logbooks, manual entry and data ambiguities. f.) Improve efficiency of data searches. g.) Introduce electronic data management (o pposed to managing paper forms). h.) Provide accurate and near-real-time Automated Identification Technology (AIT) data to enhance readiness. i.) Communicate data both vertically and horizontally. j.) Support existing and planned systems. k.) Incorporate e xisting 2D Bar codes for the electronic collection, storage, and management of source data traditionally collected by manual means. BACKGROUND: The HQ AFSC provides global logistics and joint munitions essential to the combatant commanders' ability to cond uct peacetime and wartime operations. The HQ JMC secures munitions readiness by providing logistics, industrial capability and acquisition support to the joint services and allies. Both the AFSC and JMC are in the business of distributing equipment and mun itions worldwide for the purposes of training troops and supporting operational contingencies. Munitions and equipment stores can be found in the Continental United States (CONUS) and throughout the European and Pacific Theaters. Efficient movement and dis tribution of munitions and equipment within the Theaters of Operation is an integral part of supporting the Global War on Terrorism and supporting troops in the Theater of Operation. FACTS: a.) 2.8M tons of munitions worldwide of which 2.0M tons are stored  in CONUS depots. b.) Army Prepositioned Stocks and munitions are stored in CONUS, the European and Pacific Theaters, Southwest Asia and afloat. ISSUE: The JMC has a mature and well established inventory and accountability process. The Accountable Property  Officer for munitions resides at the JMC. Systems are in place at all CONUS installations to account for munitions and track movements within the depots and ov er the road. All munitions within the CONUS base have been 2D bar coded to enhance and streamline the inventory and accountability processes. CONUS depots use a system called SDS (Standard Depot System) to account for munitions. SDS feeds the Command Commo dity Supply System (CCSS) at the HQ for reconciliation of records and accountability purposes. All of this takes place within a systems architecture that can be electronically transmitted to users and customers throughout the US. In the past, JMC had the r esponsibility to manage munitions at the wholesale sites. In this case, wholesale includes the CONUS installations with a Supply Depot Operations (SDO) mission. Accountability of munitions was forfeited to the military units when stocks were transferred to  retail sites. In this case, retail pertains to post, camps and stations that maintained their own Ammunition Supply Point (ASP). With the implementation of the Centralized Ammunition Management (CAM) concept, JMC manages munitions throughout the supply ch ain as a unified whole, essentially erasing the differentiation between wholesale and retail. This has created a unique problem in the Theater of Operation in SWA. Munitions are routinely shipped to Camps in Europe, Pacific and SWA for resupply initiatives  and training activities in-country. Stocks are tracked up to the point of receipt at the ASPs. Munitions are issued out of the ASPs in bulk quantities to units moving into Theaters of operation. Bulk quantities are often times broken down to smaller units  of issue while moving throughout the Theater and are positioned at Ammunition Holding Areas (AHA) strategically placed in close proximity to deployed troops. It is at that point in time when the accountability of munitions becomes particularly challenging . Deployed units do not have the necessary systems to automatically track and report munitions movement, nor do they have the required trained personnel. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if stocks issued out of the primary ASPs are in the hands of t he troops, expended and/or reserved for troops rotating in. The AFSC manages Army Field Support Brigades and Combat Equipment Battalion facilities worldwide. Integration of AIT is imperative in assuring warfighter material needs are satisfied. (AIT is defi ned as a suite of technologies that enable the automatic capture of source data, thereby enhancing the ability to identify, track, document and control deploying and redeploying forces, equipment, personnel and sustainment cargo.) The goals of the Army Pre positioned Stocks (APS) AIT effort are to optimize facility operations through improved connectivity of existing data systems, better visibility of asset location and status, and improved source data automation. AIT facilitates automated data collection wi th regard to operational materiel (equipment, repair parts, tooling, rolling stock) and the processes they pass through (stores, maintenance, quality assurance, handoff). Once collected, this data is used to improve communication, data integrity, and produ ctivity. SUBMITTAL INFO: Firms shall have documented verification of HERO certification, and such documentation shall be provided within the first 5 pages of the response. Responses without HERO verification will not be considered. Restrictive markings/lan guage placed on use of any of the information submitted will eliminate that submission from any further consideration. If you are interested and certified/qualified to perform the services sought, please submit a concept paper (4 paper copies required) for  review by no later than COB May 2, 2005 to U.S. Army Field Support Command, AMSFS-CCA-IS, Mrs. Michelle Kolar, Bldg 350, 5th floor, Middle Bay, Rock Island, IL 61299-6500. E-mail, fax or telephonic submittals will NOT be considered. There is no certain fo rmat for the concept paper, other than the requirement for hard copy submittals and HERO certification within the first 5 pages. Pictures, graphs, charts, drawi ngs, etc. may be included in your response (if necessary). This is not a solicitation, and no funds are available at this time for purchase. There are no specifications available for this notice. Should there be questions, they shall be submitted via e-mai l ONLY to kolarm@afsc.army.mil. Due to time constraints and limited availability of government technical personnel, the government may not be able to answer all questions prior to the deadline for receipt of proposed solutions. You are encouraged to procee d with submitting proposed solutions prior to the deadline, even if unanswered questions remain. Late submissions will not be considered. This is not a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract as a result of this notice, or to pay for a ny costs borne out of replying to this announcement. This notice neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This notice should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.

(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision)

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-05-R-625615 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This Request for Quotations incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-19.  This is small business set-aside procurement.  The NAICS is 721110.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals/bids are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This acquisition is issued as a Request for quote (RFQ).  (ii) The solicitation number is R153305.  (iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 97-27.  (iv) The associated North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 335999.  (v) The Government’s intention is to award the requirement as a small business set aside. (vi) 
Specification for Battery Test System. 

Introduction-

The following specifications describe a test system that will be used by the Division of Electrical and Software Engineering (DESE), Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL), Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA).  This test system shall have the capability to test most battery technologies over a wide range of performance parameters.  The battery technologies include lead acid, nickel cadmium, nickel metal hydride, lithium-based (lithium manganese dioxide, lithium-ion, etc.), and alkaline.  Also, this test system shall be capable of testing small fuel cells, super capacitors, and battery maintenance systems.

The test system described below will enable DESE personnel to test power sources used in medical devices, to experiment with new power sources, and to test power source ancillary systems.  These capabilities are necessary to assist the premarket regulation and postmarket oversight of medical devices.  

Detailed Requirements:
1.  Main Control/data acquisition system requirements:
a.  The Main Control/data acquisition system shall contain the power supply, internal microprocessor controller and peripheral components and circuits, battery interfacing circuits and connection terminals, and connections to the external controller computer.
b.  The power supply shall operate on nominal 120 Vac ± 10%  or 220 Vac ± 20 % power from common United States’ residential wall receptacles.
c.  The internal microprocessor controller shall handle the delivery of control signals to and collect data from the battery interface circuits (channels) and the thermocouple interface circuits.  Also, it shall handle the conveyance of data to and receive requests from the  external controller/computer.
d.  The main control/data acquisition system shall also include the following:
1)  A minimum of four test channels (four-terminal electronic loads) with the following capabilities (See Notes 1& 2 below):
a)  Voltage input capacity to +5Vdc 
b)  Load current ranges, full scale:  0 to 2A, 0 to 10mA, 0 to 10uA
c)  Maximum channel power:  10W
d)  Accuracy: 0.02 FSR.  
e)  Capable of operating in an electrical parallel connection such that four could be connected to handle a maximum total load current of 8A
f)  Controller software shall be capable of algebraically adding the currents and producing a reading as if the total was being handled by a single channel.
Note 1:  As discussed in this specification, an electronic load consists of at least one power transistor and the necessary drive circuitry to permit the transistor to function as a controlled resistor.  As a controlled resistor, it can be controlled such that it will source/sink a constant current to/from a battery or other source of dc power.  The transistor (with associated circuitry) can be adjusted by a microprocessor to maintain a constant power withdrawal from a battery or to maintain a constant charging voltage to a battery.
Note 2:  The meaning of “four-terminal” as it is used here is in reference to a Kelvin-type connection in which current is delivered to or withdrawn from a battery via two conductors (i.e., signal & ground), and voltage is sensed through two other conductors in which negligible current flows.  The reason for such a connection is to measure the battery voltage at its terminals without introducing error from the voltage drops across the resistance of the conductors which are conducting current from/to the battery. 

2)   A minimum of four shielded cables for connecting the test channels described in 1.d.1) above to the holders of the batteries to be tested.  These cables are to be four conductor-types with appropriate connectors to mate with input connectors of channels in 1.d.1) above.  Cables are to be six feet in length with a minimum current rating of 2.0 Adc.

3)  A minimum of eight test channels (four-terminal electronic loads) with the following capabilities:
a)  Voltage input capacity to +20Vdc 
b)  Load current ranges, full scale:  0 to 10A, 0 to 100mA, 0 to 1.0mA 
c)  Maximum channel power:  200W
d)  Accuracy: 0.02 FSR.  
e)  Capable of operating in an electrical parallel connection such that four could be connected to handle a maximum total load current of 40A dc.
f)  Controller software shall be capable of algebraically adding the currents and producing a reading as if the total was being handled by a single channel.

4)   A minimum of four shielded cables for connecting the test channels described in 1.d.3) to the holders of the batteries to be tested.  These cables are to be four conductor-types with appropriate connectors to mate with input connectors of channels in 1.d.3) above.  Cables are to be six feet in length with a minimum current rating of 10.0Adc.
5)  A minimum of two external charger switching adapter modules with each containing one test channel.  Each channel is to provide means of connection to an external power supply such that a battery connected to the channel may be charged by current provided by the external power supply.  Also, the channel shall have the same capabilities for monitoring battery voltage and charging current as the channels specified in 1.d.3) above. 
6)  One auxiliary input module that provides eight inputs for type-T thermocouples with delivery of temperature readings to the data bus of the system controller in the same manner as done by the test channels specified in 1.d.1) and 1.d.3) above.
7)  One module having a minimum of eight input channels for charging, discharging, and reading from and inputting data into a smart battery pack or system.  This includes the necessary connectors and wiring to connect to the smart battery connectors.  (The smart battery connectors are to be supplied by the customer).  If connected properly to a smart battery connector, each input channel shall have the ability to input and output data to a smart battery.  The system software will be required to provide programming flexibility to accommodate different smart battery communications protocols. 
8)  Minimum of one channel with capabilities for performing AC impedance measurements at 1.0 kHz sine wave, 200mA peak-to-peak / 70.7mA (RMS).  Additional test frequencies are acceptable.
9)  Physical chassis and enclosure necessary for mounting and housing circuit boards and the necessary power supplies and wiring to operate the channels/modules described in 1.d.1) through 1.d.8) above.  The main control/data acquisition system shall be housed in one enclosure and adequate cooling for its operation at maximum rated power dissipation shall be provided.

2.  External controller/computer requirements: 
An external controller computer and software (see #4 below) shall be included for data logging and processing and outputting to a  monitor; it shall have the following minimum capabilities/equipment:

a. Memory:  minimum of  512MB RAM, 
b. Hard drive capacity:  80 GB recordable and rewritable memory, 
c.  CD-Rom drive, 
d. General software:  Windows XP and MS-Office 2003.

This statement of work is for the manufacture of a center work stand for use in the sheet metal section of the HH60 product line at ARSC.  The total length is 18'.The forward part of stand will be 13'long and 91" from the floor.The aft part will step down to 82" and that section will be 5' in length.The change in the stand design is to accommodate the shape of the fuselage.The new stand will have 12 air tees installed and be evenly distributed on each side.The stand shall be made to act as a center work platform between two aircraft.The stand should include a set of removable steps that meet all OSHA requirements.  There should be lockable casters on each section.  The platform should have a set of form boards that run the length of the main platform and have the ability to extend approximately three to four feet to meet the contour of the aircraft.  The ends of the extendable boards should be equipped with some means to protect the aircraft from potential damage.  The extendable boards should extend and retract with a reasonable amount of force.There should be six electrical outlets (three each side) and four fluorescent work lights under the stand.  Shelving shall be installed under the staircase for storage.  The stand should have two gates on the forward section to mate with the existing system that is on that stands currently in the shop.  There need to be removable stanchions and chains on the sides.  These chains act as fall protection when there is no aircraft in that area.

<DESC>Due to the large number of questions and amendments on this solicitation, USUHS is issuing a completely revised solicitation.  We have added a new line for employees that are under Service Contract Act coverage.  We have added two additional years to the term.  USUHS will no longer be directly billed for leave or Federal holidays for any of the line items, include these costs in your multiplier.  We are revising the evaluation factors.  ALL QUOTES MUST BE RESUBMITTED.

This new solicitation supersedes all previous amendments.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This is a request for quotes (RFQ).

A.  Requirements:    The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) requires contractor support to provide temporary non-personal services in areas including, but not limited to:  administrative, professional, clerical, technical, scientific, medical and laborer positions.  This requirement is SET-ASIDE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ONLY.  Applicable NAICS Code is 561320-Temporary Help Services with a small business size standard of $11,500,000.   Firms with GSA or other FSS contracts may consider this a request for reduced pricing under FSS requote procedures.  The resulting order will be a five year IDIQ and USUHS will issue a separate task order for each position.  All five years shall be evaluated together.  This procurement is being conducted as a Commercial Items Acquisition in accordance with FAR Part 12, and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions.

Detailed statements of work or task statements will be included with each task order.  Usually, the USUHS will locate and recommend a potential individual for each position.  The contractor will then interview for the position, make a hiring decision, confirm the hourly price and make a formal employment offer.  Firms are instructed to propose a multiplier, which will be applied to the gross pay amount for each employee to calculate the hourly price.  Firms may propose a fixed dollar amount that may be charged to cover recruitment and interviewing costs when USUHS does not recommend the employee for a given position.  

Selected contractor shall be able to place an employee on site within 48 hours upon receipt of a signed task order after the employee is identified and becomes available.  The contractor and their employee will be paid only for hours actually worked or otherwise authorized.  The USUHS may change the hours required of any position with 24-hour notice to the contractor.  

Time Cards – The contractor will develop a time card to document the name of the person, USUHS Department assigned, hourly rate, hours actually worked for the time period, the cumulative number of hours worked, the number of hours funded/authorized and the number of hours remaining.  This time card will be verified in writing by the employee and USUHS personnel and a signed copy provided to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).  The contractor will not provide service for any task order in excess of the number of hours authorized by task order.

Invoices – The contractor may bill on a bi-weekly basis and the invoice will contain line item detail for each person.  The line will contain the person’s name and USUHS department, hours actually worked for the time period, the hourly price, the amount being billed, the cumulative number of hours worked, the number of hours funded/authorized and the number of hours remaining.  Copies of time sheets will be attached to each pay period summary.  The invoice will be submitted to the COTR (in both hard copy and MSExcel electronic format) and payment will be made by VISA purchase card.  

The contractor will be responsible for compliance with all Federal, State and local employment laws and regulations including withholdings, reporting and visa restrictions.  USUHS will provide base access and any required security investigations. On an as needed basis, the contractor will conduct or arrange background investigations and provide for any required occupational health and safety requirements (USUHS will reimburse the contractor for the cost of these investigations, examinations, etc.).  

The USUHS currently secures these services from Jardon & Howard Technologies, Inc. under delivery order #HU0001-05-F-0154 and previously through the Cooperative Administrative Support Unit (CASU) program.  There are currently approximately 32 individuals working under this order and an offeror should expect to transition most, if not all, of these individuals.  USUHS may rely upon this contract to a significantly greater extent in the future particularly for instructors, who are paid as consultants.

B.  Line Item/Prices

The contractor will supply personnel under the following conditions at the following prices:  (For line items 1 through 5 the firm shall propose a percentage by which the hourly price will be calculated for each position.  E.g. If a firm wishes to charge 7% above the gross amount paid to subcontractor or employee, it should propose a 107% multiplier.)

1.	Subcontract/Consultants:  Payments to be made once per month based upon hours worked or progress as confirmed by USUHS personnel.

(Insert 2 digits)          1___ % of amount of payment.


      2. Full time/part time with no paid leave or benefits.

(Insert 2 digits)          1____ % of wages paid


      3. Full time/part time with leave and Federal holidays. 

(Insert 2 digits)          1____ % of wages paid


       4. Full time/part time with comprehensive benefits.  (Provide details of corporate benefits and eligibility)

(Insert 2 digits)          1____ % of wages paid


5.	Positions covered under the Service Contract Act (SCA). 

(Insert 2 digits)          1____% of wages paid

  
      6. Recruitment charge
    
    $__________ per recruitment if no candidate is referred.

Because USUHS is not able to guarantee information on length of service and leave eligibility, proposers shall assume that all SCA employees are eligible for two weeks leave.  

Information on job titles and duties are provided on the basis of the best currently available information, but are not guaranteed to be accurate.  It is expected that the selected offeror will review all positions and assure compliance with all applicable Federal regulations.

Evaluation Factors: (Listed in order of importance)
1. Price (For evaluation purposes USUHS will assume 10, 5, 10, 35, 40 percent of billing will occur on line items 1 through 5 respectively.)
2. Past Performance-Offeror shall provide contact information on their five most pertinent contracts.
3. Corporate Experience in a Federal or health/scientific setting.
4. Corporate Benefits

The offeror shall submit along with their quote:
•	Contact information on five most pertinent contracts
•	Completed copy of 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications
•	Details on corporate benefits and eligibility
The entire quote package including coversheet shall be approximately twenty (20) pages.

The USUHS has been securing these types of services by contract, since the summer of 1998.  Currently USUHS is invoiced approximately $90,000 per month for these services.  Questions shall be submitted via e-mail to micreenan@usuhs.mil.  Questions must be received no later then 3:00 PM EST, April 18, 2005.  All questions will be answered in the next amendment to the solicitation.  All quotes and supporting materials must be in the Government’s possession no later 3:00 PM EST on April 27, 2005.  Quotes may be submitted via fax, e-mail, or mail.  If you would like to receive confirmation that your quote has been received provide an e-mail address on the coversheet of the quote package.

USUHS has determined that a portion of the titles under the current order may be subject to the Service Contract Act of 1965 (SCA).  Therefore, the following FAR clauses will be added to the award document 52.222-41, Service Contract Act of 1965; 52.222-42 (Reference Wage Determination 94-2103 REV (33), Fair Labor Standards Act and Service Contract Act-Price Adjustment (Multiple Year and Option Contracts); 52.237-2, Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation; 52.237-3, Continuity of Services; and 52.228-5, Insurance Work on a Government Installation.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation, Notice of Intent.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Affymetrix, for Custom Gene Chips, in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Submit offers on NOI-RML #5014. The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-27 dated 1/1/05. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), performs basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing six bacterial pathogen genomes was performed towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to purchase 90(ninety) custom chips from Affymetrix. This chip is unique and specific to RML.  The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of 2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array.  RML processes the chips in Frederick, MD (NIAID) which contains: the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system in place at Frederick, MD. FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be six(6)weeks after receipt of the order by Affymetrix.  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: (B)(1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract, basic agreement, basic ordering agreement, or blanket purchasing agreement resulting from this solicitation; 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors  Commercial; FAR52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions  Commercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders  Commercial Items.

<DESC>This amendment A) extends the closing date for the receipt of quotations to April 18, 2005 and B) answers vendor questions.

A) TIME EXTENSION:     By this amendment, the time and date for receipt of quotations is extended to 1630 EST, April 18, 2005..

B) RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS: 

1. Don’t understand the reason for the UL Listing charge.  Is this an item that you want manufactured for you? Or do you have a specific brand and part number you are looking for?

Response: The requirement is for an 8 outlet power strip that fits in a standard 19" rack mount (cabinet), 8' long power cord, 20 amp. 

There is a standard power strip that bolts into a cabinet, however the difference is these power strips are 20 amp rated.  (Most of the power strips purchased are 15 amp rated.)  SSA requires 20 amp power strips and they must be UL approved for safety reasons.  The UL charge is listed as a separate item in case there is a separate charge to obtain the UL.

2. Are there specifications available for clarification on the requirements of the power strip?

Response:  See the answer to question number 1..

3. Please furnish the manufacturer for the P/N BUD-0159-05.

Response: BUD Industries

4. May a substitution be made for another model/manufacturer?

Response: Yes, as long as it meet the specification stated on the requirement and in question number 1.  It must be UL approved.

5. Does the outlet have to be an 8 outlet power strip and 20amp? Can you go with a 10 outlet power strip?  If not, can you do an 8 outlet with a 15amp power strip?

Response:  More than 8 outlets are acceptable, but power strip must be 20amp..
