<DESC>The Division of AIDS (DAIDS) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has a requirement for a contractor to provide a comprehensive program to ensure that clinical laboratories in developing countries around the world can reliably perform tests to monitor the safety and efficacy of preventive and therapeutic products as part of clinical HIV/AIDS trials sponsored by the NIAID.  There is a need to evaluate laboratories’ ability and readiness to routinely conduct activities according to Good Laboratory Practice standards; to train, implement and monitor general QA/QC for pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical functions; to evaluate laboratories’ ability to correctly perform required study-specific tests, provide troubleshooting and training when needed, and implement and monitor on-site QA/QC for these tests; to prepare laboratories for participation in external proficiency testing (PT) programs for these tests, monitor performance in such PT programs and assist when performance is poor;  to ensure that study-specific tests are performed correctly and results are reported accurately; to design and implement tools to evaluate the ability of laboratories to perform required tests for which PT programs do not exist; and, only as an emergency, perform study-specific tests when laboratories are unable to do so and/or to verify test results.  This will require presence in developing areas that are centers of HIV infection, such as Southern Africa, Asia and the Caribbean Islands.  This will also require staff with medical technology/pathology background, expertise in training, knowledge of compliance with safety and ethics regulations, and knowledge of languages. The Government contemplates awarding one contract for accomplishing the tasks outlined in the Work Statement.  It is anticipated that this contract will have a five year performance period.

<DESC>The Chornobyl Research Unit (CRU), Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI), intends to enter into a sole-source contract with the Republican Research Center of Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology (RRCRMHE), Ilicha str., 290, 246042 Gomel, Belarus.  The CRU is responsible for research programs in radiation effects on thyroid cancer and leukemia.  CRU develops, administers, and evaluates contract-supported applied research programs.  The main purpose of the project, Study of Thyroid Cancer and Other Thyroid Disease in Belarus, which is comprised of smaller projects, is to carry out large-scale epidemiological and clinical-morphological studies in order to detect forms of thyroid pathology in subjects age 18 and under (in Apr. 86) who were exposed to radiation as released by the accident at the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Station in April 1986, and who had their dose to thyroid gland measured.  As a result of studies that have been carried out under other arrangements, coefficients of the risk of the development of thyroid cancer and other thyroid disease have been investigated; and analysis has been made of the relationship between the number of cases of cancer or disease per year and the distribution depending on the sex, age at the moment of exposure, geographical zone, time of appearance of disease and the age at the time.  Efforts have also been made to compare the carcinogenic effect of I-131 with that of x-ray and gamma-radiation.  Since 1986, the Ministry of Health has carried out screening of tens of thousands of children from contaminated areas of Belarus.  These investigations have included palpation and ultrasound scans, and numerous laboratory tests for the thyroid function.  During the first weeks after the accident, the Institute of Radiation Medicine in Moscow made direct measurements of thyroid radioactivity in nearly 40,000 person and these results represent a basis for individual dose assessment.  From these data, a cohort has been established of subjects who were age 18 or under at the time of the accident or who were still in utero; this cohort will ultimately include up to 12,000 persons.  The selected population of Belarusian children will be carefully examined by highly-skilled specialist biannually for up to 3 cycles in order to diagnose thyroid disease.  Th overall project has practical purposes, the most important is the fact that the investigations will provide a guide for minimizing the after-effects of the Chornobyl accident, in particular, thyroid disease in person who were exposed in their childhood.  The Republican Research Center of Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology (RRCRMHE) located in Gomel, is the heir to the original Clinical Research Institute of Radiation Medicine and Endocrinology (CRIRME) that was located in Minsk.  January 2003 the Ministry of Health reorganized CRIRME into RRCRMHE and relocated to Gomel.  The latter is the only official source known to the Government devoted to studies of the aftereffects of Chornobyl accident.   The RRCRMHE is the headquarters for this project and is the only organization that can carry out the work in Belarus both from their scientific capability and it’s designation as Republican Center for Belarus.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the Government needs.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office no later than December 17, 2003.  This action is pursuant to 41 USC 253(1) and under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The requirement will be procured as a non-commercial item in accordance with FAR Part 13.  If you have any questions, please contact Cynthia Brown, Purchasing Agent, (301) 402-4509.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collects calls will be accepted.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR), Patuxent River, Maryland, requires C40A aircraft Systems Engineering support from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the Navy’s eight C-40A aircraft beginning February 2004.  It is possible that the fleet size could grow by one-to-three aircraft a year through Fiscal Year 2008.  The C-40A aircraft are Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) certified, commercial derivative cargo/transport aircraft that have been modified with Navy specified requirements.  NAVAIR intends to contract for this requirement on a sole source basis with Derivative Airplanes Programs, The Boeing Company, Seattle, Washington.  The Government intends to award a base period of approximately nine months and four twelve month option periods, from February 2004 through October 2008, through the use of FAR Part 12 commercial contracting methods.  The contract will consist of a core effort and a provision for placing modifications for additional, as required efforts.  The core effort will consist of:  program management related effort; service action support; configuration management; Service Action Review Board support; technical documentation and technical publication revision services; twenty-four hour in-flight emergency/aircraft on ground support; product improvement planning; engine/auxiliary power units configuration data status accounting reporting; problem inquiry support; and support engineering to the C-40A Contractor Logistics Support contractor.  The provision for as required efforts will cover areas such as, but not be limited to: technical engineering assistance; engineering change proposals; rapid response engineering skills, services, and materials to support unforeseen and unpredictable events that affect the C-40A; accident investigations, training, and OEM field service representatives.  Additionally, these services will satisfy and maintain the Federal Aviation Administration certification process on the aircraft that is required by Federal Aviation Regulations, Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 23.  The Boeing Company is the original designer and manufacturer for the C-40 series aircraft, tooling, and unique support equipment and is the only complete source of historical, development, design, manufacturing, modifications, test and flight certification data for the aircraft that is necessary to successfully provide these services in an accurate and timely manner since the aircraft were procured as "off the shelf" FAA certified commercial derivative aircraft with Boeing retaining proprietary rights to technical data.  The Government does not currently possess sufficient in-house expertise or have the right to use Boeing’s proprietary data to allow other companies to perform the required specified tasks for these aircraft.  The estimated period of performance is February 2004 to October 2008.  The anticipated award date of the contract is 26 February 2004.  No solicitation document exists.  The contract will be awarded pursuant to FAR 6.302-1:  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to leann.warner@navy.mil .    See Numbered Note 22.

1.0	Description

1.1	Allied Command Transformation (ACT) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) announcement on behalf of the Deputy Assistant Chief of Staff Joint Experimentation, Exercises, and Assessment (DACOS JEEA). 
1.2	This Is A Request For Information (RFI) only. The intent is to only identify potential Vendors for on-site Contractor support in building an operational concept development and experimentation (CD&E) program for NATO.
1.3	This RFI DOES NOT constitute a current Request for Proposal (RFP) nor a promise to issue a future RFP. ACT is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals prior to potential release of an RFP in late January 2004. Respondees are advised that NATO will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI. All costs for responding to this RFI shall be borne solely by the responding Vendor. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP when issued. 
1.4	Planning, Vendors should consider potential Contractor support to consist of 15-25 on-site personnel with short-term surge capability of 5-10 additional personnel for fiscal 2004. Contractor personnel may be further increased in fiscal 2005 and the out years. Expected specialties will include: project management, contracting support, information technology support, concept developers, experimenters, and operations research analysts. 
1.5	Any future RFP that may be released shall be listed on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov). Vendors are responsible for monitoring this site for additional information on this requirement.

2.0	Background 
2.1	DACOS JEEA is seeking Contractor support to help design and conduct a credible NATO-wide CD&E program, and develop metrics to identify the program’s successes and deficiencies. The design and metrics must have sufficient detail to identify opportunities to improve warfighting capability, especially relating to the NATO Response Force (NRF). This RFI seeks responses that will be used in developing and issuing a proposed RFP for Contractor services by the end of January 2004. 
2.2	The mission of ACT is to lead Alliance Transformation. Experimentation works with Concept Development to be the highly adaptive engine to accomplish this Transformation mission. Experimentation is the intellectual engine for the entire Transformation process. For a Transformation Command, experimentation equals the ammunition and fuel to the warfighter. No new concept nor capability should (or will) be moved into doctrine, interoperability work, training, capability packages, or force proposals until validated through credible experimentation. Experimentation controls the pace of Transformation. In the Transformation environment, the effectiveness of the entire process depends on delivering credible products. 
2.3	ACT provides a common NATO setting for experimental activities. ACT expects to accomplish experimentation objectives in various ways including: building experimental venues in which future-looking concepts can be validated; using existing exercises in which mature concepts can be demonstrated by NATO agencies and nations; leveraging the efforts of others such as NATO nations, coalition partners, industry, business, and academia; and by being involved in training and innovation shown by operational commanders.

3.0	Requested Information
3.1	White Paper. Vendor companies and organizations are invited to provide a white paper, of no more than 15 pages, on their operational CD&E experiences; previous demonstrations of; and capabilities to design, develop, conduct, and assess capabilities to support an experimentation program. The white papers shall be due by 1600 hours on 5 Jan 2004. Information in the white papers will be considered in developing any potential final Statement of Work requirements. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and clearly marked as such. Please be advised that all submissions become NATO property and will not be returned. The white papers shall be in Microsoft Word for Office 2000-compatible format, and shall not contain classified information. The white papers shall address, at a minimum, the following concepts and methods to: 
·	Design a CD&E program.
·	Conduct a CD&E program. 
·	Assess the validity, successes, and deficiencies of the program.
3.2	White Paper Addendum. The white paper shall include the following information in a separate attachment, which will not be included in the 15-page limitation.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM-ARDEC has a requirement for a multi-year contract for the production of M231 PA161 and M232 PA103A2 Containers. This procurement is 100%  small business set-aside.  The PA161/PA103A2 containers are the shipping and  storage containers used for the Modular Artillery Charge System (MACS).  The  MACS Propelling Charge, designed and developed at Picatinny Arsenal, provides a complete zoning solution for 155mm Artillery applications by using multiples  of a basic increment.  The containers were developed to protect the MACS  Charges throughout the Army’s stringent logistic environments and have design  features that improve the insensitive munitions characteristics for the MACS  system.  The Government reserves the right to make multiple awards from the  RFP.  A critical component of the PA161/PA103A2 is steel and the current lead-time is 90-120 days.  Samples of the PA161 and PA103A2 Containers will be required to be submitted with proposals in response to the RFP. The successful offeror must be ISO 9002 certified by the date of award.  Request all information be submitted via electronic media to mrhines@pica.army.mil., Margaret Rhinesmith,(973)724-3050.  Large files need to be compressed using WinZip, http://www.winzip.com.  The MACS and its  components are on the Militarily Critical Technologies List (MCTL) Aug 1966.  Therefore, the MACS TDP is restricted by the Arms Export Control Act (Title 22, U.S.C. SEC 2751) and is subject to DoD Directives 5230.24 and  5230.25. See Numbered Notes 1, 8, and 25.

On behalf of all the NIH Institutes through the Trans-NIH Roadmap initiative, The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is soliciting proposals from all interested organizations to participate in the ?Re-Engineering the Clinical Research Enterprise? component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap for Accelerating Medical Discovery to Improve Health, described at http://nihroadmap.nih.gov/ .  A long range goal of the clinical research component of the NIH Roadmap is to foster clinical research networks that are based on common or inter-operable infrastructure elements that conduct research both in academic and clinical care settings. The NHLBI is soliciting feasibility study proposals that will test solutions to overcoming existing barriers to this long range goal.  The period of performance will be for a maximum of up to three years, beginning on or about September 30, 2004.  This announcement serves to notify and invite all responsible sources interested in performing as a Clinical Research Network to submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Clinical Research Network is defined as ?an organization of clinical field sites and investigators that conducts multiple research protocols, often with more than one protocol ongoing at a time.  The organization of sites and investigators may be formal or informal as long as the network?s collaborative accomplishments can be shown. Observational and outcomes research are considered part of the definition of clinical research.  The NIH is not seeking the development of new networks in this feasibility phase.  Only existing networks will be eligible for award under this solicitation. This is not the actual Request for Proposal - Broad Agency Announcement (RFP/BAA); the RFP/BAA # BAA-NIH-NHLBI-RM-04-23 must be downloaded from the NIH Web Site, which will be available on or about December 2, 2003, at the following address: http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/funding/inits/index.htm#nhlbi  The due date for proposal submission is March 5, 2004.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to deliver two (1) Environmenal Data Quality Assurance (EDQA) course.   The course will be offered in San Antonio and Seattle. The objectives of this course are to introduce Installation Restoration Program (IRP) personnel to the Data Quality Assurance (DQA) process, review relevant statistics that support the process, and engage the students in applying DQA processes to commonly encountered environmental sampling situations.  The use of relevant statistical techniques shall be addressed using the case study method.  Typical environmental sampling situations encountered by IRP personnel include assessing the magnitude, extent, and hazards of environmental contamination in soil, water, groundwater, sites and facilities from past military activities or that may arise as a result of recovery operations after an accident or other emergency response situation.  In addition, IRP offices maintain significant amounts of historical environmental data that must be evaluated using the DQA process.  

1.1  Scope - The scope of this project is to provide training and curriculum materials for applying the DQA processes and related statistical methods to assess and make decisions regarding the magnitude, extent, hazards, and need for environmental sampling.  In addition, the training will include the application of the DQA processes to common sampling situations.  Training will consist of providing a concise student manual that describes guidelines for using the DQA approaches for environmental sampling.  The contractor shall deliver one course to a maximum audience of 25 students each.  This audience will be engineers with degrees ranging from a Bachelor of Science to Ph.D.  Because of the highly skilled nature of the student body, the contractor shall ensure that a recognized Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the field of DQO and DQA conducts the teaching of the statistical lectures.  The contractor shall identify the SME to the USAFSAM/ATO POC at the Technical Interchange Meeting for final approval.  The length of the course is expected to be no more than 5 days.  A tentative schedule is contained in the attachment.  Quality assurance provides applicability to environmental sampling management.  For the quality assurance assessment, the following will be included in the course:  assessment of the data will be performed throughout the scenarios introduced during the DQO process.  Data validation will then be performed either on all data, by including this step with the validation process, or on separate pieces of the data by random selection.  This verification ensures that all quality assurance is properly implemented.  After the data is validated and verified, the assessment is performed.  This process evaluates all known data for the scenario in order to provide additional information to the decision-maker on the risk in making the decision.  After the data assessment is complete the data life cycle output equates to the conclusions drawn from the data.  
For Complete SOW e-mail mark.rounsavill@brooks.af.mil
Send CV on each instructor.  Each instructor shall have experience in instructing 2 each very similar courses as minimum requirement and as a go-no go criteria. Price will be the determining factor after the go is met

<DESC>Sources Sought for Seats in Summer Distance Learning High School Remediation Courses

This notice issued by the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) Curriculum Branch is to identify possible sources capable of providing summer distance learning high school remediation courses for high school students located both overseas and stateside who need course credits in the core subject areas to graduate.

DoDEA is seeking sources that can provide seats in the above distance learning courses equivalent to a standard 36 week in-class offering, facilitate the courses, assess student progress in the courses and report progress and end-of-course assessment results to DoDEA.  Anticipated courses are those required for graduation.

Course delivery must be compatible with the nature of our student population; it must be distance learning but it may be in various formats such as web-based, CD based, correspondence, etc.  Student access to the courses may occur in varying locations (home, base community centers, etc.), and at varying times due to different time zones.  Capabilities of facilities providing access may also vary.

All information received from this announcement will be compiled and used for planning purposes.  Any proprietary information received should be marked appropriately.  Sources are urged to describe their technology in sufficient detail to allow DoDEA to define subsequent proposal opportunities.  Any vendor interested in providing this service should submit a capability statement to Sharla R. Ross. 

The information received in response to this announcement will be reviewed and summarized. Recommendations may form the content of a procurement action that DoDEA may issue at a future date.

Schedule

Deadline for Submission: 15 December 2003

Responses should be sent via electronic mail to: sross@hq.odedodea.edu

<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) anticipates award of a Firm-Fixed Price Design-Build contract for (1)  the DESIGN of a medium security Federal Correctional Institution (FCI) and a minimum security Federal Prison Camp (FPC) to be located in Fresno County, California; (2) the SITE PREPARATION of the FCI and FPC will be a CONTRACT OPTION subject to factors which will include funding availability in fiscal year 2005 and may be exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Phase Two Solicitation; and additionally, (3) the CONSTRUCTION of the FCI and FPC will be a CONTRACT OPTION subject to factors which will include funding availability in fiscal year 2005 and may be exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Phase Two Solicitation.  The scope of work includes all architectural, engineering, construction and other related services necessary to provide a new  federal correctional facility.    The proposed project is currently planned to consist of a group of buildings in a “campus plan” arrangement with related site utilities and site development. This Federal Correctional Institution will have a gross building area of approximately 55,000 square meters and be designed to house and support approximately 1152 inmates.  The Federal Prisons Camp will have a gross building area of approximately 3,400 square meters and be designed to house and support approximately 128 inmates.  Interested offerors are advised that the proposed project site is located within a geographical area which has been identified as having a potential for liquefaction of the soils during periods of seismic activity.  The anticipated performance period of this project is approximately 915 days after the notice to proceed is issued.  The estimated magnitude of the base contract with options is more than $75,000,000.  For consideration on this project the offeror at a minimum must be a firm or joint venture with experience, individually or as a member of a team, successfully and satisfactorily completing a project of similar size and scope.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.  For the design member of the design-build team, the Architect/Engineer (A/E) of Record of the architect-engineer firm, or the principal or lead A/E firm of a joint venture, must have an existing major active office, which will have responsibility for the plans and specifications,  located within the State of California.  The design of the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, civil, or other engineering features of the work shall be accomplished or reviewed and approved by architects or engineers registered to practice in the particular professional field involved in the State of California.  Participation by architects, engineers, consultants and subcontractors located within the State of California is encouraged.  Participation by small, small-disadvantaged, HUBZone small businesses, woman-owned small businesses, veteran-owned businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses is encouraged.  The Offerors included in Phase Two will be required to submit a subcontracting plan for this procurement regarding the utilization of small, small-disadvantaged, woman-owned small, veteran-owned small businesses, and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  The FBOP will be utilizing two-phase Design-Build selection procedures.  This notice is not a request for proposals.  Interested offerors may request and obtain a Phase One solicitation of the two phase process, distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunities web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Hard copies of the Phase One solicitations will not be available.  The web site provides downloading instructions.  All future information regarding this acquisition,  including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this web site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the web site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition.  Phase One solicitations will be issued on or about 12/15/03.  The Phase One proposal due date will be identified in the Phase One Solicitation.  The Phase One solicitation will provide the scope of work, and the following evaluation factors including subfactors, which are all in descending order of importance:  Past Performance (Sub-factors: Past  Performance Quality Control and Quality Assurance, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment of Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems), Technical Qualifications and Technical Approach.  Phase One qualification proposals will be evaluated to determine which firms will be selected as offerors for Phase Two.  Phase Two participants will submit competitive past performance, technical, small business and price proposals as defined in the Phase Two solicitation.  The Phase Two evaluation factors, in descending order of importance are:  Past Performance (descending order Sub-factors: Past Performance Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Relevance of Past Performance, Demonstrated Commitment of Team Members and Key Personnel, and Performance Problems);  Preliminary Design and Proposed Technical Solutions;  Proposed Organization and Key Personnel, Consultants and Subcontractors (descending order Sub-factors: Project Team Organization, Design-Build Offeror including Key Personnel, Consultants and Sub-contractors including Key Personnel); Management and Scheduling Approach, including Quality Control and Quality Assurance (Sub-factors: General Approach including Team Coordination and Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Proposed Design-Build Schedule and Monitoring of the Schedule, Planning for Project Completion);  Small Business Subcontracting;  are significantly more important than Price, however, as proposals become more equal, price becomes more important and may be a determining factor for award.  Additional or Bonus points may be awarded for Technical, Past Performance, and/or Small Business Subcontracting proposals.  The point of contact for inquiries and clarifications is Elaina S. Walker, Contracting Officer, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Construction Contracting Section, 320 First Street NW, Room 500-2, Washington, D.C. 20534.

2. ISSUANCE DATE: December 2, 2003
3. CLOSING DATE/TIME SPECIFIED  
   FOR RECEIPT OF APPLICATIONS: December  23, 2003
4. POSITION TITLE: Senior Multi-sector Advisor  – USAID/Kosovo
5. MARKET VALUE: $ 85,140.00 - $ 110,682.00 per annum  (GS 15 – equivalent) 
6. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: To be determined, but not to exceed 120 days annually
7. PLACE OF PERFORMANCE: Pristina, Kosovo 
8. POSITION DESCRIPTION: 

I.   Background:

USAID manages development and transition programs in Kosovo financed through Support for Eastern European Democracies (SEED) funds.  Total SEED assistance for Kosovo is about $85 million annually, of which USAID/Kosovo manages roughly $31 million.  The Mission recently completed a new five-year Strategic Plan organized around a Results Framework containing five strategic objectives (SOs) – SO 1.2, Improved Policy and Institutional Climate for Private Investment; SO 1.3, Accelerated Growth of the Private Sector, SO 2.1, Civil Society and government are more effective partners in achieving good governance, and SO 2.2, More Open and Responsive Government Acting According to the Rule of Law,and SO 4.1, Special Initiatives (health, energy, and anti-trafficking). An additional program objective, 4.2, implements cross-cutting programs such as training and education.  The new strategic plan also identified five cross-cutting themes that will influence work undertaken in the strategic areas noted above.  They include conflict mitigation, specifically returns and reintegration, corruption, gender, youth, and human capacity development.  

In order to effectively implement the newly-approved strategy, numerous project designs are contemplated for the next year. The Mission is designing, contracting and implementing these new mechanisms in a carefully phased manner to avoid lapses in the provision of key technical assistance and training to the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), the Kosovar government, NGOs, and the Kosovar private sector.

As an additional mechanism to strengthen Mission management under existing staffing constraints, Mission intends to contract for the intermittent services of a Senior Multi-sector Advisor (SMA) to provide a management “surge capability” to help deal with peak periods of SO management.  

II.  Basic Function of the Position: 

The incumbent will serve intermittently as a SMA, who will provide program guidance and support for the design, implementation and monitoring of the portfolios associated with the primary Mission Strategic Sectors: Democracy and Governance and Economic Reform.  The Advisor will assist SO teams and participate in activity development, implementation, monitoring, and results reporting.  As an intermittent Advisor, the incumbent will perform the work of the assignment during a series of up to 4 TDYs totaling not more than 120 days annually.

III.  Major Duties and Responsibilities:

Serves as an expert advisor and technical authority on complex and, often, precedent-setting policy and activity issues, developing policies, strategies, and plans for development assistance programs for Mission SO teams and implementing partners. Incumbent will provide specialized expertise to Mission Offices and SO Teams in designing and monitoring policies, strategies, and programs.  For the primary SOs, provides support in drafting and finalizing activity and team reporting documents.  SMA advises Mission SO teams on new developments, and the most effective approaches to problems of development assistance in the country, and articulates the benefits of interventions to effectively reach specific target audiences.  Incumbent will provide technical advice, guidance, and support to Mission SO teams on technical and related program issues regarding the design, implementation, management, and evaluation of activities and activity portfolios.  In role of acting SO team leader, provides technical liaison with other USG Agencies, other donor organizations, multilateral banks, PVOs/NGOs, and other organizations to coordinate their efforts with specific USAID SO programs, activity portfolios and approaches in Kosovo.

SMA provides technical and managerial guidance for Mission SO research topics and activity-specific issues.  S/he coordinates incorporation of the research findings into implementable interventions within the Mission SO portfolios.  Provides expert advice and state-of-art professional assistance and support on policy, activity and SO portfolio implementation planning issues in development assistance.  

Incumbent provides assistance to SO teams and their partners in the organization and management of performance reviews and assessments.  Based on the outcomes, SMA assists SO teams in developing or modifying annual procurement plans and in adjusting the design of new/ongoing activities, as appropriate.  Over the course of the assignment, the Advisor will organize and conduct internal performance reviews of the activity portfolios of each Mission SO.  SMA assists selected SO Teams in the design and oversight of sectoral and multi-sectoral assessments, and special topic analyses.    

Maintains knowledge of current literature in order to advise USAID/Kosovo to facilitate and coordinate activities in selected SO development assistance areas.  Attends conferences and meetings for the purposes of professional interchange, and establishes and maintains effective working relationships with colleagues and institutions in related fields.

Prepares, or oversees the preparation of activity and SO authorizations, funding documentation, and related implementation letters.  Incumbent participates, as requested, in the review of contractor selection and approval, including preparing related documents such as invitations for bid, and plans and specifications for professional services.  Coordinates, as required, the evaluation of activities and activity portfolios to ascertain impact and cost effectiveness, including implications for future activities.   

Advisor plays a key role in development and review of USAID/Kosovo SO activities and activity portfolios.  Ensures all phases of project and non-project activity are developed to meet technical, legal, financial, statutory, regulatory and policy requirements.  As needed, assists SO Teams in developing SOWs for sector-level assistance initiatives and interventions.         

Incumbent utilizes research findings to assist respective SO teams to refine overall efforts to achieve SOs and associated intermediate results, taking into consideration decreased budgets and other constraints.  Analyzes trends with respect to the implications for selected Mission SOs and makes recommendations for action to SO teams and team leaders.  As directed, organizes and leads internal SO team exercises to identify the parameters of new assistance initiatives and interventions. 

Performs other duties as assigned.

IV.   Management Controls

The Advisor will report to the Program Officer or his/her designee.  S/he will be expected to function with a high degree of autonomy within general USAID policies and management guidelines.  When functioning as acting SO team leader, the SMA will exercise the same supervisory functions as the team leader. 

V.  Desired Qualifications:

In order to perform the duties described above, the SMA should have the following qualifications:

•	A demonstrated record of increasing responsibility and experience in the design, management and implementation of activities and SO activity portfolios.  A combination of activity design and management skills is highly desirable.  
•	Familiarity with technical issues in democracy and governance and economic growth is a plus.
Familiarity with USAID policies and procedures relating to activity design, budgeting implementation, and evaluation.  Basic familiarity with USAID acquisition regulations is highly desirable.

•	Familiarity with SO activity and portfolio management, results frameworks and performance measurement.
•	Strong interpersonal and communication skills with a demonstrated ability to work collaboratively with a range of professional counterparts.
•	Superior written and oral communication skills.  The ability to meet tight deadlines with concise documents and oral interpretation is required.

<ARCHDATE>02292004
<CONTACT>Major Orlando Dimalanta, Program Manager, Phone 801-586-0806, Fax null, Email orlando.dimalanta@hill.af.mil
<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis for a safe-fuze for the BLU-97 submunitions used in the CBU-87 and CBU-103 combined-effects munitions.  It is intended as a method of informing potential contractors of the existence of an interest in this subject by the government and to determine market interest and business capability.  This announcement is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  The government does not intend to pay for the information being solicited.

The intent of this sources sought synopsis is to explore the types of safe-fuze technology available in industry that can be incorporated into BLU-97 submunitions in existing CBU-87 and CBU-103 munitions.  Regarding this effort, the primary objective is to ensure unexploded BLU-97s left on the battlefield are always rendered safe and or destroyed using a self-destruct feature.  An effective safing mechanism would leave zero lethal submunitions on the battlefield.  

Successful solutions will meet the following requirements: 1) ensure with high confidence, any unexploded BLU-97 becomes completely inert and or self-destructs; 2) maintain existing BLU-97 performance against current target sets; 3) be fully compatible with CBU-87 and CBU-103 munitions; 4) be fully compliant with  Air Force safety requirements; 5) be capable of insertion into existing BLU-97s through a modification program and; 6) have a minimum 20-year shelf life.

Proposed industry solutions and rough order magnitude cost may be used in the future by the government to determine the feasibility of incorporating a render-safe and or self-destruct capability into existing CBU-87 and or CBU-103 munitions.  To date, neither definite plan nor funding exists to support this notion. Responses from interested parties should include the proposed technology solution and a rough order magnitude cost to realize it. Interested parties should also include detailed information outlining the capabilities they have which will allow them to accomplish the desired goals. Proprietary information will be protected by the government.  

The POC for this effort is:   Major Orlando Dimalanta	Phone # 801-586-0806

                     Hill AFB, UT 84056-5816

The requested information is due to the Air Force POC by close of business on 
January 30, 2004.  All DOD approved contractors domestic and foreign, are encouraged to respond.

<DESC>SUBJ:  Sources Sought for Medical/Surgical:  Dental Items This is a Market Survey and Request for Samples to locate potential sources for the standardization of various medical/surgical items.  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) desires to offer its customers, on a national basis, the best possible products and prices and to offer its contractors more opportunities within the system.  The intent of the standardization program is to establish national mandatory sources for medical/surgical items to standardize VA_s purchasing of products.  BIDS/OFFERS ARE NOT BEING SOLICITED AT THIS TIME.  A formal solicitation or request for quotations may be issued at a later date.  Companies interested in having their items evaluated for possible inclusion in the standardization process should carefully review the item descriptions listed below.  If a company can provide any of these items, SAMPLES OF ALL ITEMS AVAILABLE THAT MEET OR EXCEED THE CRITERIA PROVIDED IN THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS SHOULD BE SUBMITTED AT THIS TIME.  Additional criteria may be added (or existing criteria deleted) during the evaluation process.  If this occurs, all samples received will be evaluated equally against the revised criteria.  All samples submitted must be clearly marked with the name of the potential offeror, the product number, and the manufacturer_s name.  NOTE:  ALL SAMPLES SUBMITTED MUST BE MANUFACTURED IN A DESIGNATED COUNTRY, A CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRY, OR A NAFTA COUNTRY (UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO).  THE USER GROUP WILL ONLY EVALUATE SAMPLES MANUFACTURED IN APPROVED COUNTRIES.  A LISTING OF DESIGNATED COUNTRIES AND CARIBBEAN BASIN COUNTRIES MAY BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: http://www.arnet.gov/far/current/html/25.html#25.003.  Potential offerors must also include any corresponding detailed product literature with the samples.  Detailed product literature should include, but not be limited to, an indication of what materials the products are comprised of (e.g. latex, etc.), country of origin, and a listing of sizes, configurations, etc. available.  If detailed literature is not received with the samples, the technical evaluation panel may be unable to fully evaluate the samples and the products could be eliminated from further consideration.  If the detailed literature provided does not sufficiently address all of the listed criteria, the product may be eliminated from further consideration without further discussion. **Please send samples (number of samples required follow each product name) and corresponding detailed product literature to: Department of Veterans Affairs, Item Management Division (049A5S), ATTN:  Carl Hunter, Building 37, First Avenue - One Block North of Cermak Road (22nd Street), Hines, IL  60141.**  Companies submitting samples are also encouraged to obtain Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contracts for those products from the respective government contract office.  VA has the option of awarding a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) against an FSS contract rather than issuing a formal solicitation for the purpose of standardization.  If VA chooses to use a BPA as the contracting method, those companies who do not have their products on an FSS contract will be eliminated from the competition.  Similarly, if VA chooses to use a BPA, VA will use the items submitted in response to this request for samples and the results of the evaluations performed on those items to determine which companies are requested to participate in the resulting Request for Quotations. The VHA Medical/Surgical User Group, a group of VA physicians, nurses and clinicians who have expertise and knowledge of the products, will review and technically evaluate any samples submitted.  VA deems the members of the User Group to be medical experts.  Therefore, they are qualified to determine which products are acceptable.   NOTE: SAMPLES FOR ANY ITEM THAT INCLUDES A REQUIREMENT THAT THE PRODUCT  MEETS A SPECIFIC STANDARD (e.g. AAMI, ASTM, etc.) MUST INCLUDE LITERATURE OR A LETTER FROM THE MANUFACTURER INDICATING HOW THE PRODUCT MEETS THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT. SAMPLES AND PRODUCT LITERATURE MUST BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN JANUARY 19, 2003.  Companies not submitting samples by the above date may be eliminated from consideration on any subsequent procurement action for these items.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Automated Pipetting Instrument and Specimen Collection Containers
<DESC>THIS SPECIAL NOTICE IS BEING PRESENTED AS AN "INFORMATION SOUGHT".  NO PROPOSAL IS BEING SOUGHT AT THIS TIME.  FOLLOWING ARE THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE INSTRUMENT AND CONTAINERS.  

1.  REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTOMATED PIPETTING INSTRUMENT (API) AND SPECIMEN COLLECTION CONTAINER (SCC) FOR USE IN THE MILITARY DRUG TESTING LABORATORIES UNDER THE DOD DRUG DETERRENCE PROGRAM.

1.1.  Basic Concept.  The military drug testing laboratories have an interest in procuring an automated pipetting instrument (API) and compatible urine specimen collection container (SCC) to automate the manual urine specimen pouring procedure currently in use within the six military drug testing laboratories.  SCC's received in the laboratory shall be opened, organized, labeled if needed, placed into the API for aliquoting to receiver test tubes that are located in Hitachi racks, finally the Hitachi racks are loaded into Hitachi trays for testing on the Hitachi analyzer.  This system affects both the field collection processes and the laboratories sample handling and testing processes with the goal of enhancing the forensic quality and process efficiency of the drug testing program.   To accomplish this goal the API shall offer a rugged instrument design that provides a high degree of forensic accuracy and assurance in operations to meet the stringent legal challenges of a military court martial.  The API shall improve efficiency in the laboratory by replacing repetitive manual sample pouring operations and by interfacing the API and the Hitachi high-speed analyzer system.  The SCC shall also offer ease of urine collection of both male and female military members and minimize the impact on environmental disposal and bulk storage on shipboard and field operations.  The SCC shall also offer a high degree of forensic integrity in the collection, transportation, and aliquot process to meet the stringent legal challenges of a military court martial.  

1.1.1.  The API shall be used in the urinalysis specimen pouring and accessioning areas in the military drug laboratories.  The API shall include all components (i.e. sample racks, carriages, holders, or inserts, and bar-code readers) necessary to perform the forensic transfer of urine aliquots from SCC's to receiver test tubes pursuant to drug testing.  The SCC's shall be used in the field for sample collection, storage, and transport to the drug testing laboratories.  The SCC kit shall include 12 specimen collection cups, a 12 well shipping container, and accompanying tamper evident tapes (as needed) to optimize sample handling in the field as well as provide optimal forensic integrity.

2.  Description of the API.

2.1.  The API shall be an automated sample processing system that eliminates manual specimen pouring while maintaining forensic integrity of the specimen.  The API shall be capable of using the Hitachi 5-well test-tube racks and the Hitachi 30-rack carrier tray as part of the API system for the direct loading and unloading of sample batches from the API onto the Hitachi Modular Analyzer.  The requirement for adapting the Hitachi 30 rack carrier tray and 5-well test tube rack is to minimize technician intervention in operation of the API associated with manual on-loading and off loading of each Hitachi test-tube rack on the API.  The API shall require no more than 1 hour setup and maintenance at the beginning and end of a 16 hour (2 shift) work day; have a fluid depth sensing probe to minimize external surface contamination of the pipette tip and ensure aliquot aspiration; have no evidence of cross-contamination during transfer and dispensing of the aliquot into the receiver test tube; and, be able to process batches of approximately 100-150 SCC specimens and 100-150 test tubes in a run.

3.  Essential Characteristics of the API.

3.1.  The API system shall require no more than 2 technicians per eight-hour shift to achieve a minimum throughput of 400 samples per hour for a minimum daily throughput of 5,600 member samples within 14 hours for up to six days per week. 

3.2.  The system shall include enough API processing accessory units (i.e. SCC racks, SCC holders) for 8,000 samples at any given time.  The cost of all required components, sub-components, and accessories of the API system shall be included in the total price of the system.

3.3.  DoD Instruction 1010.16 indicates that nothing shall enter the specimen container.  While an API that maintains this characteristic is desirable, the cost and complexity involved in achieving the desired degree of automation may necessitate consideration of alternative procedures with forensic safeguards acceptable to the Military Legal Community.  The Legal Community has favorably considered the use of disposable pipette tips between sample aliquots and other enhancements to ensure that no foreign material or cross contamination can occur during operation of the API.  If a disposable pipette tip is used it must conform to these guidelines.  The use of disposable pipette tips shall be of sufficient volume to transfer the desired volume in a single step.  The pipette tip shall be automatically disposed of and changed with a new pipette tip in a safe and forensically acceptable manner between each sample. The pipette tip and fitting to the API shall be secure to ensure there is no splatter or leakage of sample during the operation of the API.  Other processes will be considered if they adhere to DOD Instruction 1010.16.    

3.4.  The contractor shall provide an API that will be able to extract, in a forensically acceptable manner, approximately 1.0 ml aliquot of urine from the SCC. The minimum acceptable volume for transfer is 0.75 ml.

3.5.  The API shall transfer approximate 1.0 ml urine aliquots from the SCC's to 16x100 mm glass receiver tubes that are in 5-well Hitachi test-tube holders without leakage or splattering of sample during the transfer process.  The 5-well tube holders are provided by Roche Diagnostics as part of the high speed Roche-Hitachi modular analyzers used within the military drug testing laboratories.  The API shall be adaptable to use the Hitachi 30-rack transfer tray for off loading the receiver sample test tubes for direct transfer to the Roche Hitachi analyzer.  No modification of either the Hitachi modular system or the Roche 5-well test tube holders shall be required to conform to the operation of the API system.  

3.6.  If pipette tips are used they shall be commercially available disposable plastic pipette tips.  

3.7.  If a penetration port is used for entering the container, the port shall be able to withstand a minimum of two potential sampling entries through the port without the port leaking fluid if the SCC is tipped on its side or inverted for up to one week, or repeatedly frozen and thawed for up to 3 freeze/thaw cycles.  If a penetration port is used, the API pipette system shall be constructed so the disposable pipette tip is able to penetrate any tamper evident/resistant seal placed across the penetration port (if required) and the port itself.  

3.8.  The API system is defined as all components necessary to hold and perform sample aliquoting of urine samples from sample containers to receiver test tubes.  As specified in section 1.1.1, this includes, but is not limited to SCC racks, SCC carriages, SCC holders, inserts, and bar-code readers.

3.9.  The contractor shall support the maintenance and service of the API system under an initial one-year full service warranty with response times within 1 hour telephonically and onsite service within 24 hours, except for the Hawaii drug laboratory which would require on-site service within 36 hours.  The API system shall have a 95% or better uptime, based upon the percentage of time available during the operating hours at the full volume capacity specified in this solicitation.  Routine spare parts shall be available onsite at each laboratory to minimize potential downtime, and is especially required for the Hawaii facility.

3.10.  The API system shall operate from utilities listed below.  115 VAC+/- 10%, 60Hertz+/- 2 Hertz or 208 VAC+/- 10% Phase, 60 Hertz +/- 2 Hertz and 20 amp power service. 

3.11.  The contractor shall provide API operating instructional manuals, maintenance manuals, routine repair instructions, and all associated charts, graphs, diagrams, alarm warnings necessary for the safe operation of the API equipment.

3.12.  The API system shall include all hardware, software, and firmware capable of unambiguously identifying the sample throughout the sample aliquot process and maintain the identity of each sample without confusion with other samples.  The API shall provide a method of reading and storing in memory the identity of the sample as part of a defined batch of samples being prepared for testing.  The API shall provide a method of ensuring agreement in specimen identity of the specimen container and receiver test tubes in real time.  

3.13.  The API Security requirements shall include a minimum of 3 groups of access based on user types (USER, SUPERVISOR, SYSTEM ADMIN).  The USER group will allow the operator access to all normal maintenance functions used to prepare the system for operation, access to normal processing operations, and access to maintenance functions needed for system shutdown.  The SUPERVISORY group will include user level access as well as any non-routine functions such as instrument operating parameters.  The SYSTEM ADMIN group will allow the operator access to user and supervisor functions as well as administrative procedures such as software updates and menu access level controls. The SYSTEM ADMIN group will allow the modification of menu access for each of the user types.  For instance, a monthly maintenance function might be added to the user type allowing users access to that screen.  Software and access to key data files shall have password and security level protection.  Data files should be protected only allowing access through the API application.  The software shall allow the operator to log out of the system without stopping operations.  This permits accurate tracking of audit events as the API may have multiple individuals responsible for API operations during the operations.  

3.14.  The API-PC system must use current government approved operating system to run on the network (MS Windows 2000, MS Windows XP Professional).  The API-PC system and software must allow appropriate security patches and operating system service packs to be applied without adversely affecting API operations.  

3.15.  The security features of the API-PC system shall include an audit trail capable of recording operator identity; date and time of operator access; date, time, operator ID, and any edits made to the instrument configurations or to batch ID, specimen ID.  The audit trail information shall be capable of being printed in a report format from the PC.  The contractor shall provide the technical support (such as instrument and interface parameters) necessary to set-up and configure the API system to operate optimally to meet the stated throughput requirements.

3.16.  The API shall be equipped with barcode readers, which can read 3 of 9 andcode 128 barcodes. The API shall read at a minimum a 10-character numeric barcode string placed on the SCC and receiver test tube.  The API shall be able to read positioned barcodes on the SCC with an error rate of less than 5 barcode read errors per 1,000 reads.  In the event of a sample barcode read error, the system shall alarm to alert the operator and continue to process all samples including the sample with the barcode read error.  The data printout shall identify the sample barcode read error, position location and rack identity of the sample cup and companion test tube. The system shall send an error message to the PC or if interfaced, to the LIMS when there is a barcode read error. 

3.17.  The API shall be able to communicate in real time with a PC to record information regarding the run (error reads, etc., are sent to a PC in real time with an audible alarm).  Information regarding specimens processed in the batch (LAN, SCC rack identifier numbers, aliquot rack identifier number, sample position number in aliquot rack) is stored on a PC for possible transfer to the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) after completion of a batch run.  Errors will be indicated in terms of failure to read barcode on bottle, failure to read barcode on specimen tube, error in barcode comparison between bottle and tube.   The PC connected to the API shall be able to print on demand a batch report indicating agreement between LANs on the SCC and specimen receiving tube.  Error codes shall be indicated on any report to explain discrepancies. 

3.18.  The API system shall be safely operable without the operator in direct contact with contaminated or hazardous materials.

3.19.  To ensure no cross contamination during operation of the API, any robotic arms or dispensing station movement shall not cross other SCC or receiver tubes in the course of sample delivery or disposal of used pipette tips.

3.20.  The API system shall be configured to facilitate on-site repair by a laboratory technician to as great extent as practicable and permit reconfiguration of the API to accept system upgrades to improve automation efficiencies within the DoD Laboratories.

3.21.  The API system shall have automated start-up and self check maintenance procedures without an operator having to return to the API to “step” the API through individual instructions/commands/inputs.

3.22.  The contractor shall provide on-site training to personnel at each laboratory site upon installation of the equipment. The extent and number of personnel for the on-site training shall be in accordance with each military drug testing laboratory’s requirements. The contractor shall provide an option to train laboratory personnel to maintain the system at a field engineer level.

3.23.  The contractor shall provide consumable (cleaning reagents, wash solutions, etc.) and disposable supplies (tubing lines, o-rings, gaskets, plungers, etc.) used for the API, either periodically or based upon the volume of testing.  All consumable and disposable supplies shall be provided for one year from the date of system delivery.

3.24.  The contractor shall complete a site survey of each laboratory site prior to API delivery to verify all requirements are available to operate the API system(s) and meet the contractor’s specifications prior to installation.  The contractor shall deliver the API system to a location inside the laboratory, uncrate, setup, and install the API system and demonstrate performance of the system in accordance with Section C (Statement of Work), prior to government acceptance of the system.  The contractor shall provide all cables needed to interface the system to a PC and/or host LIMS.  All extra equipment identified during installation (i.e. uninterrupted power supply (UPS), sump pump, water pump, vacuum pump, waste storage containers, rinse water containers, etc.) or during the first year of operation as needed for optimal operation of the system, shall be provided to the government as part of the original cost submission.

3.25.  The API system shall be supportable (i.e. repair parts, maintenance, etc) for a minimum of 5 years from the date of delivery.

3.26.  The contractor shall have and maintain a Quality Assurance Process.  The Government considers ISO 9000 certification to be an enhancement factor.  

4.  Description of the Specimen Collection Container (SCC) and Collection Kit

4.1.  To facilitate collection, the SCC should have a wide mouth with a maximum diameter of approximately 2 inches with a volume of a minimum of 40.0 ml and a maximum of 110.0 mls.  The SCC that offers ease of urine collection forboth male and female military members while maintaining the forensic integrity of the system will be consider preferable to the Government.  The volume is dictated in part by the diameter of the container, having sufficient depth to prevent splatter during collection, while not of such large volume as to be cumbersome to laboratory processing and storage.  The wide mouth container shall be of sufficient volume: (1) to minimize or eliminate, the need for a separate collection vessel from which urine is manually poured into the SCC for shipment to a military drug testing laboratory and (2) to provide user convenience in urine collection before the need for possible urine flow diversion to a urinal or toilet is required.  The desire for laboratory automation shall not impose inconvenience upon the collection unit.  The specimen container shall be secured by a tamper evident or tamper resistant tape or some other mechanism to identify possible tampering.  The SCC shall be adaptive to the operation of the API and shall consider the requirements of DoD Instruction 1010.16 and Section 1.1 above. 

4.2.  The collection kit shall consist of 12 SCC, 12 well shipping container, and accompanying tamper evident tapes (as needed).  The 12 well cardboard shipping container must meet U.S. Postal and International Air Transport Association (IATA) standards for transport of biological fluids.   

4.3.  As noted in section 1.1. above, the government requires that only one SCC be opened at a time or a suitable alternative to the opening of the SCC be devised.  One alternative method may be the use of a penetration port without the requirement to open the lid of the SCC and does not leave a permanent hole from which the specimen may leak or through which foreign material may enter the SCC.  Other processes will be considered if they adhere to DOD Instruction 1010.16.    

4.4.  If a penetration port is used for entering the container, the port shall be able to withstand a minimum of two sampling entries through the port without the port leaking fluid if the SCC is tipped on its side or inverted for up to one week, or repeatedly frozen and thawed for up to 3 freeze/thaw cycles.

4.5.  The contractor shall be capable of providing the required number of SCC's for approximately 120 thousand specimen collections during the first contract year and to provide an appropriate number of SCC's for approximately 4.5 million specimen collections to support the DoD military drug testing program in subsequent years.  
4.6.  12 well shipping containers will be available as an option and independent line item in the contract.  If special tamper evident tape is required for proper SCC closure it will also be available as an option and an independent line item in the contract.  

5.  Essential Characteristics of the SCC and shipping box.  

5.1.  The SCC shall: 

5.1.1.  Consist of a wide mouth container not to exceed 2 and 1/2 inches in diameter including the container cover.  The opening to the SCC should be maximized for ease of sample collection.  

5.1.2.  Be part of a SCC kit and shall not require or shall minimize the requirement for an ancillary specimen collection container to facilitate specimen collection from male and female military personnel.

5.1.3.  Have a total volume capacity between 40 and 110 ml.  

5.1.4.  Fit within a 12 well shipping box the dimensions of which shall approximate the current shipping box used in the military drug testing program but not exceed 7.5” x 10” x 3.5”.  

5.1.5.  Have a cap closure that will not leak in refrigerator or freezer storage or during routine air courier transport.

5.1.6.  Be compatible for use on the contractor provided automated pipetting device and carrier racks.

5.1.7.  Have sufficient space on the body of the SCC for a 2 in X 4 in bar-coded label containing SSN information and specimen ID information, and sufficient space on the lid or body of the SCC for the application of a bar-coded laboratory accessioning number (LAN) label such that the LAN can be read by the API bar-code reader.  

5.1.8.  Consist of a material that will withstand freezer temperatures down to –20 C and transport temperatures as high as 120 F as may be encountered in hot weather delivery transit.

5.1.9.  Consist of a material that does not bind, or minimizes the adhesion of the tetrahydrocannabinol acid (THC-COOH) molecules to the container.

5.1.10.  Consist of a material clear enough to see the liquid volume.

5.1.11.  Consist of a material and plasticizer that does not leach into the urine to interfere with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) or immunoassays (IA) analysis for drugs of abuse.

5.1.12.  Meet International Air Transport Association (IATA) standards for shipment of biological specimens.

5.1.13.  Withstand cracking or breaking if dropped onto a concrete or tiled floor from a height of approximately three feet.

5.1.14.  If a specialized port or cap is used the vendor must provide a system to easily determine if the port has been tampered with.  Any new tamper evident system must meet be approved by the government.  If tamper evident tape is used it will be provided as part of the SCC kit.

5.2.  The shipping box shall:

5.2.1.  Meet International Air Transport Association (IATA) standards for shipment of biological specimens.

5.2.2.  Use the same closure style as the current shipping box.  If an alternative is offered the government shall evaluate for ease of use and forensic quality in the field and at the laboratory and retains the right to require the contractor provide the current shipping closure style.

 
Technical Evaluation Factors. 

The SCC enhancing factors are significantly more important than the API enhancing factors.

<DESC>The purpose of this project is to deliver two (1) Environmenal Data Quality Assurance (EDQA) course.   The course will be offered in San Antonio and Seattle. The objectives of this course are to introduce Installation Restoration Program (IRP) personnel to the Data Quality Assurance (DQA) process, review relevant statistics that support the process, and engage the students in applying DQA processes to commonly encountered environmental sampling situations.  The use of relevant statistical techniques shall be addressed using the case study method.  Typical environmental sampling situations encountered by IRP personnel include assessing the magnitude, extent, and hazards of environmental contamination in soil, water, groundwater, sites and facilities from past military activities or that may arise as a result of recovery operations after an accident or other emergency response situation.  In addition, IRP offices maintain significant amounts of historical environmental data that must be evaluated using the DQA process.  

1.1  Scope - The scope of this project is to provide training and curriculum materials for applying the DQA processes and related statistical methods to assess and make decisions regarding the magnitude, extent, hazards, and need for environmental sampling.  In addition, the training will include the application of the DQA processes to common sampling situations.  Training will consist of providing a concise student manual that describes guidelines for using the DQA approaches for environmental sampling.  The contractor shall deliver one course to a maximum audience of 25 students each.  This audience will be engineers with degrees ranging from a Bachelor of Science to Ph.D.  Because of the highly skilled nature of the student body, the contractor shall ensure that a recognized Subject Matter Expert (SME) in the field of DQO and DQA conducts the teaching of the statistical lectures.  The contractor shall identify the SME to the USAFSAM/ATO POC at the Technical Interchange Meeting for final approval.  The length of the course is expected to be no more than 5 days.  A tentative schedule is contained in the attachment.  Quality assurance provides applicability to environmental sampling management.  For the quality assurance assessment, the following will be included in the course:  assessment of the data will be performed throughout the scenarios introduced during the DQO process.  Data validation will then be performed either on all data, by including this step with the validation process, or on separate pieces of the data by random selection.  This verification ensures that all quality assurance is properly implemented.  After the data is validated and verified, the assessment is performed.  This process evaluates all known data for the scenario in order to provide additional information to the decision-maker on the risk in making the decision.  After the data assessment is complete the data life cycle output equates to the conclusions drawn from the data.
