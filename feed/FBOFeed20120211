FAR PART 8.405-6(g) 
 
2237 Transaction # or Vista Equipment Transaction #: 402-12-1-101-0001  

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is a brand name, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is restricted to the vendors with this brand name, or equivalent, equipment and is further explained below.  

Restricted to the following source:  Provide original manufacturer's name for material or contractor's name for service.  (If a sole source manufacturer distributes via dealers, ALSO provide dealer information.)

Manufacturer/Contractor: Allsteel Inc.	
Manufacturer/Contractor POC & phone number:  888-255-7833	
Mfgr/Contractor Address: 2210 2nd Avenue, Muscatine, IA 52761-5263	
Dealer/Rep address/phone number: Transco Union Office Solutions, 37 Gabriel Dr., Augusta, ME, Anne Lachance, (207) 485-4190	

1  The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)  AGENCY AND CONTRACTING ACTIVITY:	
Department of Veterans Affairs
1 VA Center
Augusta, ME  04330
(207) 623-8411 ext. 5240
(207 215-3510 (cell)	
VISN:  1
	
(2)  NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED:
VA Maine  Healthcare System is opening a CBOC in Lewiston/Auburn, ME.  As we have standardized the furnishings per  VHA Directive/Handbook 1761.1 Standardization of Supplies and Equipment, the furniture we have been procuring for the last eight (8) years has been cost effective and meets the infection control/ergonomic requirements that we must adhere to with regards to a clinical setting.  We have had numerous brands of furnishings and they do not meet our customer expectations, they are not durable, nor do they meet the infection control requirements.  We have established a committee that evaluates and reviews various healthcare setting furnishings and have not yet met one that can withstand the durability, ergonomic, and endurance of this particular line.  These units are sometimes dismantled and rebuilt based on program changes and have withstood numerous changes or modifications without compromising the integrity of the steel or frame.	

(3)	(a)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEED:
Allsteel workstations, pedestals, and overhead storage units, along with panels and accessories that can be utilized on the Allsteel workstation, i.e. pencil holder, paper wave, tool bar.  	


	(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE:  $
	(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY  DATE:   

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATION OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE.  (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

0	Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).  Describe in detail why only this suggested source can furnish the requirements to the exclusion of other sources.
     	

0	A patent, copyright or proprietary data limits competition.  The proprietary data is:  
     	

1	The material/service must be compatible in all aspects (form, fit and function) with existing systems presently installed/performing.  Describe the equipment/function you have now and how the new item/service must coordinate, connect, or interface with the existing system.
At this time, the workstations/furnishings at the Medical Facility and in the existing and current CBOC's are an Allsteel product.  There are many instances that we must move/modify/relocate units and require the same product line to fulfill these requirements.  We have reviewed and evaluated  other companies with steel/metal furnishings and have not found a company that has the durability and reliability that Allsteel product has.  We have standardized the furnishings per VHA Directive/Handbook 1761.1 Standardization of Supplies and Equipment.	

0	The new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order provided that the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order must not have been previously issued under sole source or limited source procedures. 
     	

0	An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the ordering procedures would result in unacceptable delays. 
     	

(5)  DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:  
This facility has established a committee comprised of Facilities Management staff, Infection Control Nursing staff, Environmental Management staff, Safety Management staff, and a few other various staff members who lend their subject matter expertise in determining what best fits and accommodates the employee, patient, and environment and to date the Allsteel product line has exceeded our expectations based on the fact that we have instances where we must rebuild, dismantle, relocate, or modify/change existing units and this product line lends to making the changes with minimal costs and providing us with a reliable solution for our customers (employees, patients, visitors).	



(6)  DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
We have done much Market Research pertaining to healthcare furnishings and have had vendors bring in products for testing and evaluation.   We have also visited various private hospitals in the local area and have had opportunities to speak with staff about what they have in place and what has worked well for their healthcare environment and what would they do differently or keep the same if needed.	

(7)  ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION:
With the existing product line that we have had in place for the past 8 years, we have little to no complaints pertaining to the quality, durability of the product.  As with other medical facilities, it is not new to us that there are program changes or last minute modifications and with the versatility of this product line, we have been able to accomplish the needs and requirements imposed on us.	
 (8)  A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE:
This facility will continue to investigate any and all product lines pertaining to healthcare furnishings.  We will also continue to visit local hospitals and other medical facilities within VISN 1.  At this time, a new hospital is being built in our city Augusta and we hope to have the opportunity to follow the progress of it's construction and have the opportunity to visit the new medical facility once it is completed to ascertain possible solutions for our facility.
