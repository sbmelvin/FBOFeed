<p><strong>I. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</strong></p>
<p>The Air Force Research Laboratory Munitions Directorate, Contracting Division (AFRL/RWK) is soliciting <span style="text-decoration: underline;">White Papers</span> for the Flight Vehicle Integration Branch (AFRL/RWAV) on the following research effort: Integrated Precision Ordnance Delivery System (IPODS) Phase I concept refinement. It is anticipated approximately two of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">White Papers</span> may be selected for further consideration, and their originators may subsequently be requested to submit formal written technical and cost proposals, with the intent of negotiating approximately two contracts for Phase I of the IPODS Program. However, the Government reserves the right to award one, multiple, or no contracts pursuant to this BAA. Upon completion of Phase I, it is anticipated that a second BAA will be released requesting proposals for the remaining phases (Phase II-weapon development with preliminary testing and Phase III-weapon performance demonstration) of the IPODS Program. For the second BAA, there will be a full and open competition, not limited to the offerors chosen for Phase I.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Introduction:</strong> IPODS serves as a risk reduction program for development of payload delivery technologies needed to attack tunnel targets and hold at risk critical mission areas far down a tunnel behind blast doors. These technologies will also provide alternate payload delivery capabilities in areas to be determined. The challenge is to design a robust suite of technologies that will integrate into a low-cost solution.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Program Objective:</strong> The fundamental objective of the IPODS Program is to develop a prototype for an airborne released, highly maneuverable weapon capable of defeating internal tunnel defenses and targets deep within tunnels. The IPODS shall be compatible with multiple carriages on F-15E, B-52, and B-2 aircraft using existing carriage hardware. Key technical tasks include feasibility studies of the IPODS weapon system, demonstration of the weapon lethality by computations and live static firings, preliminary and detailed design, prototype development, and system functional ground tests.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Technical Requirements:</strong> IPODS technical requirements are listed in the System Requirements Document (SRD), which is found in Annex 1 and technical material, which is found in Annex 2. Certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, is required to be submitted to the Program Manager and the Contract Specialist in order to receive the Annexes. Once a certified DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement, is received, then the contractor will receive access to the Annexes. See paragraph I (9) (d) for further details on how to request the Annexes.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Program Tasking:</strong> The program is anticipated to include three phases. <strong>This BAA pertains to Phase I as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phase I Concept Refinement:</strong> Refer to Section/Paragraph V for evaluation criteria details. See Section/Paragraph II (3) for anticipated Period of Performance. Under Phase 1, the contractor shall:<br />&bull; Identify and develop a weapon system concept based on the IPODS Program Objective and Technical Requirements.<br />&bull; Perform preliminary engineering design trades and system level effectiveness analyses to demonstrate the merit of the concept.<br />&bull; Conduct a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) assessment of the key supporting technologies (e.g. seeker, fuze, guidance and control) and supporting rationale to enable the IPODS concept. <strong>It is anticipated that all data delivered under any resulting award will be delivered with unlimited rights; however different rights may be negotiated as appropriate. The TRL assessment shall be non-proprietary and will be provided for reference in the BAA for Phases II and III.</strong> Identify airframe maneuverability, ability to support the requisite aerodynamic and structural loads consistent with the concepts' method of employment.<br />&bull; Develop a Technology Maturation Test Plan(s). The plan(s) should include priced/prioritized recommendations to mature each of the key technologies. <strong>This plan shall be non-proprietary and will be provided for reference in the BAA for Phases II and III.</strong><br />&bull; <strong>Deliverables:</strong> Final report containing the preliminary IPODS design and Concept of Employment, TRL Assessment, and Technology Maturation Test Plan(s).</p>
<p><strong>(5) Management:</strong> For each contract awarded, the contractor shall be responsible for meeting all requirements, including but not limited to: cost, technical, schedule, and security. The contractor shall communicate the technical and programmatic status through Data Requirements submissions discussed in Section/Paragraph I(6) and scheduled meetings discussed in Section/Paragraph I(7). In addition to the Preliminary Design Review, informal program status interchanges (such as weekly teleconferences) are encouraged.</p>
<p><strong>(6) Data Requirements:</strong> The following data submittals are expected to be required for each contract awarded:</p>
<p>a. Monthly Status Reports (Status Report: DI-MGMT-80368/T)</p>
<p>b. Contract Work Breakdown Structure (DI-MGMT-81334C)</p>
<p>c. Monthly Performance and Cost Report (DI-FNCL-80912)</p>
<p>d. Quarterly Contract Funds Status Report (DI-MGMT-81468)</p>
<p>e. Program Review Material (Presentation Material: DI-ADMN-81373/T)</p>

<p>g. Technology Maturation Test Plan (Test Plan: DI-NDTI-80566)</p>
<p>h. Final Technical Report (Final Reports: DI-MISC-80711A/T)</p>
<p><strong>(7) Meetings and Reviews:</strong> The Government anticipates the following program meetings and reviews: Kickoff within a month of contract start date at contractor's facilities; Technical Interchange Meetings quarterly (and/or as deemed necessary by the Government or contractor) alternating between the contractor's facilities and Eglin AFB, FL; and a Preliminary Design Review at completion of Phase I at Eglin AFB, FL. The contractor may propose to conduct or participate in other meetings with subcontractors, Government agencies, or third parties, as deemed necessary. The contractor should have in place the methods necessary to provide two way secure email transmission between the Government, contractor and all subcontractors, etc. This capability provides for day to day secure email and the transmission of data electronically.</p>
<p><strong>(8) Other Requirements:</strong><br /><strong>a. Program Security Requirements:</strong> Portions of this program will be classified at the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Secret </span>level and a DD Form 254 will apply to the awarded contract. Thus, offerors must verify their Cognizant Security Office information is current with Defense Security Service (DSS) at www.dss.mil . <br /><strong>b. Emissions Security (EMSEC)</strong> requirements will apply. Generation of classified material is authorized only on equipment approved for classified processing by Air Force EMSEC authorities.

Awards may be made without discussions. Factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p><strong>(1.1) Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit - Sub-factors (a) through (c) are of equal importance.</strong><br />(a) Soundness of offeror's proposed IPODS Concept and proposed development<br />(b) Soundness of the offeror's proposed approach to conducting design trade studies<br />(c) Soundness of the offeror's proposed approach to performing assessment studies</p>
<p><strong>(1.2) Factor (2) Capabilities and Experience - Subfactors (a) through (c) in Factor (2) are of equal importance.<br /></strong>(a) Personnel/Management: Experience and capabilities of key personnel (both technical and management); experience and capabilities to manage technical risks, control cost and schedule. <br />(b) Facilities, equipment and techniques necessary to accomplish the project.<br />(c) Subcontract Management: Experience and capabilities to manage subcontractor performance, cost and schedule; nature and extent of reliance on subcontractor. <br /><br />Capabilities and experience may include unique combinations of these subfactors, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives. Experience may be best indicated by work performed on programs of similar scope and complexity within the last 5 years. Any resumes should be in a separate Appendix, which is not included in the White Paper page limits. The Government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>(1.3) Factor (3) Cost</strong> - Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles. Cost/Price is a substantial factor, but ranked as the third order of priority.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Phase 1 Proposal Evaluation Criteria:</strong> Phase1 proposals will be evaluated as to their projected success in achieving the objectives/requirements outlined in Section I, of this BAA, utilizing the Factors and Sub-factors below. Additionally, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">risk assessment</span> (See Section/Paragraph V (3)) will be made of the offers, and selections will be made based on the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Best Value to the Government</span>. Awards may be made without discussions. Factors are listed in descending order of importance. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p><strong>(2.1) Phase 1 Factor (1) Scientific/Technical Merit - Sub-factors (a) through (c) are of equal importance.</strong><br />(a) Soundness and scope of offeror's proposed technical approach and consistency with good systems engineering practices<br />(b) Extent to which the offeror demonstrates that the defined requirements (See Section I (3)) can be accomplished with the proposed technology<br />(c) Scope, traceability and feasibility of proposed analysis and test plans</p>
<p><strong>(2.2) Phase 1 Factor (2) Capabilities and Experience - Subfactors (a) through (c) in Factor (2) are of equal importance.</strong><br />(a) Personnel/Management: Experience and capabilities of key personnel (both technical and management); experience and capabilities to manage technical risks, control cost and schedule. <br />(b) Facilities, equipment and techniques necessary to accomplish the project.<br />(c) Subcontract Management: Experience and capabilities to manage subcontractor performance, cost and schedule; nature and extent of reliance on subcontractor. <br /><br />Experience and capabilities may include unique combinations of the subfactors above, which are integral factors for achieving proposal objectives. Experience may be best indicated by work performed on programs of similar scope and complexity within the last 5 years. Experience should be relevant to the tasks identified in this BAA, to include; design and development of weapon systems, design development and flight testing of weapon systems. The government team may request supplemental historical information if required to confirm/verify experience and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>(2.3) Phase 1 Factor (3) Cost</strong> - Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs. Cost realism includes evaluating if the proposed cost is realistic for the work to be performed, reflects a clear understanding of the requirements, and is consistent with the unique methods of performance and material described in the offeror's technical proposal. The total cost to be evaluated will include the cost of performing the contract, the cost of testing, and any applicable offsets for GFP or acquisition of data rights.</p>
<p><strong>(3) White Paper/Proposal Risk Assessment:</strong> White Paper/Proposal risk will be assessed at each Factor level as part of the evaluation of the above evaluation criteria. White Paper/Proposal risk relates to the identification and assessment of the risks associated with an offeror's proposed approach as it relates to accomplishing the proposed effort. Tradeoffs of the assessed risk will be weighed against the potential payoff. The following definitions will be used during the risk assessment:</p>
<p><strong>(3.1) High:</strong> Likely to cause significant disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Risk may be unacceptable even with special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>(3.2) Moderate:</strong> Can potentially cause some disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Special contractor emphasis and close Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>(3.3) Low:</strong> Has little potential to cause disruption of schedule, increase cost, or degradation of performance. Normal contractor effort and normal Government monitoring will probably be able to overcome difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> No further evaluation criteria will be used. Individual White Paper/Proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other White Papers and Proposals submitted under this BAA.</p>
<p><strong>(5) Review and Selection Process:</strong> Should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">formal proposals</span> be requested based on the evaluation of White Papers, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">those technical and cost proposals</span> will be evaluated at the same time, using the same criteria stated above, and categorized as follows:</p>
<p><strong>(i) Category I:</strong> Proposal is well conceived, scientifically and technically sound, pertinent to the program goals and objectives, and offered by a responsible contractor with the competent scientific and technical staff and supporting resources needed to ensure satisfactory program results. Proposals in Category I are recommended for acceptance (subject to availability of funds) and normally are displaced only by other Category I proposals.</p>
<p><strong>(ii) Category II:</strong> Proposal is scientifically or technically sound, requiring further development and is recommended for acceptance, but at a lower priority than Category I.</p>
<p><strong>(iii) Category III:</strong> Proposal is not technically sound or does not meet agency needs.<br /><br /><strong>VI.

<a href="mailto:robert.hylton@hanscom.af.mil">E-mail the POC</a>
<DESC>The purpose of this effort is to support the Tactical Air Control Party Modernization (TACP-M) requirement by providing a single Universal Serial Bus (USB) IDM interface cable capable of supporting dual channels in order to support digital Close Air Support for Air Force Tactical Air Control Parties. A critical link in the dismounted digital Close Air Support chain of Air Force Tactical Air Control Party is a rugged, small, light weight, and low power portable computer that utilizes a PC Integrated Data Modem (IDM) to interface with Ultra High Frequency (UHF), Very High Frequency (VHF), High Frequency (HF), and SATCOM radios. Currently, the interface between the computers and the Integrated Data Modem is the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) slot. Many computers in this class lack PCMCIA support and eventually the PCMCIA slots will become obsolete as the computer industry is moving to other interface methods.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.106-1) with Medtronic Inc. 710 Medtronic Pkwy, Minneapolis, MN, 55432-5604, as the only responsible source that can provide the External Cardiac Pacemaker Model 5388 as requirement by USNS MERCY.  This acquisition is being conducted under the FAR 13.5 test procedures for commercial items. Provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-24 are incorporated.

USNS MERCY has a need for an External Cardiac Pacemaker.  The Medtronic Model 5388 is a battery-powered, temporary, dual chamber pacemaker designed primarily for temporary anti-bradycardia pacing therapy.  The device provides eight selectable mode of pacing therapy.  This will replace the obsolete functions of the existing pacemakers on the USNS MERCY.  The Medtronic pacemaker continuously monitors the heart to treat bradycardia by sending out a small undetectable electrical signal to restore the heart to a more normal rate.  The USNS MERCY currently has the Medtronic Model 5388 on board, so continuing with the same unit will streamline training and provide better patient care while being in compliance with enhancing Integrated Logistical Support for shipboard applications.  The Government would incur a substantial duplication of cost and patient treatment breakdown to consider other than the Medtronic External Cardiac Pacemaker Model 5388, which is not expected to be recovered through competition.  

Items being purchased in this acquisition:

(5) External Cardiac Pacemaker
	Model: 5388
	
(2) Operators Manuals

(2) Service Manuals


This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures.  There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice shall submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by closing of this notification of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Based on the above information, the only technically acceptable system is provided by Medtronic, Inc.

Submit email capability statements (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Amanda Heller at amanda.heller@med.navy.mil. Fax quotes may be sent to 301-619-1132 Attn: Amanda Heller. Email statements are preferred. Statements are due not later than 4:00 P.M. EST on 29 May 2009. No phone calls accepted.

GRAVEL REQUIREMENTS
Gravel being added to the Salt Creek gravel injection site will meet the following specifications:
Acceptable gravel sources include deposits outside active stream channels at or above the 100 year flood plain, and from the alluvial fan of tributary streams forming the inlets of the Central Valley Project Reservoirs.  Gravel must be uncrushed, rounded natural river rock with no sharp edges.  Gravel shall have the following size requirements: 


Particle Size		Percent Passing	Percent Retained
5"			95-100%		0-5%
2"			75-85%		15-25%
1"			40-50%		50-60%
3/4"			25-35%		60-75%
1/2"			10-20%		85-90%
1/4"			0-5%			95-100%
No gravel shall be smaller than 1/4 inch in diameter.  Gravel shall be completely free of dirt, silt, sand or any other fine particulate material that is less that 1/4 inch in diameter.  In addition, gravel shall be completely free of oils, clay, debris and organic material.  Gravel must be washed at least once and have a cleanliness value of 85 or higher based on CalTrans Test #227.
Gravel delivered to the job site not meeting size and cleanliness specifications will be refused by the Contracting Officer or the COR and will be immediately removed from the job site at the contractor's expense.
Prior to the commencement of the job, the contractor and the COR, will discuss methods that the contractor shall employ at the gravel plant/production source to assure correct sized gravel is delivered to the site and take one sample of the gravel at the gravel plant/production source.  The contractor shall have the gravel tested, by a certified/qualified lab, for both size and cleanliness according to CalTrans Test #227.  Results of testing will be provided to Reclamation prior to job commencement.  During project implementation, the COR and contractor may take random samples of delivered gravel.  Random samples will again be tested, at the contractor's expense, to assure cleanliness and size requirements.
In addition, Reclamation will independently  sample and test gravel for compliance with size gradation and cleanliness specifications.  Sampling and testing will be conducted at a frequency determined by Reclamation to assure gravel specification compliance throgh the entire project's implementation.  
The Contracting Officer or the COR has the right to reject any load of spawning gravel delivered to the job sites that do not appear to meet specification for size and cleanliness.  Any dispute on the acceptability of the spawning gravel shall be resolved by the testing of the spawning gravel in question.  The contractor shall provide the necessary testing and labor to see that the test is performed at no additional cost to Reclamation.
GRAVEL PLACEMENT
At the Salt Creek job site, gravel shall be initially delivered and dumped at the river's edge in the designated area.  The contractor shall provide and operate a front end loader that will push the gravel into the river.  As further loads are delivered, the front-end loader will begin forming a fan shaped terrace, to a height even with the existing bank, out into the river channel.  As the terrace forms and extends into the river, trucks delivering gravel will be required to drive out onto the terrace to dump the gravel.  As the terrace expands it will not exceed approximately one-half the width of the wetted channel or as directed by the COR.
Placement of gravel shall take place between August 31 and September 25, 2009.  Delivery of gravel to the job site will occur Monday through Friday between 7:00 AM and 4:30 PM. No trucks shall access to the job sites prior to 7:00 AM or after 4:30 PM.  The contractor will not work on designated Federal holidays.
The contractor shall deliver between 700 and 1,000 tons of gravel per day to the job site.  Once the job commences, the contractor shall work continuously on weekdays until the job is completed.
Gravel placement techniques must maintain water quality.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format found in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes THE ONLY SOLICITATION; pricing proposals are being requested, and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. The Government is seeking pricing  FOR: Avian Influenza testing of migratory birds is a high priority for Region 7 of the USFWS. The Service has set a goal of sampling individuals of some 26 species of bird species.  Five of the shorebird species, including Dunlin, Ruddy Turnstone, Pectoral Sandpiper, Long-billed Dowitcher, and Buff-breasted Sandpiper, breed on the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk oil fields.  The density and diversity of other shorebirds and the large number of Buff-breasted Sandpiper leks at Prudhoe Bay, especially when coupled with the access provided by the oil field road system, make this an idea location to sample birds for avian influenza.The solicitation number for this request is 70181-9-R159 and the solicitation is being issued as a request for pricing proposals (RFP). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the current Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 05-22) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). 
This is a small business set-aside procurement, however all interested parties are encouraged to respond. This requirement is being advertised under NAICS classification code: 541990. 
WORK DESCRIPTION:  Funds will pay the contractor to capture and sample shorebirds for avian influenza (see detailed products below).  PRODUCTS: The successful contractor will be responsible for managing the project and completing the tasks described below by 30 September 2009.  The contractor will provide the following services and products:(1) Primary objective: Locate nests and display areas, and then capture and sample up to 25 Dunlin, 40 Pectoral Sandpipers, 50 Buff-breasted Sandpipers and five Long-billed Dowitchers for avian influenza (oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs) during the breeding season at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, between 25 May and 7 July 2009.  
(2) Secondary Objective:  Field personnel will also collect feathers and blood samples from all individuals of all species to enable us to determine migratory pathways of shorebirds using genetics and stable isotope techniques.  All individuals will be banded with a U.S. Geological Survey metal band.  For Dunlin, individual birds will also be color-banded to allow resighting of birds in Asia where they winter.
Evaluation:  The successful contractor should be rated based on the following:(1)	Proven track record of gaining access to and working on shorebirds in the Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk oil fields in the past.  This will require a track record of working collaboratively with BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc and ConocoPhillips, and conducting studies of shorebirds on the oil fields.  Such experience will ensure the project begins (i.e., access to the fields is gained) and that the contractor will know where shorebirds are located. (2)	Previous history of successfully collecting avian influenza samples from shorebirds or other birds in the past.(3)	Ability to band shorebirds - this will require the contractor have a staff member that has a Master Banding Permit through the U.S. Geological Survey's Bird Banding Laboratory.

<DESC>This is a Research and Development (R&D) Sources Sought Notice.  This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposals abstracts, or quotations.  The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement. 

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), of the National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate on a non-competitive basis with the incumbent contractor for the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) Data Coordinating Center (the University of Alabama at Birmingham) for the proposed program, Medical Arm for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (MEDAMACS), a registry of advanced heart failure patients identified and followed in parallel to the patients receiving mechanical circulatory support devices collected through the existing INTERMACS program.  INTERMACS is a national registry of patients receiving mechanical circulatory support device (MCSD) therapy to treat advanced heart failure.  It is a collaboration among NHLBI, FDA, CMS, clinicians, scientists, and industry.  To date there are 94 centers participating and over 1500 patients enrolled in the registry. MEDAMACS will provide detailed data on advanced heart failure patients managed without device utilization.  

Background
As many as 600,000 patients in the US have advanced heart failure, and the numbers are rising.  Therapeutic approaches have changed little over the last few years and include: drugs, ICDS, and pacemakers.  Patients, whose heart failure progresses to later stages of the disease, have options limited to medical management, transplantation or MCSD therapy.  The MEDAMACS pilot data will provide a comparator to MCSD patient data collected through INTERMACS, serve to facilitate the refinement of patient selections to enhance clinical management with current devices, and guide and expedite clinical trials for new indications and/or new devices.  

Ambulatory heart failure patients will be identified at selected INTERMACS sites, enrolled and followed.  The program will include Data Coordinating Center support, expert collaborators, and support for up to twelve INTERMACS clinical data collection sites and their collaborating cardiologists.  It is anticipated that the MEDAMACS pilot will accumulate initial data sufficient to show feasibility for a future program.  Data on approximately 40-50 consecutive consenting patients, from 8-10 sites to a total of 400 advanced heart failure patients, will be collected with patients followed-up at specified time points for up to 2 years.  Specific patient eligibility criteria will be defined by an expert working group.

Purpose and Objectives
The broad purpose of this registry pilot is to enable research to determine best medical practices for advancement of public health with respect to the use of standard and MCSD treatment of heart failure.  The pilot registry utilizing the INTERMACS platform will: 1) Develop criteria for participation and identify up to twelve vanguard INTERMACS clinical data collection sites and their collaborating cardiologists; 2) Enroll prospectively a population of ambulatory heart failure patients followed on optimal medical therapy for whom chronic heart failure limits both function and survival to a range where elective implantation of left ventricular assist devices should offer meaningful benefit.  It is anticipated that 40-50 consecutive consenting patients from 8-10 sites to a total of 400 advanced heart failure patients will be collected with patients followed at specified time points for up to 2 years; 3) Establish expert working groups to develop specific patient eligibility criteria, data collection parameters and data elements for heart failure patients not receiving MCSDs; 4) Utilize standard methods consistent with INTERMACS processes to collect and store patients clinical data including related costs; 5) Provide statistical analyses of the data; 6) Evaluate quality of life and functional capacity outcomes and facilitate the refinement of patient selection to maximize outcomes with current devices within approved indications; 7) In association with INTERMACS goals, improve economic outcomes by identifying and optimizing factors affecting cost-effectiveness; 8) Guide and expedite clinical trial planning for new indications and/or new devices including analyzing distribution of integrated functional survival endpoints to determine sample sizes for pivotal randomized trials; 9) Develop and advance a team of emerging clinical investigators in association with collaborating clinical sites who will increase awareness of mechanical circulatory support and serve as role models for other young investigators; 10) Develop a protocol, informed consent and associated Manual of Operations (MOO) documents, and obtain NHLBI approval for these documents. The MOO shall include plans for collecting patient data in compliance with patient privacy regulations, and for proper cross referencing to the source documents.  The protocol shall define time collection points and data elements, among other parameters. The MOO shall include registry policies and procedures, including standard definitions, operating policies such as publications, conflict of interest, and data sharing; 11) Prepare quarterly progress reports and a final progress report and submit to the NHLBI; 12) Arrange meetings/conference calls of the INTERMACS Observational Study Monitoring Board to discuss progress of the MEDAMACS registry; 13) Prepare interim limited access data sets, a final consolidated limited access data set, and a final consolidated copy of patient data in hard copy and computerized tape formats, consistent with NHLBI  policies and provide to the NHLBI; and 14) Work with participating hospitals and the clinical cardiologist collaborators to prepare abstracts and manuscripts for publication.

Anticipated Period of Performance
A cost reimbursement contract with an award date on or about September 30, 2009 and a period of performance for two years is anticipated.

Other important considerations
The data collected through MEDAMACS should be fully compatible with the web-based data collection system currently in place for the INTERMACS program.

Capability Statement
NHLBI is interested in soliciting capability statements from all qualified Offerors demonstrating their ability to perform this research effort. At a minimum prospective Offerors must document capabilities in the following areas which would evidence the potential to successfully complete the work of the registry: 1) Demonstrate past experience in and current capability to perform in collaborative biomedical clinical projects.

<DESC>This contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the University of Hawaii (UH) under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is funding development of a comprehensive web-based ocean wave forecasting tool at the UH School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology (SOEST).  ONR chose SOEST because it offers integrated expertise in Geology and Resources Engineering, and Geophysics, Meteorology, Ocean and Resources Engineering, and Oceanography.  The objective of this tool is to deliver extreme event and multiyear hindcasting for any site around the world, and includes ETOPO 1 (or user defined) bathymetry to allow for coastal refraction.  The immediate deliverable from this subject study is estimates of storm waves at a site associated iwth an actual Navy design project.  But furthermore, and equally importantly, tasking this specifically to the UH provides them and ONR with a valuable real-! world Navy test case regarding the utility of this developmental tool.  The work includes, but is not limited to, performing ocean wave simulation and refraction studies for representative extreme events in the vicinity of the subject site, including statistical evaluation of the results.

<DESC>This Notice constitutes a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in FAR 6.102(d)(2)(i).
The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division - Ship Systems Engineering Station (NSWCCD-SSES), in coordination with the Program Executive Officer, Ships (PEO Ships) and the Amphibious Warfare Program Office (PMS377) is seeking support and information from interested sources toward the development of the Ship-to-Shore Connector (SSC).  The SSC is the future Air Cushion Vehicle (ACV) craft for transporting vehicles and cargo from the ship to shore.  It is also the planned replacement craft for the current Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC).  The SSC will provide high speed, over the horizon, heavy lift capability to transport the personnel, equipment, and material of the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB) as established for year 2015.  
The SSC is in the Technology Development Phase and has finished a Government led Preliminary Design.  Milestone A was achieved in May 2009 and a Capabilities Development Document (CDD) is being prepared and is expected to be approved in FY09.  Government led Contract Design effort will begin in Q3 FY09 and conclude in FY10.  Award of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) type contract/s for Detail Design and Construction (DD&C) is expected in FY11.   
The SSC will have, at a minimum, the ability to operate in the well deck of existing and planned U.S. Navy amphibious ships; operate with Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) and MPF Future (MPF(F)) ships; operate over beaches, ice, mud, and marsh areas; operate in inland regions; and transport a cargo load of 74 Short Tons.
Requirements for the SSC are not finalized and are currently being developed in the CDD.  However, participants should assume that the SSC must have capability and performance equivalent to, or exceeding, that of the SLEP LCAC craft.  
An SSC information website has been created to keep industry informed of the latest releasable information on the program.  Each company is limited to one seat at no cost to them.  In order to request corporate website registration, send an email request to Tom Murphy (thomas.j.murphy32@navy.mil) with the subject heading "SSC Industry Website Registration Form Request".

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>In Accordance with FAR 6.302-1, and under the authority of 41 USC 253(c)(l), the General Services Administration, Public Building Service, Fort Worth Service Center, intends to solicit the six known local installers of Notifier Fire Alarm Systems in the Dallas/Fort Worth area for a competitive procurement, on an Other Than Full and Open basis.  The Governments requirement is for the replacement of the Earl Cabell Federal Buildings Fire Alarm System at 1100 Commerce Street, Dallas, Texas with a Class B Notifier Fire Alarm System to be installed by a certified Notifier installer.  This a firm requirement based on the fact that the connected federal building has recently been equipped with a Notifier brand firm alarm system.  In order to be able to connect, interface, and communicate between the alarm panels and systems, components need to be from the same manufacturer to assure inter-operability and compatibility.  Notifier manufactured equipment, like virtually all fire alarm systems on the market, are proprietary in nature, to include both hardware and software components.  They require the use of manufacturer certified installers.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination to provide for other than full and open competition is within the sole discretion of the Government.

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 150%"><span style="font-size: 8.5pt; line-height: 150%; font-family: Arial;">Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) requires the use of the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as a part of the proposal submission process. ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov. In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer. Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein. Offerors are strongly encouraged to register to receive notification of upload the RFP at this site and register on the Interested Vendor List (IVL). Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading the solicitation and monitoring the website for amendments if any to the solicitation.</span></p>

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation Notice identifying an upcoming requirement to identify testing laboratories capable of evaluating personal cooling items for dismounted Soldiers.   A wide range of technologies have been promoted as possible solutions to Soldier cooling requirements in extreme environments.   Several programs have been funded to improve the performance of these technologies.  There is a critical need to test and evaluate these cooling systems quickly and accurately.  This synopsis is intended to notify potential offerors of an upcoming solicitation which will serve to identify laboratories that have the inventory, capabilities and time to evaluate these systems.  The test laboratories must be familiar with thermal manikin testing, human subject testing as well as the following test standards but not limited to ASTM standards F1291, F2300 and F2371.  Laboratories must be able to have dedicated thermal manikins, chambers, equipment and staff for this project.  The period of performance for this study will be one (1) base year and four (4) option years.<BR><BR>Laboratories must have the capability to evaluate the cooling items and come to conclusions based on sound scientific principles.  Laboratories must be capable of measuring the heat removal rate and cooling duration of a selected personal cooling system.  For applicable human subject testing, laboratories must be able to monitor Soldier (or subject) heart rates, core temperatures, sweat rates, oxygen consumption rates, metabolic rates and skin temperatures.  Laboratories must be capable of controlling the lab environment which includes - temperature, humidity, solar load as well as air circulation.  Laboratories must be responsive to ad hoc testing and be able to ensure that equipment will be accessible in a reasonable amount of time for testing.

<DESC>This Market Survey supereceds Market-Survey-4537-1<BR><BR>FOR QUESTIONS PLEASE REFER TO THE TECHNICAL CONTACT Ivy M. Scott scottfouche@us.army.mil  <BR><BR>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: This announcement constitutes an official Requests For Information (RFI).  This is a request for information only, as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The intent is to identify market interest and solicit recommendations for a performance-based acquisition strategy that focuses on supply-chain management in support of the BETSS-C spare parts.  A future solicitation/contract would provide performance-based driven support and management services for CECOM managed BETSS-C spare parts located worldwide.  This is not a Requests For Proposals (RFP), or an Invitations For Bids (IFB), nor is it to be construed as a commitment by the government.  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  An Industry Day will be held 11 June 2009 0900-1600 for those interested parties seeking additional information.  Questions from interested parties, to be answered during Industry Day, must be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after release of this RFI.  <BR><BR>BACKGROUND: <BR>RDISS Description: RDISS is a fixed surveillance system that can be quickly installed with minimal training and provide the warfighter situational awareness in those activities immediately outside protective barriers.  RDISS consist of two Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras with IR illumination capability and eight fixed cameras monitored from a dual-processor workstation.  Fixed cameras have IR sensitivity for high-quality images at night and video capability of 45 frames per second at 640 X 480 resolution.  The PTZ camera provides 18x optical zoom, continuous auto zoom, 60m active IR illuminator and 360-degree continuous rotation.  The workstation supports 24-hour continuous recording with video files that can be saved and stored for later analysis.  A single Soldier can monitor 10 or more cameras at one location.<BR>FPS Description: The system includes PTZ cameras, the EOSS 250TC integrated thermal imaging system, an AN/PPS-5C Man-Portable Surveillance and Target Acquisition Radar (MSTAR), and Battlefield Anti-Intrusion System (BAIS) Unattended Ground Sensors UGS to detect enemy activity. All of these sensors are connected to the Tactical Automated Security System for command and control.  However, spare parts for MSTAR and BAIS will not be covered under this RFI. <BR>Cerberus Description: Cerberus consists of a trailer-mounted tower with multiple detection and assessment systems, all self-contained on a single mobile platform. Cerberus uses three detection sensorsground surveillance radar (GSR), video motion detection on staring cameras, and optional UGS. Cerberus has two system configurations (standard- and long-range) to provide the Warfighter the flexibility to adjust to a variety of terrains, threats, and missions. <BR>Multiple towers can be netted for control and annunciation to a Common Operating Picture (COP). Networking multiple towers allows an operator to observe the entire perimeter through an easily understood display.  The alarm and assessment data are presented automatically on the display through data overlays and pop-up windows. <BR>Regardless of system configuration, all variants are integrated onto a MIL-STD Generator Trailer that is HMMWV towable and sling-load-certified. Each self-contained system uses MIL-STD HMMWV battery power and an on-board MIL-STD 3.0 KW diesel generator (or commercial line power) to automatically recharge the batteries.<BR><BR>OBJECTIVE: Currently, all spare parts of the above systems will be included in this RFI (Bill of Materials will be provided upon request).  All spare parts are consumable items and are currently maintained by Forward Support Representatives (FSR) in theater.  The intent of the RFI is to provide a forum to identify opportunities to provide a performance-based approach for the acquisition of these spare parts.  An approach that focuses on supply-chain management, requisition wait time, sustainment readiness; and sustainment costs without adding a strain to the Warfighter.  The strategy must also provide visibility to the CECOM Life Cycle Management Command (CECOM LCMC).  Management of suppliers and spare parts within the BETSS-C supply-chain (including forecasting, stock, store, issue and transportation) will be addressed.  Disclaimer: This Market Research and RFI is for planning purposes only, and shall not be considered a RFP or IFB; an obligation from the U.S. Government (USG) to acquire any products or services; or an authorization to incur any cost in anticipation of such authorization.  This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or reimburse respondents for information solicited.  This information is subject to change and in no way binds this office to pursue any course of action described herein.  If this office chooses to issue a RFP at a future date, another notice will be published. <BR>Partnerships are acceptable and encouraged as long as a single point of accountability for supply-chain management is identified.  If the proposed acquisition strategy utilizes or partners with organic entities such as Army Depots or the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) as a source of supply, then an explanation is required on how these organizations will be used.  The proposed acquisition strategy may consider, but it is not required, the use of FAR 51.000 for the use of DLA as a source of supply.    <BR><BR>RESPONSES: Response will be a 3 step process.  The first step is to inform the Government in writing (see SUBMISSION INFORMATION below), within 20 calendar days after the RFI release date, of interest in this performance-based effort and submission of written questions to be answered at Industry day.  The second step will be participation in the question and answer session at the Industry Day.  The final step is the submission of a written response to this RFI no later than 20 calendar days after Industry day.  Submission shall be limited to 25 one-sided pages.

The strategy should include, but is not limited to, forecasting methods (including ramp-up and draw-down in response to surge requirements), locations to stock, store, issue parts, potential partnerships (commercial and government), and transportation methods (for CONUS and OCONUS).  Also, include any foreseen constraints and/or issues that may arise with a performance-based acquisition strategy.  <BR>(C)	Metrics: Propose methods to create and maintain a metrics database for monitoring the performance of the contract.  Discuss how metrics can be used to promote an incentive based contract award and propose a reporting method that ensures transparency and accountability.  <BR>(D)	Supply Chain Management Knowledge and Experience: Express any knowledge of the identified BETSS-C systems that would demonstrate a technical/logistics capability to support the supply-chain management of the spare parts.  Demonstrate extensive experience and successful track record in sustainment and supply chain management services both for individual systems and within a systems of systems or family of systems framework such as BETSS-C. Also, demonstrate experience and knowledge with providing supply chain services with a quantity of varying individual components or products comparable to BETSS-C (reference BETSS-C Bill of Materials). <BR>(E)	Interoperability: Propose a method that ensures the interoperability of provided spares covered under this RFI with the original and change management strategies necessitated by possible modifications in future configurations.  Focus on the maintaining system reliability and compatibility and demonstrated knowledge and experience in configuration control, specifically in regard to sparing and supply chain management.  <BR>(F)	Cost: Vendor should provide a Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Cost of its recommended performance-based acquisition strategy.<BR>SUBMISSION INFORMATION: RFI responses shall be submitted no later than 20 calendar days after Industry day to US Army CECOM LCMC, IEW&S Directorate, Attention: Ivy M.

<DESC>RECOVERYTHIS ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO BE FUNDED BY AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT FUNDS.<BR><BR>The project includes the installation and testing of a subsurface seepage management barrier augmented with an injection/extraction well system, located near the barrier, adjacent to a window area.  The barrier will have approximate dimensions of 60-80 feet in depth and 1,000 feet in length.  The seepage barriers exact length and depth will be determined using detailed field data. It is anticipated that installation of the seepage barrier may prove difficult due to subsurface geologic conditions at the project area.  Subsurface conditions consist of limestone sequences characterized by variable hardness qualities, which have undergone secondary dissolution. The method of installation may require creative excavation and installation techniques. Other project work includes installation of monitoring wells with heat-pulsed flowmeters, constructing a 10-ft by 12-ft control building to house electrical controls and panels, completing electrical work and utility coordination with FP&L and AT&T, construction of well pumps and discharge piping system, constructing walkways for westward well access, and improving the bench area for site access. Access to the project site could be from State Rd 997 (Krome Ave.) and/or from U.S. Highway 41 (Tamiami Trail) by S-334 or S-356.  The staging area for trailers and equipment is primarily east of S-334 and north of L29 canal as shown on the drawings.  The Magnitude of Construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.

<a href="mailto:acss@usmc.mil">All responses shall be forwarded to:</a>
<DESC>RFI --The Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC) intends to augment their existing pool of technical and analytical services contractors for FY10.  This notice provides information for both current and new vendors wishing to participate in the Command's Commercial Enterprise Omnibus support services (CEOss) business model, established in August, 2002.   To date, $1.8+ billion in task order awards have been accomplished ranging from $100K to $27.7 million.   CEOss is predicated upon Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 8.404, which authorizes agencies to issue Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) with Federal Supply Service (FSS) contractors.  There are currently thirty-three (33) competitively awarded active BPAs established with contractors using approved FSS schedules aligned along four (4) competency-based domains.
CEOss Open Season allows current prime contractors to reconstitute their existing teams to respond to anticipated FY10 Command requirements.   Additionally, CEOss assesses the need for new prime vendor awards in selected domains.   For FY10, openings are anticipated in two domains, ALA and BA; unrestricted as to business size.  However, in accordance with small business goals established for Department of Defense, beginning FY10 CEOss small business subcontracting (or prime) requirement of a minimum of 10% at the BPA level.  A preparatory workshop will be held for those firms interested in participating as new CEOss prime vendors on 01 June 2008, 0900 - 1110, which will provide detailed information about Command requirements and RFI submission guidance.  Attendance is limited to two (2) representatives per company and attendance may be restricted due to space constraints.   The workshop will take place in Quantico, Virginia at the Gray Research Center.
CEOSS BACKGROUND INFORMATION:  The CEOss model relies exclusively on paperless, e-procurement transaction processes to compete all requirements among qualified domain prime vendors.   Individual Task Orders are competitively awarded to BPA contractors within these respective domains.   There is no maximum dollar limit on any task order, nor any minimum order amount assigned to the BPAs.   There are four (4) domains within the CEOss model:  Specialty Engineering (SE), Business and Analytical (BA), Engineering and Scientific (ES), and Acquisition, Logistics and Administrative (ALA).   Vendors are required to identify the domain for which they would like to be considered for a prime BPA and only one submission per vendor is allowed.    To qualify for consideration in the ALA domain you must possess a MOBIS (874), PES (871), or LOGWORLD (874 V) schedule.   To qualify in the BA domain, you must possess a FABS (520), MOBIS (874), or Training Aids & Devices, Instructor-Led Training! , Course Development, Test Administration (69) schedule.   To qualify in the SE domain, you must possess a MOBIS (874), PES (871), Environmental Services (899), IT Services & Support (70), or Lab Testing & Analysis (873) schedule.  To qualify in the ES domain, you must possess a MOBIS (874), PES (871), or IT Services & Support (70) schedule.  Although vendors may have a prime BPA award in only one of the four domains, teaming and subcontracting relationships across the domains are unrestricted.    
INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW CEOSS APPLICANTS:    To be considered for a CEOss prime BPA, interested vendors must submit the following information NLT 17 June 2009.   A capabilities statement, limited to five (5) pages, that identifies their firm's capabilities within a domain of prime interest (limited to domains open for this season, ALA and BA), to include business size, team composition, business/management strategy, relevant experience, and rate discounting policy.  In addition, a copy of their applicable GSA Schedule shall also be included in the submission.  All material should be submitted on one (1) CD-ROM along with one (1) hard copy.   All business sizes will be considered for the domain openings.   However, based upon responses to this Request for Information (RFI), ACSS will determine if there is viability in pursuing restricted competition in any of the open domain(s), however the RFI does not guarantee award of any BPA in any or all domain(s).   Vendor submissions wil! l be matched to domain (i.e., Command) requirements to establish a baseline that considers each firm's pricing and technical capabilities within the existing pool of domain participants.   
Vendors determined to offer the best "fit" within each domain, respective of price and services offered, will have the opportunity to respond to a formal solicitation that will be issued NLT 10 July 2009.   Responses will be due NLT 31 July 2009, inclusive of teaming arrangements, unless otherwise stated in the formal solicitation.

<DESC><p>Intent to Sole Source: <br />The Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security-Office of Inspector General (DHS-OIG), intends to negotiate a sole-source procurement with Global Com, Inc for installation, testing, and integration of the agency's Protective Distribution System (PDS) with the Interceptor in Washington, DC. <br />

The vendor [Global Com, Inc] is the only Certified Vendor that has performed the DHS firmware upgrade and has operational experience with the Interceptor using the DHS firmware. Additionally the Interceptor must be integrated to DHS automation equipment for event notification and Global Com, Inc is the only company that has the knowledge and experience in performing this integration. Global Com, Inc is also the only company which has successfully installed and currently maintains the existing Interceptors for DHS.</p>
<p>The Bureau of the Public Debt will consider all affirmative responses received no later than May 29, <br />2009. Affirmative responses shall be accompanied by sufficient documentation to clearly show the ability to provide the requirements. A request for more information will not be considered an affirmative response. If no affirmative written response is received that clearly demonstrates the ability to meet all the requirements, we intend to negotiate a sole-source award to Global Com, Inc. If you would like a copy of the Sole Source Justification, please e-mail your request.</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATIONU. S. Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition AcademyDate of Issue:  		May 20, 2009Date of Response:  	June 8, 2009Respond to:  		Brian Johnson, Contract Specialist	        	        Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Academy7485 New Horizon WayFrederick, MD 21703Phone: (202) 461-07651.0	Purpose of RFIThe purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit innovative solutions from qualified IT solutions providers for the design, installation, technical support and service maintenance of the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs Acquisition Academy (VAAA) classrooms in Frederick, MD.  The goal is to provide each student with a stable minimum maintenance network to run simultaneously throughout the academy.  At full capacity, there will be approximately 1,000 students that will need this service.  Approximately half will be located in Frederick, MD and the remainder will be distance-based.  	1.1  Background and ObjectivesFounded in 2008, the VA Acquisition Academy (VAAA) currently houses approximately 100 employees and 5 classrooms that can each hold 30 students.  Currently classrooms are equipped with SMARTboards, LCD projectors, VTC capability and DVD players all connected to an LCD projector.  This technology is deemed adequate, but the VAAA is open to alternatives.  The VAAA's current classroom desktop solution is for each student to have a laptop computer at their desk.  It has been determined that the laptop solution is not optimal for several reasons: 1) IT support and maintenance for this many laptops is to maintenance intensive and will only become more intensive as additional classrooms are added; 2) the mobility of laptops is a security risk to the VA; 3) they utilize an inordinate amount of desk space when students are performing non-IT related tasks; and 4) the abundance of wires that are obtrusive. 2.0	SpecificationsSee attached floor plan for our future build-out to accommodate these extra classrooms.  There will be a total of 16 classrooms (some housing 24 students and some housing 30 students), 2 business centers (housing 5-10 students) and 20 break-outs rooms (housing 6-8 students each) that will need full IT services. These IT services to include; running multiple applications simultaneously, shared network capability, internet access, and video teleconference technology.  The VAAA is looking to have interchangeable classrooms equipped with IT solutions and also the flexibility of a clear work surface for traditional classroom tasks as well as clear sight lines for unobstructed interaction.The VAAA will have three types of students, VA employees, employees of other federal agencies and distance based synchronous/asynchronous students.3.0	RequirementsThis will be a performance-based acquisition and we are looking for a solution that adds the best value to the Government.  This solution may be purely IT or IT and furniture combination.4.0  Response Structure1.  Title Page- The Vendor shall provide a title page providing the Vendor's name and address, telephone number, email address and contact person. 2.  Executive Summary- The Vendor shall provide a one page summary of the response including pertinent points and highlights.3.	Vendor Qualifications- The Vendor shall provide a summary of its qualifications to provide the services being proposed.  The Vendor shall provide references of similar organizations to the VAAA that are being provided with service similar to that being proposed to the VAAA.4.	Proposed Solution- The proposed solution shall be created based upon theinformation provided within this document.

Entered data are retained in a database to support querying and report generation. The user can generate an output Word document suitable for entry into DARRTS.

The prototype has been implemented in Microsoft Web Developer. The production tool should use ColdFusion. The backend database in the prototype is SQL Server. Other options for the database will be considered.

The tool operates in a secure environment, so you can obtain the user name from the users Windows login. His review division (in this case, HFD-110) comes from a local database table.

Pending work (IND/Submission) should come from the administrative database (DARRTS). How to do that will need to be negotiated with CDER Office of Business Process Support. (The pilot uses a local database table.) Some information (sponsor, dates) should also be obtainable from the administrative database (DARRTS).

User-entered data are organized in a series of tabs (Admin, Design, Comparators, etc.; see Figures 1, 3-6). Content and layout, etc. for the form are described in a local database table (Metadata; see Tables 2 and 3).

User form control types are limited to free text or numbers, drop-down lists, and three-state (yes/no/no answer; here implemented with a set of radio buttons). Free text does not require rich text formatting.

Every form control has explanatory float-over text (Metadata.Tooltip).

Every form control has an associated optional note.  The notes use embedded Word to support arbitrary formatting. (All users will have Word installed.) In the final output report, the user can have a note appear as either a footnote or in parentheses.
For the most part, one protocol review has one value for each form control. This model breaks down for describing a studys end points. The contractor will need to do further requirements gathering so that a solution can be crafted that captures multiple endpoints, their relationships among one another, and the data elements associated with an individual end point. This should still be implemented as metadata, so that further enhancements are possible. The pilot implementation went to XML for endpoints; perhaps the entire form metadata ought to be XML.

Upon attempt to generate a filable report, the system executes a set of validation rules, stored in Metadata. Some rules enforce database constraints on data types, range, or nullability (see Metadata.IsRequired, Metadata.Choices). Other rules require responses to a set of form controls depending upon another response. For example, if the study enrolled women, then you must answer questions about enrollment criteria regarding pregnancy (see Metadata.RequirementSet.)

Some rule violations prevent report generation. The user should be prompted to where those problems are (link from error message to Tab and form control). Some rules should generate warning messages (for example, a large study enrollment with no statistical consult indicated).

All database transactions occur through stored procedures.

The report output should be controlled through a Word template. The default should be a standard, centrally managed template, but a reviewer should be able to substitute a template of his own.

The report generator should support some macro expansion that substitutes form values into the output and enables proper English. 
The reviewer can view a summary of previously reviewed protocols for the same IND application (History tab). The generated Word report should have a summary of previously reviewed protocols.

A partially functional Web Developer prototype is available for perusal, but specific details do not need to match the prototype.

We may anticipate a labor hour type contract with a base year plus one option year.

<DESC>Description:  	Service for Animal Studies in the Pandemic Flu Project

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of small businesses (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses) for service for animal studies in the Pandemic Flu Project.

This information is being sought for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  No official solicitation exists; therefore, please do not request a copy of a solicitation.  If in the future an official solicitation is released, there is no guarantee that sources responding to this will be included on the source list.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted.  FDA may consider soliciting services for a one year contract.

Objectives:

The ultimate goal of this project is to complete animal studies in the Pandemic Flu Project.   In the past few years, H5N1 strains of avian influenza have been shown to infect poultry in several parts of Asia and a highly pathogenic form for humans emerged in 1997.  Human infections of this virus have been identified since then.  Unlike other influenza viruses, H5N1 exhibits a wide range of unique pathologic features including hypercytokinemia, hemophagocytosis and neurologic involvement in some cases suggesting that pathogenesis and modes of spread of this virus may be different than seasonal flu strains.  The potential for transmission of pandemic flue through blood transfusion and blood products is not known.  H5N1 has been detected in blood of persons acutely infected with H5N1 virus using sensitive PCR methods.  The possibility of a viremic period, before the onset of clinical symptoms and/or after symptom resolution, remains an important concern regarding blood safety.  This knowledge gap in transfusion safety needs to be addressed in order to understand the infectivity of H5N1 in blood.  Results from appropriate animal model studies could provide insights into the viremic period following H5N1 infection using an animal model that could help define a deferral period after exposure to pandemic influenza strains.

Draft Scope of Work:

This is an amendment to an existing contract which included a study with 32 mice and a study with 24 ferrets, each at two dose levels, has been completed.  For the in vitro part, the following samples will be analyzed.

1.	Mouse Study
EID 50 of all lungs, spleen, brain, nasal turbinates and ileum (32 x 5 samples) 
RNA blood (88 samples)
EID50 of blood samples (27 samples)
RNA of lung (8), nasal turbinate (14) and brain (14) (14 each x 2 = 28 + 8 = 36 samples (including re-cutting of samples for RNA processing)

2.	Ferret Study
EID50 of 43 blood samples of 12 ferrets
EID50 of 43 nasal wash, 12 lungs, 12 brains and 12 nasal turbinates (total = 122)
RNA blood (144 samples)
RNA of 47 + 7 tissues (12 lungs, 12 nasal turbinates, 12 brains and 11 spleen and 7 extra for verification)


We may anticipate a labor hour type contract for one year. 

Viable parties shall provide the following:

Part A. Capabilities and Technical Experience  Provide a capability statement describing how your company would provide animal studies in the Pandemic Flu Project as provided in the Draft Scope of Work.

Part B.  Size of Business- Please provide your business size and submit copies of any documentation such as letters or certificates to indicate the firms status.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency has a requirement for a follow-on contract for the Airborne Sensor (ABS) Program for the operation and sustainment of the MDA airborne sensors and platforms used to support the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) test program and its elements. The current contract, FA8632-05-D-0244, is a single award, cost plus award fee, Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite-Delivery (IDIQ).  We anticipate the follow-on to be a five-year basic contract with five one-year options commencing in February 2010.

The contractor will be required to have an environmentally controlled space for three Gulfstream IIs, one DC 10-10, and support equipment.  Facilities to store ABS sensors and sensor integration hardware will also be required.   The contractor will be required to perform mission operations, aircraft test operations, and aircraft maintenance.  Airborne sensor systems currently operated by MDA are the High Altitude Observatories (HALO I, II, & III) and the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP) aircraft.  As future requirements emerge, MDA may add additional aircraft, additional sensors, develop new sensor systems, and/or modify sensor/mission support systems onboard the current aircraft.  This may include longer endurance aircraft, additional communications capabilities, and telemetry applications.  

Operations and sustainment of all current and future MDA test airborne sensor platforms will be required.  Support requirements include the planning and execution of all aspects of sensor systems and aircraft operations.  Effort will focus on the successful conduct of flight test missions. Operations activities may include, but are not limited to, program management support, aircraft support, mission support, sensor systems engineering support, and data reduction and analysis support.  Additional activities may include system improvement and modernization, aircraft modifications, and technology development.  Maintenance and operation of all aircraft will be in accordance with DCMA Instruction 8210, and all future aircraft modifications must comply with MIL HDBK-516B.

Current government furnished equipment (GFE) platforms include two Gulfstream IIBs, one Gulfstream IISP, and one DC 10-10, though additional aircraft may be added.  At the time of award, all aircraft will be certified airworthy.  Details for each aircraft are as follows:

The HALO-I is a Gulfstream IIB aircraft with multiple sensors viewing through optical windows, used for data collection in the visible through long wave IR (LWIR) spectral regions.  Four sensor stations accommodate a mix of user-defined sensors in three gimbaled mirror pointed platforms and one fixed mirror pointed platform.

HALO-II is also a Gulfstream IIB aircraft with a cupola mounted atop the fuselage that allows for open port viewing with a multiband sensor system to collect radiometric and photo documentation data in the visible through LWIR spectral regions. HALO-II also allows for window viewing by cabin sensors.  

HALO-III is a Gulfstream IISP aircraft that serves as the Airborne Diagnostic Target (ADT) for the Airborne Laser Program.  It includes a wing mounted sensor pod, plume emulator, target board, various beacon lasers, and ADT system control and situational awareness hardware.

WASP is a DC-10 aircraft modified with three pressure vessels to allow open port or closed cabin optical window sensor viewing.  WASP will accommodate a Prime Sensor System (PSS) for data collection and guest captive-carry seeker/sensor systems.  The WASP PSS is similar in design and capability to the HALO-II primary sensor.

The intended outcome of this synopsis is to determine interest and capability in supporting the Airborne Sensor Program and to identify acquisition alternatives that may warrant further study and review.  

MDA is requesting contractors interested in this acquisition to submit a capability statement.  Capability statements (no more than 10 pages) need to demonstrate core capabilities and expertise in each of the following areas: 

1.	Operation and sustainment of a wide range of electro-optical and infrared (EO/IR) sensor suites with data collection capability from ultra-violet (UV) through the LWIR spectral regions. 
2.	Operation and sustainment of aircraft systems to provide all aircraft-related services to include all aircraft operations, maintenance, modification, flight and ground crew support personnel, facilities and aircraft flight worthiness and flight safety certifications;.
3.	Airborne test measurement operations, optical signature data collection, tactical communications, and processing of the raw data into radiometric calibrated test data or other forms as required by the user.
4.  Airborne and ground based voice and data communications including line-of-site, UHF DAMA Satcom, INMARSAT, TADL-J, Link-16, JTIDS, and standard air traffic control (ATC) communications.
5.	Mission planning and execution to include pre-mission planning and analyses, sensor selection and integration and calibration, post-mission data reduction, data reviews, and data analysis support.

6.	Coordination with national and other test ranges both CONUS and OCONUS, including logistics related to aircraft operations and sensor systems operations, communications, test planning and organization.
7.	Overall planning, management, and execution of test missions to meet all test objectives.
8.	Similar activities to conduct non-test operational missions, as required. 
9.	Additional aircraft and/or sensor engineering support to include aircraft/sensor system and/or component development, acquisition, modifications, integration, operations and maintenance, and capability upgrades and improvement as required.  
10.	Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) testing and other related missile system testing.
11.	Flight testing at ranges of interests to MDA including national ranges, foreign ranges, and other ranges where BMDS testing could occur.

Contractors are also encouraged to submit acquisition strategy alternatives.  The acquisition strategy will be developed based upon the technical capabilities and solution sets offered as a result of this synopsis.    Alternatives under review include:

1.	Segregating the program into distinct contracts with periods of performance tentatively starting in February 2010.
2.	Using a single prime contractor for all effort.
3.	Awarding one contract for the Gulfstream effort and another contract for the DC-10 effort.
4.	Other acquisition alternatives and suggestions offered by industry.

Acquisition alternatives should be in white paper/thesis format on 8.5x11, single sided, minimum font of 12 pitch and not more than 10 pages in length.  Fold out charts for tables or graphics will count toward the page limit.  The follow-on acquisition draft statement of work and the current contract CLIN structure are provided for your review and comment.  For Official Use Only guidelines for receiving, handling, and destroying the material apply.  Respondents are encouraged to address affordability improvements as part of any response.

Submit all responses to Belinda Williams at belinda.williams@mda.mil no later than 14 days after publication of this announcement.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability and capability of potential sources (including certified 8(a), Small Disadvantaged, and HUBZone firms; veteran and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and women-owned small businesses). This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposals, Solicitation, Request for Quotes, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The Government does not reimburse respondents for any cost associated with submission of the information being requested or reimburse expenses incurred to interested parties for responses to this sources sought. Any responses received will not be used as a proposal. 

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking to identify any sources with strong relationships and resources with the state government of Mississippi and the capabilities or prior experience in education and training services, which include curriculum development and maintenance, research program development, program evaluation, and instruction to support and further this SIDS project.  

STATMENT OF WORK: 

I. 		Background 
The national Back to Sleep public health education campaign was launched in 1994 after the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended back sleeping as the safest sleep position for infants under one year of age to reduce the incidence of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).  The campaign promotes placing babies on their backs to sleep and is led by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes of Child-Health and Human Development (NICHD) in collaboration with the campaign sponsors:  Health Resources and Services Administrations (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), the AAP, First Candle/SIDS Alliance, and the Association of SIDS and Infant Mortality Programs (ASIP).

Since the launch of the campaign, the SIDS rate has continued to drop.  However, despite the overall success of the campaign, the SIDS rate in African American infants is still two times higher than in white infants.  Several studies have shown that African American infants are placed on their stomachs to sleep more often than other infants.  Stomach sleeping is a major risk factor for SIDS.  

The NICHD, HRSA/MCHB, and partner organizations developed the Resource Kit for Reducing the Risk of SIDS in African American Communities to help organizations initiate SIDS risk-reduction programs in their local serving communities.  Many projects emerged for the African American outreach initiative as a result of the focused effort put forth by partners to reduce the risk of SIDS.  These projects have included health fairs throughout the state of Mississippi, trainings in churches and community health forums, the Mississippi statewide October SIDS Awareness month and partnerships with the Mississippi SIDS Alliance and Mississippi Department of Health.  

The Mississippi SIDS African American Outreach Project intends to continue to build strategic alliances of service organizations and their community affiliates, research scientists, and public health and elected officials to achieve specific, measurable health objectives by diffusing evidence-based SIDS risk-reduction information to communities across the state.  NICHD intends to grow its outreach efforts by building upon the infrastructure of the project to capitalize on the relationship with the State of Mississippi and preferably a state-supported Historically Black College/University (HBCU) in the Jackson area.  

II. 		Purpose and Objectives
The purpose of this project is to expand and improve coordination and delivery of SIDS risk-reduction information to pregnant and parenting women, their families, and other care givers of infants younger than 1 year of age in the state of Mississippi; to educate and involve the community in an all-out effort to improve outcomes; and to enhance collaboration and build community-academic partnerships that will enable the expansion of both training opportunities for health educators/students and community participation in health outreach projects.  


III.  	Scope of Work/Tasks to be Performed and/or Delivered  
Below outlines the associated responsibilities and tasks: 1) Coordinate a trans-departmental symposium, bringing academicians from public health, communications, and social work to discuss the projects outcomes and ways to facilitate better education and training efforts based on evidence-based research; 2) Ensure training opportunities at project events/meetings for public health faculty and students to develop and enhance the health education skills needed to undertake minority community research projects; 3)   Work with the Mississippi SIDS Alliance, Mississippi Department of Health, and other local organizations to promote the use of African American SIDS risk-reduction materials including the Resource Kit for Reducing the Risk of SIDS in African American communities; 4) Use its strong relationships and resources with the African-American communities (statewide but very critical in the Jackson region) and the Mississippi Department of Health to encourage coalition building and coordination of outreach activities with the Mississippi SIDS Alliance; 5) Provide management, communication, and planning support for training and education related activities including meetings, conference calls, and other pertinent written materials; 6) Prior experience in offering awards to grantees (or financially support the grantees) in their SIDS risk-reduction activities in the nine health districts.  Organizations requesting support must submit a brief proposal for their activities that the Contractor shall review with the PO; final approval for support will be given by the PO; 7) Assist grantees with the identification and implementation of effective ways to reach African American communities in Mississippi with the SIDS risk-reduction messages within the nine health districts; 8) In collaboration with partners and the Mississippi Department of Health establish which health districts may be a priority for the training sessions by determining where the highest SIDS rates are in the state; 9) Devise and carry out a plan for nine train-the-trainer workshops (one in each health district) with up to 35 participants each  including SIDS Coordinators, Healthy Start program staff, counselors, social workers, health care providers, outreach workers, faith-based leaders, etc. describing facilities, equipment, services and supplies needed to conduct training sessions; 10) Conduct a minimum of one train-the-trainer sessions per health district for those working in the area of reducing infant mortality as well as those working in support services (SIDS coordinators, counselors, social workers, health care providers, coroners, medical examiners, law enforcement, etc.) and ensuring that the Back to Sleep campaign messages remain consistent as a means to strengthen outreach efforts throughout the state, for a total of nine per contract year; 11) Work with the Mississippi Coroners Medical Examiners Association to establish a continuing education program for county coroners using the Back to Sleep training kits.   The Contractor shall conduct up to two to three trainings during one week out of the month every three months totaling 12; 12) Possess the necessary resources and facilities to conduct additional training based on need and request from organizations at the discretion of PO; 13) Provide post-training technical assistance and training support on SIDS risk-reduction to grantees that will be conducting outreach activities within the nine health districts; 14)  Develop and distribute evaluation forms, collect them and provide a summary of the evaluations in the training sessions report and periodically make contact with trained participants as a follow up to outreach activities held in various health districts; 15) Provide assistance to grantees to conduct between one to four community SIDS risk-reduction outreach activities in each of the nine health districts and document activities on the tracking form; 16) Plan and hold  two grant recipient meetings per contract year at the beginning and mid-year of the contract cycle as a follow-up to discuss outreach efforts, progress of project, challenges, successes, ways to improve training and education efforts, and next steps; 17) Responsible for on-site management and coordination responsibilities at each of the training locations; and 20) Devise and carry out a plan of activities for each October, SIDS Awareness Month, collaborating with partner organizations and other local interest groups.

<DESC><p>NOTICE: THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. The information provided in response to this notice will assist the Government in determining the extent of the small business and socio-economic market for the type of work described herein. The intent of the announcement is to identify sources that are qualified small business concerns capable of furnishing the National Marine Fisheries Service Center (NMFSC) with&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) advance at-sea fishery data collection capabilities through the design and development of a new catch data entry system comprising graphical user interface software and new Oracle relational database elements to be incorporated into an existing data collection and archival system; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) integrate newly developed software and database elements into the existing Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring Division (FRAMD) data collection system both through design strategy and the modification/upgrade of current companion data collection software and database components; and,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) incorporate user requirements through design, implementation, and testing meetings and provide user support for deploying, trouble-shooting, and debugging newly developed software tools.
<p>All of the FRAMD software development has been coded in C++ using Microsoft's Dot Net development package. Through ongoing maintenance, most of the current Fisheries Scientific Computer System (FSCS) data collection system has been migrated to Dot Net technology as well. The at-sea data collection system is fully coded and operational; only fundamental software maintenance and upgrades for increased data visualization, processing, and integration with database platforms are undertaken periodically.</p>
<p>The following capabilities and experience/expertise are required Contractor skills:</p>
<p>1) It is essential that the Contractor provide expert design, development, and testing skills to task requirements. To this end, Contractor experience must be sufficient to assist with system evaluation and component design, including the posing and assessment of alternatives. More specifically, the Contractor must be skilled in the design and development of software applications involving both data entry and relational database archival. Required contractor skills include software development using C++ under Microsoft's Dot Net development system; relational database design, development, and implementation; and the coding of SQL-based interactions (preferably Oracle). It is also highly desirable for the Contractor to have experience developing Oracle packaged procedures using the PL/SQL coding language and knowledge of the Oracle Apex interactive application development tool.</p>
<p>2) Currently, all elements of the data collection system have been developed under Microsoft Windows XP. Current experience with this operating system is required.</p>
<p>3) Most of the current data collection system has been developed in C++ within Microsoft's Dot Net application development system. Knowledge of this development environment is required to ensure sensible integration of new software functionality into the current data collection system, assessing potential upgrade options for this system, and for implementing modifications deriving from this assessment.</p>
<p>4) The current FRAMD data collection system relies on two Oracle database systems for the organization and management of collected data, an onboard data staging database and a central, shore-side database. The proposed catch data collection software application is required to include an Oracle database backend as well. Consequently, contractor experience with SQL-based relational database systems (preferably Oracle) is critical to the proposed software development. In addition, knowledge of Oracle's PL/SQL programming language is highly desirable, so that required functionality can be coded for optimum operation in terms of data quality and ease of use.</p>
<p>5) The most suitable software development environment will be selected during the early stages of this project. It is likely that both Microsoft and Oracle application development environments will be considered. Consequently, contractor knowledge of both the Microsoft Dot Net and Oracle's Apex application development packages is highly desirable as a basis for participating in the evaluation and implementation of the ultimate selection.<br /><br />6) FRAMD onboard data collection is automated by a variety of electronic fish measuring equipment. Experience with data collection systems that include electronic data feeds is highly desired.</p>
<p>7) User involvement in requirements specification, application testing, and system trouble-shooting is fundamental to this development project. The Contractor must be experienced in synthesizing requirements emanating from group efforts and working effectively in team trouble-shooting endeavors. Also, the Contractor will support users through brief tutorials and meetings to guide user development of operating procedures and procedure documentation.</p>
<p>Period of performance is from date of award through 14 months. The place of performance is Seattle, Washington. The North American Industry Classification Code (NAICS) is 541511 with a size standard of $25 million. All contractors doing business with the Government are now required to be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR). In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required. NOTE: THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. No solicitation document is available. No contract will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. All interested parties must respond to this announcement by June 4, 2009. Documentation to support the contractor's capability, education and experience must be in writing and include the contractor's name, address, point of contact, telephone number, DUNS Number, CCR Cage Number, business type and size, i.e., small, large, non-profit, educational, etc.; and a brief narrative regarding its capability to provide the services as described above. Any response that does not include this information will not be considered. The Government will review each response to determine if the contractor has the experience, knowledge, and capability to perform the services as specified above. Detailed information must be submitted by email to the address noted below by 1:00 PM local Seattle time (PDT), June 4, 2009. Email Address: Mona.M.Ash@noaa.gov. Questions of any nature must be addressed in writing as NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES WILL BE HONORED.</p>

<DESC>The Regional Contracting Office, Southwest (RCO SW) Region, Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton, California is conducting a Market Survey/Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability of businesses that are capable of continuing principally cellular vehicle event recorder devices (cameras) capabilities pursuant to the attached Statement Of Work (SOW).
SWFRT currently has approximately 1300 DriveCam devices in service at this time.  Of those 1300, there are 665 devices which transmit the captured video clips by cellular transmission.  The transmission method of the video clips is the key to the service charges.  The newer devices transmit via cellular service (much like a cell phone).  In addition SWRFT must maintain the current version of those devices to ensure proper data capture, transmission, and retrieval.  The older 635 devices do not transmit the captured video clips by cellular services.  The older devices have to be connected to a laptop via a cable to download the clips.  The next version downloads the clips by use of a Wi-FI service.  This is wireless, but not cellular.  SWRFT has an antenna on the side of a building and when a vehicle with that version comes within range (typically the 22 Area fuel station) the clips are downloaded to a computer in the building.  These do not require any service or software up! grades for the older versions.  As the older versions fail or require significant repair they will be phased out.  However SWRFT will not be replacing the older version devices with the newer cellular version devices on a one-for-one basis and SWRFT must target specific vehicles that they determine will provide the most benefit.   In whole, this accounts for the 1,300 figure.  The 1,000 cellular service device figure is SWRFT's basic plan for cellular type DriveCam devices as they execute their plan to migrate to 335 additional cellular devices to obtain their goal of 1,000 cellular service devices.  The future contract will only focus on this newest cellular service technology as that helps mitigate vehicle incidents. The older versions do not require service or software upgrades.  
Therefore, the SWRFT requirement is their minimum estimate to support their basic tactical plan to deploy and maintain 1,000 cellular devices, which is subject to change and is inclusive of the total 1,300 devices.  
The Government determined that by awarding a contract to a new vendor and procuring approximately 1,300 new devices would be rather expensive in-direct costs and non-monetary resources to include operational costs, purchase costs and the labor removal/installation costs.  A complete conversion replacing all 1,300 DriveCam devices with new vendor devices would definitely be cost prohibitive and operationally disruptive to the point of having a negative impact on SWRFT completing their mission. 
Another option, that was explored and will not work is leaving the DriveCam devices in service until they failed and transition to a new vendor's devices. This option would confuse technicians and administrative personnel who service, maintain, and manage the program, and would be a fiscal and operational duplication of effort.  The device and equipment version identification and inventory would become a labor intense challenge if the SWRFT ended up with two separate vendors' equipment; not to mention the requirement to maintain double work with dynamic databases, information servers, account access, download processes, and information retrieval processes. Providing the critical device incident information to SWRFT customers via the DriveCam alert system would be a challenge and may be impossible depending on other vendor's access capability.  The Government concludes that transitioning to a new vendor would not be impossible but it would be detrimental in maintaining the ef! ficiency of the SWRFT's current program and processes and is not beneficial to the Government. 
The Government does foresee a myriad of direct and in-direct operational cost savings by staying with the current vendor as there is considerable cost avoidance by not transitioning to another vendor.  
Due to operational costs and event recorder replacement costs the intent of the Government is to maintain the coverage on the existing event recorders that the Southwest Region Fleet Transportation (SWRFT) has procured and installed in their vehicles along with migrating existing non cellular event recorder devices to new cellular service event recorders as the old ones are phased out. The purpose of the anticipated contract is to procure and provide cellular event recorders in support of the Southwest Region Fleet Transportation (SWRFT), Marine Corps Installations West (MCI-West) vehicles aboard Marine Corps Base, Camp Pendleton California.  The Government anticipates that a Firm Fixed Price Indefinite Delivery-Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract to include a base year with the option to extend four additional one year periods. The requirement falls primarily under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 334310 and the business size standard is 750 employ! ees. 
Interested companies should review the attached SOW and if interested submit a detailed Capability Statement, which should include their experience and qualifications to perform this type of work together with a rough order of magnitude in price to transition the recorders and a plan that would minimize disruption. In addition, please provide any comments or questions that you may have pertaining to the SOW. Responses are due on 28 May 2009 and should include a point of contact, phone number, fax number and email address. Interested parties capable of performing this requirement should send their Capability Statement, comments and questions via email to ronnie.d.bierner@usmc.mil. No final commitment has been made to procure the stated requirement and this Sources Sought notice should not be construed as a commitment or authorization to incur costs in anticipation of such procurement. This announcement is not a Request For Proposal (RFP).  The Government is seeking informatio! n on the feasibility of competing the requirement or to confirm that this procurement should be a follow-on contract to the current contractor.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only and is intended to provide notification of the use of funds authorized under the American Reinvestment and Recovery and Act of 2009 on this contract.   The United States Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, awarded a contract to TORRES Advanced Enterprise Solutions, LLC on April 1, 2009  for project management services.   This contract action is a modification to add Recovery Act funds.  
This project will:
	Support activities to plan, manage, control and govern the execution of the MIDAS program 
	Support the acquisition process with planning, quality assurance, performance measures, cost/budget estimates, and source selection criteria 
	Support capital planning and preparation of the various Capital Planning & Investment Control (CPIC) documents needed for the yearly submission to the Office of Management and Budget 
	Support the preparation of budgets, cost estimates, risk adjusted costs development, performance work breakdown structure costs development, benefits cost development, and development of an earned value management system
	Support planning, analysis and reporting of enterprise architecture and strategic alignment with other modernization initiatives
	Provide progress reports and earned value management reporting
MIDAS is an initiative to streamline FSA business processes and develop an effective long-term IT system and architecture for FSA farm program delivery.  MIDAS will replace FSAs current farm programs information technology structure of nationally distributed systems with a centralized system that modernizes the delivery of farm programs, improves customer service and satisfaction, achieves federal compliance, and supports USDA and FSA strategic plans.  The MIDAS PMO effort will define, plan, monitor, control and document processes to ensure FSAs modernization initiative is delivered within defined scope, quality, time, and cost constraints.  To reduce risks associated with this effort, an ANSI Standard 748 certified Earned Value Management System will be used to report schedule and cost performance and track, monitor and correct any performance issues.  
This project will establish the MIDAS PMO and allow the governance process to commence.  The MIDAS effort allows FSA to begin developing a customer-centric modernization initiative that will ultimately provide USDA customers with faster, more secure, and more accurate program payments.   

The award was made non-competitively as authorized by FAR 6-302-5(b)(4) under the 8(a) Program pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637.   The nature of the work on this contract involves a number of factors that are outside the control of the contractor that could impact the contract performance.  Because of this it was determined that a fixed-price contract would not be suitable for this contract without significant mark ups in price to compensate for risks.

The award was made non-competitively as authorized by FAR 6-302-5(b)(4) under the 8(a) Program pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637. The nature of the work on this contract involves a number of factors that are outside the control of the contractor that could impact the contract performance. Because of this it was determined that a fixed-price contract would not be suitable for this contract without significant mark ups in price to compensate for risks.

<DESC>In accordance with the authority contained in FAR 6.302.1, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with ICF Consulting Services of Fairfax, Virginia to conduct a risk assessment for passenger rail equipment at a national as well as for specific operating authorities of interest. The (FRA) Office of Research and Development is investigating a revision to the existing passenger rail safety standards to incorporate multiple tiers of service which will have different levels of crashworthiness requirements stipulated.  In order to establish a clear definition of acceptable system safety for the different tiers proposed it is necessary to understand the current national level of risk for passenger rail transport for different levels of service such as intercity, high-speed intercity, regional rail networks, commuter lines, and potentially a new hybrid operation which allows commuter like service but with equipment that can also interact on inner city streets.   

The purpose of this contract is to develop a risk assessment methodology that can be applied to understand the baseline level of risk for the US passenger rail network as it is today.  

ICF has proved its unique expertise in all the necessary requirements listed below, in sub-paragraphs a through c, to successfully develop risk assessments for both the federal government and different operating authorities.

Description:  In compliance with the transparency and accountability requirements associated with the supplemental appropriations provided by the American Recovery and Re-Investment Act of 2009, Publ.L. 111-5, THIS NOTICE IS PROVIED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY, IAW FAR 5.704, Publicizing  Preaward.  The Government posts this notice of intent to issue a modification to existing Department of State Prime 3.2 Delivery Order S-AQMPD-07-F-0777 with Northrop Grumman Information Technology located at 7575 Colshire Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102-7508.  

THE PROJECT DESCRIPTION IS AS FOLLOWS:

The Tasks within Functional Task Area 8 are intended initiate key activities that will reduce the ways cyber attacks can succeed against the Department of State.  The program will produce a more secure network infrastructure that enhances the protection of IT assets for the Department of State and its partners in the U.S. foreign affairs community.  This initiative will also protect the personally identifying information of U.S. citizens receiving services from the Department of State (ex. passport requests/issuance). By implementing a state-of-the-art secure IT infrastructure, the Department of State will both enhance its ability to execute its diplomatic mission and serve the U.S. public, as well as to strengthen its infrastructure from cyber security threats; thereby better protecting information on U.S. citizens as well as national security information that is stored on our network infrastructure.  This will be accomplished through a series of technical initiatives.

Activities
1)   Security Infrastructure Design/Acquisition
a.	Design stronger digital locks, alarms, and perimeters around the Department of States information systems to better protect against cyber attacks.
b.	Engineer especially protected areas for the most sensitive data and then build these enclaves for widest possible use.
c.	Develop and implement these changes using the best techniques available to the public and private sector.

2)   Testing, Integration, Deployment
a.	Build networks flexible enough to implement changes in the management or structure of administrative services in the foreign affairs community without expensive re-design.
b.	Implement network design that will securely support the same multi-media technologies already available on the Internet for interaction between government, the citizens, business, and communities, as advocated by the administration. This includes the support of technologies including safest possible use of  social networks and streaming video/audio;
c.	Build a security foundation consistent with the many different business needs of our partner Federal agencies abroad. This involves balancing highly secure requirements with requirements to interface actively with the public on the same IT infrastructure.
d.	Test, integrate, and deploy centrally managed network with regional hubs to support all foreign affairs agencies world-wide.
e.	Build disaster recovery/continuity of operations (COOP) capabilities for the foreign affairs community.

3)    Automate critical functions using the best techniques available to the public and private 
sector for installing security patches, distributing software security upgrades, and 
monitoring dangerous events via recorded audit logs.

4)    Transition to Operations
a.	Expand network capability to make electronic exchanges with citizens interactive.   Examples of interactive exchanges could include discussion of key foreign policy issues with anyone and responses to citizen requests for services provided by the Department of State.
b.	Provide enterprise portal providing access to our partner Federal agencies into the performance and status of the enterprise network at any point in time.
Delivery Schedule
Milestones will be established by fiscal year and quarter, consistent with the best practices used by public and private organizations for technical management projects.
Environmental Review Compliance
While there will not be a direct environmental impact, this is a green initiative in two respects. First, it provides a secure IT infrastructure supporting telework and other remote execution of Department of State activities.  Second, energy efficiency will be an important consideration when evaluating the equipment used to establish this infrastructure. 
Measures

The four primary measures of project success are:
1)   Delivery of new security infrastructure for all foreign affairs agencies.
2)   User acceptance by all foreign affairs agencies.
3)   Realization of economies of scale and elimination of duplication through centralization 
      and consolidation of network service to foreign affairs agencies.
4)  Successful transition to operations for new, secure infrastructure.

Monitoring/Evaluation
The Department of State will enhance its disciplined Capital Planning and Investment Control (CPIC) process by increasing the level of scrutiny and frequency.  These processes include project life-cycle methodology with rigorous earned value management, which will show us the bang for the buck as the project proceeds.  Progress reports that include earned value data will be distributed monthly.  Project Managers are/will be certified by the Project Management Institute and trained in the Department of States standard project management methodology.

This effort will use a set of formal, established measures to ensure it achieves the desired outcome(s) and executes appropriately. 

Transparency
The Department of State will continue to use its annual performance planning process as a basis for public reporting.  The Department of State will also include all applicable information on the Recovery.gov website, which is linked to our primary website State.gov: 

The delivery order being modified was competitively awarded under U.S. AIDs Prime 3.2 Blanket Purchase Agreements. The time-and-materials modification that will be awarded is estimated to be $23 million for the period of the ARRA funding.  This modification does not increase the total celing of the delivery order.

Software maintenance includes reasonable technical support and periodic updates/releases to the software.

AITC has an existing VERITAS and BMC licensing agreement through NGIT for all VERITAS and BMC products with terms and conditions the AITC needs for its disaster recovery/continuity of business program operations.  It is in the best interest of the Government to acquire the products through this vehicle to ensure consistent terms and conditions in licensing and maintenance, and to take advantage of administrative cost savings obtained from having all products licensed and maintained through a single vendor.  The strategies are in the best interest of the Federal government and the price is fair and reasonable.  The statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  This procurement is being conducted using FAR Part 12 procedures.  Please reply no later than May 25, 2009 to Sylvia Thomas at (512) 326-6877.

<DESC><p>Introduction
<p>The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) established Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) as a federal corporation to encourage the growth of defined benefit pension plans, provide timely and uninterrupted payment of pension benefits, and keep pension insurance premiums at a minimum. Defined benefit pension plans promise to pay a specified monthly benefit at retirement, commonly based on salary and years on the job. PBGC, a wholly owned United States Government Corporation, administers the insurance program and termination process for most private-sector defined benefit pension plans that are tax-qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. PBGC is headed by a Director who reports to a Board of Directors consisting of the Secretaries of Labor, Commerce, and Treasury, with the Secretary of Labor as Chairman. General tax revenues do not fund PBGC. PBGC collects insurance premiums from employers that sponsor insured pension plans, earns money from investments and receives from the assets (if any) of the pension plans it takes over.</p>
<p>As reported in the 2008 Annual Report, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) protects the pensions of 44 million workers and retirees in over 30,000 private defined benefit pension plans. PBGC administers two pension insurance programs, the single-employer program and the multiemployer program. The single-employer program protects about 33.8 million participants in 28,000 pension plans. Under this program, a company can voluntarily seek to terminate its plan using either a standard termination or a distress termination procedure. Additionally, PBGC may seek termination of a plan without the employer's consent to protect the interest of the plan participants of the plan or of PBGC. In addition to the single-employer program, about 10.1 million people are covered by about 1,500 multiemployer plans. PBGC must seek termination when a plan cannot pay current benefits. Ultimately, as a result of the termination of pension plans, PBGC pays benefits to participants and beneficiaries. Information about PBGC's goals and objectives can be found at: http://www.pbgc.gov/</p>
<p>The Benefits Administration and Payment Department led by the Chief Operating Officer, is responsible for the administration of PBGC's trusteed plans. The work of BAPD is carried out by eight (8) Trusteeship Processing Divisions (TPDs) and six (6) Support Divisions. In addition to the federal staff, the work of BAPD is also supported by a number of contractors. Successful performance for BAPD requires contractor and federal personnel to work as a collaborative team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Overview of Field Benefit Administration Services</p>
<p>PBGC established the Field Benefit Administrator (FBA) concept in the late 1980's to handle the day-to day participant-related administration on its large plan terminations. Today, the FBAs serve a vital role in performing almost 100% of the participant administration for PBGCs trusteed plans. In order to maximize its resources, BAPD looks to the FBAs handle activities such as record gathering, database building, calculating estimated and final benefits and placing participants into pay status. The work of the FBA typically begins when a plan is recommended for termination by the PBGC. The FBA is responsible for the plan from trusteeship until a plan goes to Post Valuation Administration (formerly Ongoing Administration). In some instances, the FBA has also provided services during the PVA phase of processing. Typically the case processing cycle last on average from 2.5-3.5 years. Once the plan has gone through the Plan Closing Process, the plan is transferred to one of the two primary ongoing administration contractors.</p>
<p>CURRENT ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>The FBAs are currently responsible for the administration for approximately 600,000 participants in 400 trusteed plans. The Agency cannot accurately predict the number of terminations each year as this is a direct by product of the overall economy. The contracting vehicle sought under the proposed solicitation will allow for the required flexibility to manage the fluctuations in the inventory due to either increased or decreased plan terminations. In addition, when a plan is trusteed by the PBGC the costs and effort associated with processing that plan from trusteeship through to the plan closing process can vary significantly due to factors such as plan size, complexity, availability of data, etc.</p>
<p>FBA offices currently provides the same range of services in support of BAPD's mission, the size and structure of the FBA office varies due to different inventory levels of plans and participants the office manages. Under the current labor-hour contracts, the FBAs utilize a combination of the following labor categories to deliver services: Project Manager, Assistant Project Manager, Benefits Supervisor, Benefits Team Leader, Personnel Manager, Office Support Supervisor, Lan/Wan Administrator, Systems Technical Support, Senior Pension Administrator, Junior Pension Administrator, Entry Level Pension Administrator, Auditor, Administrative Assistant, Receptionist, and Image Scanner.</p>
<p><br />DESIRED OUTCOME</p>
<p>BAPD's desired outcome for the upcoming solicitation is provide responsive, timely and accurate services to PBGC's plan participants responsibly. BAPD must ensure that the FBAs contractor has the ability to ramp up quickly in the event of increased plan terminations and also contract when the work volume is no longer there.</p>
<p>PBGC intends to submit six (6) separate solicitations covering existing FBA offices in the following geographical areas: Wilmington, Delaware; Pueblo, Colorado; Coraopolis, Pennsylvania; Atlanta, Georgia; Sarasota, Florida and Miami, Florida. Under the FBA structure, PBGC provides all the required equipment, facilities and systems for the FBAs to operate.</p>
<p>If an offeror proposes for more than one office, the offeror must propose a different set of key personnel for each office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PBGC intends to post the soliciations covering the existing FBA offices on about the following dates:</p>
<p>Wilmington, DE and Pueblo, CO - May 15, 2009</p>
<p>Sarasota, FL and Atlanta, GA - May 20, 2009</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Brand Name Justification:
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) undertook an effort to consolidate numerous stovepipe systems and, after an analysis of various software packages, selected the COGNOS 8 Business Intelligence (BI) tool to provide information analysis and standard reporting of combined systems data.  The software provides a technical mechanism to import data from separate systems into a repository and an interface to query and report on the aggregated data.  Additionally, all ACF enterprise level solutions must be UNIX based for security reasons, which the Cognos 8 BI software meets.  This requirement is for the acquisition of software license renewal to maintain the existing Cognos 8 BI software.  This software is manufactured by IBM.  The only known distributors of the software are IBM and its authorized resellers.  No other software will meet the needs of this requirement.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).     Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman
Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman
Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. 

Closing date/time for submission of quotations is 3 JUN 2009 at 2:00 PST. Ensure that in addition to prices, quotes include applicable representations and certifications and all other information required by above incorporated clauses.  Submit responses to MLCPAC (vpl), Suite 807N, 1301 Clay Street, Oakland, CA  Attn: Jake M. Apolonio. Electronic offers submitted via FAX to (510) 637-5978 or by email to jake.m.apolonio@uscg.mil are acceptable and encouraged.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;

(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<p>The cables will be used 50% of the time in an outdoor environment which is why we spec RG-142 cable. RG-142 has a Teflon outer jacket which is more resistant to abrasion and UV. The other 40% of applications using RG-223 will be in temporary indoor environments and possibly in walls and ceilings but not on floors. The remaining applications requiring reshapable semi-rigid cable RG-402FL will be used for interconnecting components within electronic equipment.</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">14.&nbsp; When shipping back to NTIS the first year, will the turnaround times dictate that we use overnight shipping, probably with </span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">15. Based on your experience about how many shipments would you expect that we would make to you in a month? Answer: </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 36pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">The number of shipments to NTIS is contingent upon on the contractor's packaging and shipping process as well as their </span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 37.05pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">would allow us to still have the fiche for while if a customer wanted more copies or found a QC issue with a fiche copy. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 37.05pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Also, we could make several large shipments back to you rather than many small ones.&nbsp; As I read the bid now, we would just </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 37.05pt"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">package the originals in their own envelope and send them back along with the associated duplicates. Answer: <span style="COLOR: red">The contractor </span></span></p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions posed by interested Contractors as follows:

1.	Liner Material: Polyethylene or other similar chemical resistant (acid and base) materials?  Would sprayed and Teflon Coating be acceptable? 
A: Spray coating and Teflon will be our second choice if no one can provide PE or similar material.

2.	Is the vendor expected to plumb the airlock, "Air lock shall include a 3.125mm (.125") NPT pipe-tapped opening for connection of purge gas and a 6.25mm (.25") NPT outlet to venting system"?
A: Yes, vendor needs to connect the box to our venting system.

3.	I don't think we can fit our standard 10" oval in the space required, can we adjust dimensions slightly?
A: Our defined size will be considered first. If No one can meet the size request, we can choose the closest one.

4.	Doors: 0.25m x 0.25m with gasketed doors, on both sides of chamber; doors open inward; pivot upward for all the doors for space-saving.  This statement does not match the photos, please explain?
A: I changed that in our revised Solicitation. No strict required on the open direction.

5.	Transfer chamber pressure gauge with readings from 0 to -725mm (0 to -29 inches) of mercury.  Is the airlock under full vacuum at any time?
A: Just for leak test purpose, not for operation.

6.	Maintain less than 5 ppm oxygen levels and less than 50 ppm moisture levels.  Atmospheres less than 5 ppm oxygen usually require a scrubber system.  Does NIST plan on this, or should we quote a scrubber separately?  
A: If extra system required, please add the cost in the quote.

7.	Load lock door shall be at the front. Viewing window on the load lock door is required.  Is this a front hatchback window? 
A: A window similar to the drawing. Other type window should be fine as long as we can see inside.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Development of a Hypothesis BrowserPrototype which was posted on May 19, 2009.  The due date for responses is not extended. The following details are hereby added to the original synopsis:NASA/ARC has a requirement to develop a prototype of a web-based Hypothesis Browser. Thesystem will support browsing, entering, storing, editing, organizing, and searchingscientific hypotheses, along with associated arguments, evidence statements, researchliterature citations, scientist profiles, and commentary. NASA investigators have developed initial requirements for a Hypothesis Browser system,including an OWL-based ontology describing important entities, attributes, relationships,and constraints to be supported by the system. The work to be performed involvesdesigning and implementing a working prototype system that demonstrates the feasibilityand efficacy of the Hypothesis Browser concept. The Hypothesis Browser is to be developed using open source components for delivery via astandard web browser. The system is intended to be a Web 2.0 style application, with thegoal of considerable community involvement and active participation by scientificcommunity members in contributing web site content and posting comments. In theHypothesis Browser, evidence statements will be ranked heuristically and displayed tousers according to one or more schemes to be developed. Users will link hypotheses to oneanother based on the nature of their interrelationship. The offerer will design two orthree candidate web-based user interfaces to support these capabilities and will workwith NASA to select the best option for implementation. Interface usability is a keyrequirement.All responses shall provide specific and compelling evidence explaining why theorganization has the technical capability to perform this requirement and how the statedschedule and budget constraints can be met.  Examples of previous similar work may bereferenced.All other information posted initially is unchanged.Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  Thesedocuments will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWWbrowser application.

<p><strong>5/20/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received additional questions and has prepared its response provided as an attachment.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Amendment 0002</strong></span> is also attached to incorporate changes to the solicitation arising from the questions received to date. Offerors are reminded to acknowledge receipt of ALL amendments in accordance with the instructions included in the SF 30, block 11 (attached).</p>
<p>_________________&nbsp; End of Amendment 5/20/2009 notice _________</p>
<p><strong>5/18/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p>CDC received another question which is included in the attached response.</p>
<p>Also, CDC has made&nbsp;changes to the Statement of Objectives (SOO) which&nbsp;are included in the attached Amendment (i.e. SF 30).&nbsp; Offerors shall acknowledge the Amendment as per instructions contained in block 11 of the SF 30 (attached).&nbsp; The changes in the SOO are located in paragraphs 9 and 10.&nbsp; The proposal due date remains the same.</p>
<p>____________&nbsp; End of Amendment 5/18/09 notice _______________</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>5/13/09 Amendment:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Understanding that questions are not due until June 1, 2009, we have a question with regard to the page limit that we believe is critical to offerors as they work to prepare their best responses to this RFP. We wish to clarify that the page limit is indeed 75 pages, inclusive of appendices. Based on experiences bidding other CDC RFPs where this language was included in the RFP and then subsequently amended so that appendices were considered outside the 75-page limit, we wish to clarify this as early as possible in the bid process. To learn that the appendices are excluded the page limit after June 1 will make it virtually impossible for offerors to respond appropriately by the June 22 deadline.
<p>If the page limit stands as it is currently stated in the RFP, we appreciate the clarification and will respond accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>CDC response</strong>:&nbsp;reference Section 'L' on page 50 of the Solicitation, subparagraph L.9 which reads:</p>
<p>L.9 Proposal page format:</p>
<p>Pages shall be 8 &frac12; x 11, Times New Roman font, 12 pt pitch. Page fold-outs will count as 2 pages. Text printed on double-sided pages will also count as two pages. <strong>Where a page limit applies</strong>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the page limit includes</strong></span> cover letter, table of contents, index, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">appendices</span></strong>, attachments, illustrations, charts, tables, diagrams <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and all other documents</strong></span>.</p>
<p>The solicitation stipulates a <strong>75-page limit</strong> for the <strong>Technical Proposal</strong>; thus, since a page limit applies to the Technical Proposal, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>then appendices are included in the page limit</strong></span> pursuant to the instructions in subparagraph L.9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;---&nbsp;&nbsp; End of 5/13/09 Amendment ----</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
</p>
<p><strong>Solicitation Notice</strong>:</p>
<p>The solicitation # <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHS-RFP-2009-FTG7</span>&nbsp;is hereby posted as of May 08, 2009.&nbsp; The solicitation is&nbsp;attached to this amendment as MS Word file. Reference Section "L" of the solicitation for detailed&nbsp;proposal preparation and submission instructions.</p>
<p><strong>CDC received the following question from an interested offeror</strong>:</p>
<p>According to a recent news article, CDC has received a database from FEMA that is very important for conducting the Children's Health Study. We are wondering whether CDC can release information on the contents of the database (e.g., variables that will be provided to the contractor) before the RFP is released.</p>
<p><strong>CDC's response is as follows</strong>:</p>
<p>The following are the variable fields that I have in the data sets from FEMA:<br /><br />In the applicant database (NEMIS) there are:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />Name - first, last, middle initial<br />Applied date - date applied for assistance<br />email<br />Pre-disaster address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />Current address - street, city, state, zip, zipext<br />phone number - area code, number<br />alternative phone number - alt area code, alt phone number<br />Social security number<br /><br />FRRATS databases for the states:<br /><br />Registrant ID<br />name - first, last<br />Site address (trailer location address) - street, city, state, zip, county<br />lease date<br />vacate date</p>
<p>CDC makes no representation as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness&nbsp;of the information contained in the FEMA NEMIS database.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Pre-solicitation notice</strong>:<br />This pre-solicitation notice is posted pursuant to FAR 5.203(a), to advise interested offerors of the Government's intent to solicit proposals for a "full and open" competitive acquisition for a project titled: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Children's Health Study</span> (CHS). The attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) describes the Government's objectives for this acquisition. Offerors responding to the solicitation (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">when it is released</span>) will be responsible for developing and submitting their own Statement of Work (SOW) based upon the objectives contained in the attached draft SOO.</p>
<p><br />The contracting officer's "full and open" acquisition strategy decision is based upon the Government's evaluation of capability statements received in response to a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) posted to FEDBIZOPS on 2/17/2009. The Government will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> accept or consider additional capability statements at this time because the market research phase has ended.</p>
<p>In addition to the draft SOO, this notice also includes questions received in response to the Request for Information (RFI) posted on 11/21/ 2008 and the Government's responses. The attachment was previously posted with the aforementioned SSS and is provided again as a convenience to those interested offerors who may be unfamiliar with the "history" of this acquisition.</p>
<p><br /><strong>No response to this notice is requested or required.</strong></p>
<p><br />This notice is not a request for proposals. The contracting officer will request proposals when the solicitation is posted to FEDBIZOPS some time after this 15-day mandatory, preliminary notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />The Government anticipates making a single contract award for a cost plus fixed fee (CPFF) type contract. The rough order magnitude (ROM) of the contemplated contract is between $100Million to $150Million. As explained in the attached draft SOO, the resulting contract will consist of two phases: (1) A two-year Feasibility Study and (2) a six-year Full Study phase.</p>
<p><br />Any questions regarding this notice must be in writing to the contracting officer via email: ftg7@cdc.gov prior to the expiration date of this notice.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC) has a requirement  to perform an Organizational Alignment (OA) study to determine options for DESC to implement an Alternative Fuels/Renewable Energy (AF/RE) Office/focus in support of ongoing and newly emerging AF/RE mission requirements.  In addition to the OA for the AF/RE Office, phase II will be performed to review/assess the current DESC organizational structure to determine the best alignment to meet current/future requirements.  The OA is to be utilizing the following phased approach:  

Phase I will provide a recommended office structure that supports meeting alternative fuels and renewable energy requirements for DESC in the short-term.  

Phase II will address options pertaining to how DESC will align itself organizationally to support current and emerging energy related mission requirements as well as determine the best organization fit for supporting DESCs planned migration into the Systems, Applications and Products in Data Processing (SAP) Enterprise Business Solution (EBS) scheduled FY 2012.

New mission requirements will require DESC to perform an enterprise-wide organizational alignment (to include the DESC Region Offices) to determine where gaps and seams exist between current organization capability and the future requirements.  This requirement must be developed in accordance with the DLA One Book Guidance for Enterprise Organizational Alignment (EOA). These techniques will include, but not be limited to, eliminating obsolete practices; consolidating functions or activities; reengineering and restructuring organizations, functions, or activities; and adopting industry best business practices.

<DESC>This notice is for informational purposes only and is intended to provide notification of the use of funds authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 on this contract.   The United States Department of Agriculture, Farm Service Agency, awarded a contract to TORRES Advanced Enterprise Solutions, LLC on April 1, 2009  for project management services.   This contract action is a modification to add Recovery Act funds.  
This project will:
	Support activities to plan, manage, control and govern the execution of the MIDAS program 
	Support the acquisition process with planning, quality assurance, performance measures, cost/budget estimates, and source selection criteria 
	Support capital planning and preparation of the various Capital Planning & Investment Control (CPIC) documents needed for the yearly submission to the Office of Management and Budget 
	Support the preparation of budgets, cost estimates, risk adjusted costs development, performance work breakdown structure costs development, benefits cost development, and development of an earned value management system
	Support planning, analysis and reporting of enterprise architecture and strategic alignment with other modernization initiatives
	Provide progress reports and earned value management reporting
MIDAS is an initiative to streamline FSA business processes and develop an effective long-term IT system and architecture for FSA farm program delivery.  MIDAS will replace FSAs current farm programs information technology structure of nationally distributed systems with a centralized system that modernizes the delivery of farm programs, improves customer service and satisfaction, achieves federal compliance, and supports USDA and FSA strategic plans.  The MIDAS PMO effort will define, plan, monitor, control and document processes to ensure FSAs modernization initiative is delivered within defined scope, quality, time, and cost constraints.  To reduce risks associated with this effort, an ANSI Standard 748 certified Earned Value Management System will be used to report schedule and cost performance and track, monitor and correct any performance issues.  
This project will establish the MIDAS PMO and allow the governance process to commence.  The MIDAS effort allows FSA to begin developing a customer-centric modernization initiative that will ultimately provide USDA customers with faster, more secure, and more accurate program payments.   

The award was made non-competitively as authorized by FAR 6-302-5(b)(4) under the 8(a) Program pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 637.   The nature of the work on this contract involves a number of factors that are outside the control of the contractor that could impact the contract performance.  Because of this it was determined that a fixed-price contract would not be suitable for this contract without significant mark ups in price to compensate for risks.

<DESC>An attachment is added as of 20MAY09: the Sign-in sheet for the vendors in attendance at the Pre-proposal conference.

1. Within the previous amendment to this solicitation a requirement for weed-abatement was added.  This requirement is herewith deleted, as this will be handled by a previously-established contract.

2. A triple rinse of the fuel tank will be handled by a previously-established contract.  Accordingly, there will be no requirement for said rinse to be handled under this solicitation/contract.

3. The winning vendor will be authorized to utilize the "3-Mile Pit" located on Camp Pendleton for the disposal of all debris resulting from the demolition of the presently in-place concrete foundation.  The site is approximately 6-7 miles away from the work site.  This will alleviate the vendor from having to haul this debris off of the base, and should accordingly be used in the vendor's proposal.

4.  Vendor should plan on staging all equipment within the fenced perimeter.  This will include portable sanitation units and any power equipment.

5. The vendor will be required to send personnel to the base RSO (Range Safety) Class as soon as possible after notice of award.  Until said personnel are trained, all work crews will be required to have a military base escort to the site.  Once the personnel are trained, the crew will be able to approach the site without said escort.  Vendor will be issued radios by the MCAS base environmental office for the duration of the project work.  Training for radio usage will be given at the RSO Class.

6. All Past Performance Questionnaires must be submitted by COB 02 June 2009.  Accordingly, ensure your questionnaire recipients are cognizant of this date.

7.  Reminder: all questions must be submitted in writing using the question form contained within the solicitation.  The form may be submitted via electronic mail.  Cut-off date for question submission is 29 May 2009.

<a href="mailto:enrique.rivera@va.gov">Contract Officer</a>
<DESC>Statement of WorkVISN 18 Health News TV Show	CONTRACTING OFFICER'S NOTE: The pricing requested in support of this SOW is for BUDGETARY PURPOSES ONLY, as we have no formal direction to proceed with this project until the funds have been secured. This Request for Information is the first step toward that goal.Background:  Due to the retirement of the Northern Arizona VA Health Care System PAO, the VISN 18 TV show needs to go out to bid for a new contract.  The former show was a talk show format; however the VISN wants to move the show to more of a news magazine format inclusive of "broll" footage of medical experts at work on their area of expertise, interviews with subject matter experts and timely news about veterans updates.Purpose:  To help improve the image of the Southwest Health Care Network, provide health education to citizens of the southwest and notify veterans of VA services by capitalizing on the television market in three states via a local cable access and/or Public Service television program.Video/Film Production - Videotape and film production services will be provided to inform the public about current veteran health issues in various outputs such as: industry standard formats, CD-ROM, DVD and video streaming development. Filming in studios, on location or events may also be required. Examples of services include, but are not limited to: Writing, Directing, Shooting, Arranging for talent/animation, Narration, Music and sound effects, Duplication, distribution, video scoring and editing.  Length of production is expected to be 30 minutes long, with six productions occurring each year.  Product must be Section 508 compliant.Elements Required:"	Assistance in overall creation of a monthly health care oriented TV show.  Assistance includes copywriting, editing, videotaping, and compilation, accuracy checks for information, production and distribution to television markets in the state of Arizona, New Mexico and West Texas."	This will be a monthly 30-minute TV show hosted by VA staff who will serve as "talent", interviewee for health care demonstrations and serve as overall managing editor."	Segments in the production will include PSAs promoting VA and its services and needs for volunteers, etc. "	There will be three segments per each show from any three combinations of the following areas:1.	Personal Health2.	Medical Research3.	Medical Advancements4.	Physical Fitness5.	Recreation Therapy6.	Nutrition7.	Mental Health"	VA Staff will work with the Production Company in lining up stories, interviews and videotaping."	Requirements for the segments and overall show include:1.	Creating a program format template that can be used as a guide for each program. 2.	Assist with schedule of advance meetings with potential interviewees to establish expectations and research subject matter.3.	Establish a timeline for pre-production and production activities.4.	Create a guide about props and wardrobe for on camera talent and interviewees.5.	Working with VA staff on all the program segments; segment introductions, interview questions, etc.6.	Determining the exact length of the broadcast time-slot and identify any other broadcast requirements.7.	Development of script, program flow, show opens and closes, and any intros or outros needed for each segment.  8.	Provide a two camera shoot with appropriate lighting and sound, a production assistant to help with timing and program flow and a director to assist with overall efforts in creating an educational yet entertaining 30 minute TV show.9.	All editing and post production and to provide additional footage as needed.10.	Other assistance as needed."	The VISN 18 Health News will use a produced intro and outro that will then be used for all subsequent shows.  "	The Production Company will need to provide videotaping of the show segments from seven different locations in the southwest.  This can be done through subcontractors or personal travel, whichever is LEAST expensive to the government. "	The Production Company will need to provide placement and distribution of the show on cable access TV throughout the state of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.Other Considerations:  Incorporation of 508 compliance.  "	Background The Workforce Investment Act of 1998, Public Law 105-220, was enacted on August 7, 1998. Title IV of the Act is the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. Subsection 408(b) amended section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d). Subsection 508(a)(1) requires that when Federal departments or agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use Electronic and Information Technology (EIT), they must ensure that the EIT allows Federal employees with disabilities to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access to and use of information and data by other Federal employees. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal department or agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public without disabilities. "	Comparable access is not required if it would impose an undue burden."	Provision of a make up artist for all show hosts and talent."	Provision of teleprompter services for overall show flow.  In order to ensure an appropriate qualified crew is obtained for the cable access TV show, the crew must be able to demonstrate their experience beyond typical television production requirements involving three point lighting, sequential videotaping, scripting, directing, production and editing. 1.	Demonstrated knowledge and experience in working in a hospital setting around medical equipment, patients, physicians and other medical staff.  Must ensure appropriate set up of recreating a medical environment and setting as if it were to appear in real time.  2.	Experience in working with medical physicians, researchers, kiniseotherapists, registered dietitians, psychologists, psychiatrists and others in order to determine best practices in sharing that information with the general public.3.

<DESC>This task order was awarded as a cost plus fixed fee task order.  This task order could not be awarded as a fixed price task order because assumptions in the economic models must conform to those used by the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA); however, these assumptions will not be available at the time of this task order because under Section 1513 of the Recovery Act the CEA makes employment estimates 45 days following the 1512 Report (currently scheduled for October, 2009).  DOT's first two reports under Section 1201 (90 day and 180 day reports) will precede the availability of the final guidance of the CEA.  Although DOT has been in contact with the CEA, the models and assumptions will not be available prior to the first report due this fall.  The DOT estimates must be consistent with the CEA since CEA represents the President's economic council.  This may require the contractor to restate prior estimates and alter the estimation methodology.  As a result of many factors which are unknown at this time, including the final guidance from the CEA, the task order cannot be awarded as a fixed price task order.


On February 17, 2009, President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) promising not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. That focus on jobs is codified in the law under Section 1201(c)(2) (underlining added).

(2) CONTENTS OF REPORTS.  For amounts received under each covered program by a grant recipient under this Act, the grant recipient shall include in the periodic reports information tracking-

(F) the number of direct, on-project jobs created or sustained by the Federal funds provided for projects under the appropriation and, to the extent possible, the estimated indirect jobs created or sustained in the associated supplying industries, including the number of job-years created and the total increase in employment since the date of enactment of this Act; and

(3) TIMING OF REPORTS.  Each grant recipient shall submit the first of the 

periodic reports required under this subsection not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act and shall submit updated reports not later than 180 days, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after such date of enactment.

There is a need to develop a unified approach to the estimation of indirect and induced employment associated with ARRA projects. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is interpreting the language of Section 1201 as requiring, for purposes of estimating the total increase in employment since the date of enactment of this Act, to include an estimate of the number of induced jobs created. Currently, estimates of induced jobs for different types of projects are subject to differing assumptions imbedded in the economic models used for these estimates. In addition, for all aspects of this Task Order a job shall be defined as equivalent to 2,080 hours commonly referred to as a job-year. 

In addition, the induced employment estimate needs to use the assumptions used by the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA) in their ARRA employment reports (where induced jobs are referred to as indirect jobs). The CEA is expected to use assumptions comparable to those used by Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein in their January 9, 2009, analysis, available at http://otrans.3cdn.net/ee40602f9a7d8172b8_ozm6bt5oi.pdf. 

Although this Task Order is issued through Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) the project is to estimate the indirect and induced employment for all the DOT modes.

<DESC><p>The Separation Process Research Unit (SPRU), located at Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory (KAPL) in Niskayuna, New York, was operated from 1950 to 1953 as a pilot plant to research the REDOX and PUREX chemical processes to extract uranium and plutonium from irradiated uranium. These operations contaminated the SPRU facilities and environmental media, resulting in the need to remediate the SPRU site. The SPRU site land areas are owned by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and are currently maintained by SPRU Project contractors. See Exhibit A-SPRU Project Area Locator Photographs, and Exhibit D- SPRU Project Applicable Documents. The SPRU site land areas addressed in this scope of work cover approximately 15 acres.

<STAUTH>FAR 6.302-2
<AWDNBR>SP4510-09-P-0002
<ARCHDATE>06222009
<DESC>2.  Description of Action.  It is anticipated that an Unusual and Compelling Urgency Firm Fixed Price contract will be awarded to BB &E, LLC.  This will allow BB & E, LLC to continue service while a follow-on solicitation is developed.

3.  Description of Supplies or Services.  DLA Enterprise Support (DES) requires engineering support for managing programs/efforts to sustain, repair and/or modernize DRMS facilities and equipment worldwide.  The award is a six (6) month bridge con tract with a three (3) month option period.    Solicitation number is SP4510-09-Q-3019.

4.  Authority Cited.  10 U.S.C.2304(c)(2) as implemented by FAR 6.302-2 -- Unusual and Compelling Urgency.

5.  Reason for Authority Cited.  The current contract expires on 30 April 2009.  The current procuring activity providing support for this DES requirement is USPFO for Michigan, Lansing, MI.  DES has confirmed that this support will not be available after 30 April 2009.  As a result DES must hastily pursue an immediate short-term option.  Without some contract to bridge between the current contract termination and a new contract, DES anticipates severe problems in their support of DRMS mission and compliance.  This may cause projects, spending, workload, etc. to slip in to the next FY before a conventional contract can be awarded.  Weekly updates to DRMS tracking of functions (via numerous IPRs, R&A, teleconferences, etc.) will be crippled without outside/contractor support, truly hampering and frustrating DRMS.

BB&E is the preferred vendor, as any other choice would compromise efficiencies developed over the past three (3) years.  Costs to gain support from another vendor, pending a fully competed, long term contract would be more attributed to ramping up to fully effective performance than actual productivity on the bridge contract.

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition.  No efforts will be made to solicit additional sources as only BB&E can perform this work in a timely manner and without duplicating costs.

7.  Actions to Increase Competition.  No efforts will be made to increase competition on the bridge contract.  However, the follow-on requirement will be competed in accordance with the FAR.

8.  Market Survey.  It is anticipated the follow-on solicitation will be competed under NAICS code 541330 - Engineering Services.  It is anticipated there will be several potential offerors that may respond to the follow-on solicitation.

9.  Interested Sources.  For the bridge contract no other sources will be solicited.  A synopsis of this requirement is not required in accordance with 5.202(a)(2) as award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures.

10.  Other Factors.

a.  Procurement History.
