<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  NBQ030075 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-15.  The age of existing Z/I Imaging equipment necessitate its conversion from parallel to serial connections for compatibility with Windows XP operating system. This upgrade requires internal rewiring of the system and provisioning of compatible components necessary to accomplish the upgrade.  The effort shall be performed by a Z/I Imaging certified technician who is completely familiar with the  Z/I Imaging P3 analytical StereoPlotter, its operation and maintenance requirements.  To avoid lengthy loss of system availability, this effort must be completed in two working days.  As this effort is to be performed on the Denver Federal Center, Security Requirement for Performance of Work on the Denver Federal Center applies.  In order for Contractor personnel to access facilities located on the Denver Federal Center, the required clearance procedures must be completed prior to the employee reporting to the Denver Federal Center to commence performance of the contracted effort.  It is the responsibility of the Contractor to obtain the appropriate security clearance for personnel who will require access to locations within the Denver Federal Center.  The costs associated with obtaining the required clearances (completion and submission of the required clearance forms) are the responsibility of the Contractor and will NOT be reimbursed by the Government.  Contractor personnel that have not completed the required security clearance procedures and have not received the appropriate clearance will not be allowed access to the Denver Federal Center.  As such, Contractors are encouraged to utilize the attached forms to obtain the needed clearance.  Typically, two (2) to five (5) working days after receipt are required to complete the processing of the request.  Failure of the Contractor to obtain the appropriate clearances in a timely manner does not constitute an excusable delay with respect to contract performance. The following apply and are incorporated by reference: 52.212-1 -- Instructions to Offerors -- Commercial Items (Jul 2003), FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions Commercial Items (Feb 2002) and 52.212-5 -- Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders -- Commercial Items (June 2003).  Offers are due by 4:00 PM 24 September 2003 and shall be submitted by Email to Roberta_Truax@BLM.GOV.
