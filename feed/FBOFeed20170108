<DESC>This Sources Sought Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational purposes to locate capable businesses. The Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) is conducting market research and desires input from the industry to assist in requirements planning. The information requested by this RFI will be used within the DoDEA to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of DoDEA.

<p>1. Description: DoDEA is seeking sources to replace its aging and failing Interactive Flat Panels (IFP's) that are located in DoDEA classrooms and offices worldwide. There are also plans to outfit new DoDEA schools with IFPs as the schools are opened. The potential contract to purchase IFB's will include installation of new IFPs, removal and disposal of old IFPs, and user training (web-based or in person) for the newly installed IPFs. The potential contract will require multi-touch interactive display packages with the availability of select sizes and specifications as well as peripherals for use in classroom spaces, meeting spaces, and other collaborative areas in schools and offices worldwide. It is expected the newly purchased IFPs will be required to operate using SMART Notebook 16 software.</p>

<p>a. Below are the major features the IFPs are expected to have. Please respond to the information and questions requested below:</p>
<p>i. DoDEA would like the option to purchase Interactive Flat Panels (IFPs) in at least three incremental sizes between 42 and 100 inches. Please provide the sizes available for you IFP's.</p>
