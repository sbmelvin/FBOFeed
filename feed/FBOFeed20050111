<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plans to procure on a sole source basis an EndoScout Tracking System for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with Robin Medical, Inc., P.O. Box 2414, Baltimore, Maryland 21203.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The ROB, NCI, has a clinic for the treatment of patients with cancer using linear accelerators, CT (Computed Tomography) scans and MRI.  The treatments include localized and total body exposure to radiation.  The EndoScout is the only FDA approved tracking system, known by the NCI that can be used on closed bore MRI, similar to the systems currently being used at the Clinical Center.  The other tracking systems that are available are either optical (which can only be used with open scanners), or electromagnetic that cannot be used inside the bore of the scanner.  The EndoScout technology has FDA clearance for use under MRI for guidance of surgical interventions.  The EndoScout provides in real-time the position of the device during MR scanning.  This enables the users to guide an interventional procedure to target inside the body.   Robin Medical Inc. is the only source known to the NCI.  Robin Medical is the owner of this technology, and is the sole manufacturer and distributor of this system.  The EndoScout technology is protected by US Patent 6,516,213.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.

<DESC>The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has a requirement for a facility to provide spaces for the annual Special Agent Promotion Program (SAPP) training and assessment center meeting in accordance with the attached Statement of Work below.  The reference number for Request for Proposal is DEA-05-HR-0009.  DEA intends to issue a purchase order under the test program described in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 13.5.  The following FAR Part 12.3 provisions and clauses are applicable to this acquisition.  52.212-1(Jan.2004) Instruction to Offerors-Commercial Item, 52.212-3 (May 2004) Offeror Representations and Certifications – Commercial Item, 52.212-4 (Oct 2003) Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items.  52.212-5 (Dec 2004) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.  The full text of provisions and clauses may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):http://www.access.gpo.gov, and http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 721110.  The Small Business Size is $6.0 million.

The proposal representing the best value will be determined by the following criteria, in descending order of importance: (1) size of meeting spaces; (2) location of meeting spaces within the hotel; (3) quietness of the meeting space/testing areas; (4) number and type of food selections; (5) amenities; and (6) price.  Potential offerors shall provide separate proposals for each training/assessment center meeting.  The Government preference is that one facility hosts both meetings, however, all offers will be considered.  The numbers of assessors and candidates for both meetings may decrease by as much as fifteen percent.  In addition the ending dates may be adjusted once the final count of participants is received.  With regard to guest rooms, the dates listed below represent check in and check out dates, i.e., April 27-29, 2005, refers to a two-night stay with a check in of April 27 and check out of April 29.

The following is a brief description of the testing process.  The first two days of the test dates, agents who will serve as raters (assessors) for the testing will be trained in a large conference room.  Beginning on the third day, agents who wish to be assessed (candidates) will arrive for one day of testing.  Each weekday a new group of agents will arrive to be assessed.  The candidates will be evenly split into two groups.  One group will participate in group testing in the conference room before lunch and individual exercises held in the guest rooms after lunch.  The second group will have the opposite schedule, with individual exercises before lunch and group testing after lunch.

2. April 25-26, 2005, one conference room which can accommodate a training class of 50 individuals with the tables in a classroom arrangement, two people per table.

<DESC>UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
Notice of Intent to Lease Space
Using Other Than Full and Open Competition
Plantation, Florida

The United States Government intends to award a succeeding lease, using other than full and open competition to Atrium Plaza LLC, of Plantation, Florida.  The lease will be for 25,626 rentable square feet of fully serviced space for a term of five-years with partial cancellation privileges after one-year.

The Government has a continuing need for this space.  It has been determined that a succeeding lease will result in less cost to the Federal Government when the economics of moving, telecommunications, security, and duplication of tenant improvements are taken into consideration as an economic factor.

Firms who are interested in commenting regarding the Government’s intention to award this project under Other Than Full and Open Competition or in obtaining additional information regarding the above procurement should provide their written comments to Louise Long, Contracting Officer, at louisem.long@gsa.gov  or to her attention at GSA, Realty Services Division, Atrium West Building, 7771 West Oakland Park Boulevard, Suite 119, Sunrise, Florida.  Any written comments are to be received by the Contracting Officer January 21, 2005.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the Department of Defense Medical School and Health Sciences University, hereby announces its intent to award a sole source Purchase Order to FIBERGATE of Alexandria, VA, for the Lease and Maintenance of two pair fiber cables to provide connection from USUHS Building 71A to our remote sites in Forest Glenn and Silver Spring.  The Lease will be for the period of performance of one year with option to extend four (4) more years.  The Statutory authority permitting this award under other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304 (C) (1), as cited in FAR 6.302-1(a) that authorizes USUHS to award contracts when only one responsible source and no other supplies or service will satisfy agency requirements.  

This is a folow-on contract for the continued Lease and Maintenance of fiber cables originally installed and Leased by Fibergate.  Award to other source will result in substantial duplication of cost and not in the best interest of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<CONTACT>James Van Oss,937-904-4192
<DESC>Update (1-11-05) CONTRACT TYPE CHANGED TO IDIQ ON-LINE CERTIFICATIONS AND REPRESENTATIONS APPLICATION (ORCA) REQUIREMENT ADDED CLARIFICATION REGARDING PAST PERFORMANCE The Government has amended the RFP to change the contract type from a "C" type  contract to an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract.   As these changes are essentially a restructuring of the pricing tables from  within the H clauses to Pricing Exhibits and a change in ordering procedures,  no RFP schedule changes are being made.  These changes are hereby posted as the  second amendment to the RFP.  In addition, the Government has enacted a few  other changes in order to comply with the new ORCA requirement that became  effective on 1 Jan 2005.   As a result, the following documents have been changed: 1)  The model contract 2)  Section K, Certifications and Representations 2)  Section L   The changes in the clauses in the model contract are listed in these two  documents, ESUP_Previous_Section_H_vs_Pricing_Exhibits.doc and  ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc.  Several exhibits, e.g. PA-PQ, have  been created to replace the majority of the H clauses, and are included in  the .pdf version of the model contract.  In addition, MS Excel versions have  the documents have been posted on PIXS in .zip file,  ESUP_IDIQ_Pricing_Exhibits.zip.  If you are unable to access the Excel files,  please contact one of the contractual POC+s listed below for assistance.     Offerors are asked to utilize the new tabular format for the pricing.  The  tables may need to be adjusted, changed to landscape mode, etc. to accommodate  your dollar values.  This is a perfectly acceptable approach.   The DD Form  1423+s, Exhibit A, include the changes from Amendment 1. Exhibit B is the list  of support equipment that originally appeared in SCR H-118.  The Statement of  Objectives, Attachment 1, has not been changed, but is serving as a placeholder  for the contractor proposed Statement of Work. A paragraph with information regarding ORCA has also been posted as  ORCA_Information.doc.  The clause added to Section K can be found within that  section and is referenced in the ESUP_Model_Contract_Clauses_Changed.doc  document. Section L has been posted in its entirety with all the Amendment 1 and  Amendment 2 changes incorporated.  Amendment 1 changes are in red; Amendment 2  changes are in blue.   Due to an ambiguity in the RFP regarding the Past Performance Questionnaires,  the Government would like to highlight a couple key passages from the original  RFP, and two key changes to the RFP document.   In paragraph 4.1.1 (b) (6),  Section L of the RFP states "All Past Performance Questionnaire Tracking  Records shall be submitted with the offeror+s proposal as an addendum to Volume  II.  This exchange/contact between the offeror and its POCs shall cease upon  submission of the offeror’s proposal to the Government in response to this  RFP."  In Attachment 4 to Section L, it states, "We are seeking at least two  POC’s, per relevant contract, to submit a completed Present/Past Performance  Questionnaire directly to the Government no later than [OFFEROR FILL-IN RFP  CLOSING DATE (30th calendar day after RFP release)]."  Because these statements  do not provide a clear and unequivocal cutoff date for receipt of the Past  Performance questionnaires, the Government has amended these passages to remove  the ambiguities/discrepancies.  The due date for Past Performance  questionnaires is the RFP closing date of 31 Jan 2005 at 12:00 pm EST.  In  addition, the phone and fax numbers associated with submittal of these  documents has been changed to reflect the current location of the Government  POC.  Offerors may need to contact their potential  respondents to ensure that  the respondents have the correct phone and fax numbers.  Also, as was  previously mentioned, a list identifying respondents to Past Performance  Questionnaires will be provided to each respective offeror in the near future  to aid in your tracking of these responses.         If you have any questions or concerns regarding this amendment or any aspect of  the ESUP program, please contact one or both of the contractual POC+s listed  below.  Please remember to begin any email subject line with "ESUP".

This will enable the Government to provide  timely feedback regarding any questions about receipt of these questionnaires  and will help us to provide a tally of the received questionnaires.

In addition, answers to various questions and clarifications  have also been posted to clarify the changes found in the amendment and to  respond to questions or clarifications that did not result in a change to the  RFP.   An amendment changing the contract type from a "C" type contract to an "IDIQ"  type contract is still planned to be released in the near future.  Due to the  potential for inclement weather and various other factors, this amendment may  be released following the December 25th holiday rather than before.  For the  convenience of the offerors, this amendment will be a re-release of all  documents and will include all changes set forth in the first amendment as well  as those changes planned for the second amendment.

As  part of the internal review process for RFP+s, it has become evident that it is  in the best interest of both the Government and the offerors to change the  pricing structure of the contract to 5 years FFP and 5 years FP/EPA.  The  current constraints on NTE options would negatively impact both the flexibility  of the contract and the level of confidence in the out years.   If you have any questions or comments, please contact the contractual POC  listed below. Contractual POC: Jim Van Oss, Contract Negotiator, james.vanoss@wpafb.af.mil,  937-904-4192, ASC/YTA, Bldg 11A, Room 201-I, 1970 Monahan Way, WPAFB, OH 45433- 7211. //End of Update// UPDATE (10-14-2004) AC vs. DC Seat Actuator on T-38 ESUP The purpose of this announcement is to provide information regarding a question  about seat actuators from the recent Industry Day.  Because this information  could have a significant impact on potential solutions, it is being released  prior to the posting of the other questions and answers.   Changing from Alternating Current to Direct Current Seat Actuators for the T- 38C ESUP  This question was forwarded to OO-ALC/LCEA for their review and comment.  They  recommend we do not use DC actuators if at all possible.  The DC load is taxed  with the AUP upgrade and other changes are pending to add further loads to the  DC buss.  The change to DC would also require an aircraft rewire to add a  circuit breaker and cabling.  It would be less of an impact to use AC actuators  and a much simpler modification to the aircraft.  The present AC system has 5  amp circuit breakers.  If at one half the capacity of the 5 amp breaker (2.5  amps,) 2.5 X 115 volts=287.5 VA.  With DC of 28 volts equals 10 amps current  draw.  Conservatively, this is approximately one fifth the battery capacity.   Operation of both seats at the same time would further impact the battery  drain.

Services shall be provided for a base period with 4 consecutive 12 months Government unilateral options to extend.  In order to ensure rapid emergency response, the consultant shall maintain a facility with key personnel supporting this contract within a 50 miles radius of the Pentagon Reservation. The proposed dollar  Threshold amount is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.The   minimum dollar amount per year shall not be less than $5,000.00.  
The Selection shall be based on the following criteria.
 
The Technical Evaluation Committee will evaluate three areas – Past Performance,  Qualifications & Experience of Key Personnel, and price for Providing Fire Protection Services. Consultant’s SF330 shall clearly identify capacity, capability, experience, past performance, and project team and organization’s specialized experience and knowledge of local codes and standards. Offerors will be ranked based on past performance and technical expertise in fire protection engineering. The three highest ranked offerors will be required to provide an oral presentation limited to one (1) hour, at the offeror’s office  addressing past performance, technical expertise and introducing key personnel. After completions of oral presentations, the three highest ranked offerors will be re-rated and ranked based on past performance and technical expertise as demonstrated in their SF 330 and their oral presentation. The Government will then enter into negotiations with the highest ranked offeror to achieve a fair and reasonable rate schedule.  

Factor 1:  Past Performance  

Description:  This factor considers the extent of the offeror’s past projects and experience, within the last five (5) years for fire protection engineering responsibilities as outlined in the scope of work (SOW).  

Standard For Evaluation:  The offeror has performed projects in the Fire Protection field and to that described in the solicitation under at least three (3) contracts.  

Factor 2:  Qualifications & Experience of Key Personnel

Description:  This factor examines the qualifications, knowledge, skills and experience of the offeror’s key personnel.  It considers specific details of key personnel concerning experience, training, and knowledge of Fire Protection Services and related fields. Training and education should be commensurate with the position held, emphasizing a person’s knowledge of Fire Protection and related fields, along with managerial and supervisory skills.

Standard For Evaluation:  (1) Key staff personnel and subcontractor's resumes demonstrate adequate training, experience and education to perform tasks required of this contract. (2) The resumes provided by the offeror, in conjunction with the organizational charts provided for Factor 2, demonstrate adequate delegation of responsibility an authority to key staff personnel and subcontractors for responsive and effective contract administration.

The consultant shall submit hourly rates including overhead and profit for technical specialties per the GSA schedule. The offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated in order to determine if it is realistic, complete, and reasonable.   Realism is evaluated by assessing the compatibility of proposed costs with proposal scope and effort.  Completeness is evaluated by assessing the level of detail the offeror provided in cost information for all RFP requirements in the statement of work and technical documents, and assessing the traceability of estimates.  Reasonableness is evaluated by comparing the proposed prices received in response to the RFP, or comparing prices with other similar effort.
	
Unrealistically low proposed costs or price estimates may be grounds for eliminating a proposal from competition either on the basis that the offeror does not understand the requirement or the offeror has made an unrealistic proposal.
	
The offeror’s proposed cost/price shall not be controlling for source selection purposes.  Proposals shall be evaluated instead for award purposes at the most probable cost to the Government for the basic requirements and all options.  The most probable cost to the Government shall be computed based upon the Government Cost Estimate.

BASIS FOR AWARD

Unless all offers are rejected, award will be made to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best overall value, price and other factors considered.  In determining the best overall response, technical superiority (including past performance and experience on similar projects, qualifications and experience of key personnel) will be the most important consideration, however, cost/price will be a factor.  The Government may select for award the offeror whose price is not necessarily the lowest, but whose technical proposal is more advantageous to the Government and warrants the additional cost.

This is a best value source selection in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3. Award will be made to the offeror who is deemed responsible, whose proposal conforms to the RFP requirements, and is judged to represent the best value to the Government.  

Award will be based on a best value for the Government considering past performance, technical expertise, and negotiated cost with past performance and technical expertise being more important than cost.

ALL PROPOSAL ARE DUE ON JANUARY 28, 2005 @ 1:00 P.M. ALL QUESTION SHALL BE RECEIVED NO LATER THAN JANUARY 14, 2005 @ 2:00 P.M. BY EMAIL TO dorothea.garner@whs.mil or faxed to (703) 692-4091/92.

<DESC>Cancer Information Service----
Concept for 2004------
The draft concept for the next cycle of the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Information Service contracts published in FedBizOpps on May 21, 2003 elicited numerous comments and questions.  This updated concept document incorporates additional information on the concept and serves as a general response to the most frequently cited concerns and questions.   THIS DOCUMENT IS PUBLISHED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  COMMENTS ARE NOT BEING CONSIDERED AT THIS TIME.  No response to this announcement is necessary.  ---------
-----------Background-----------
The Cancer Information Service (CIS) is the National Cancer Institutes  (NCIs) communications network for the public.  The program is operated through contracts competitively awarded every five years.  New contracts will be awarded to commence operations on October 15, 2004.  As the NCI Cancer Information Service Office prepares for re-competition of its Cancer Information Service regional contracts, two divergent but equally important priorities are apparent.  A new concept for the program must retain current, valuable regional partnerships developed with key stakeholders over the 2 previous contracting cycles (13 years).  Changes to the current network configuration could destroy the credibility the program has worked hard to establish and ultimately damage NCIs influence with regional partners and in State Cancer Control Planning activities. At the same time, the need to maintain the CIS regional presence must be balanced with the imperative to hold the line on program costs and utilize technological advances that enable an efficient and economical operation of the CIS Information Service ---------
CIS 2004--------------------
The following is a concept for the next 5-year CIS contract period (2004-2009).  The concept is based on two factors: cancer health disparities and advances in technology.  The CIS Partnership Program is currently addressing the critical issue of cancer health disparities successfully.  The Partnership Program collaborates with partner organizations to reach minority and medically underserved populations and populations with limited access to health and cancer information.  Consolidation of CIS telecommunication operations will reduce duplication of effort and maximize program resources.  Use of new systems technology will enhance efficiency and quality of program operations. ----------
In the proposed CIS concept, a regionalized CIS Partnership Program is the foundation of the program. The current network configuration will be maintained to operate the Partnership Program, with the addition of Hawaii as a separate region. The Information Service, currently operated as a program component in 14 regional offices, will continue to provide multiple access points for the public.  However, it will be consolidated into four Coordinating Centers geographically situated to provide support and coordination of critical functions for a cluster of surrounding regional Partnership Program contracts.  ------

The four Coordinating Centers are configured to achieve approximate equivalency in population numbers in the eastern, central, and western portions of the country, while also accounting for differences in time zones and the partnership configuration. Experience in the current contracts shows that when calls are routed to the next available agent in a cluster of regions that the telephone service operates efficiently and transparently to users. The reduction in the number of CIS contact centers does not decrease capacity. The same number of users will be served.  The reduction in the number of contact centers allows significant cost savings while permitting the Coordinating Centers to function as anchors for the Partnership Program.-----

The plan is to award 15 contracts to operate the Partnership Program.  All potential contractors shall propose to operate the Partnership Program in one of the designated regions. All offerors will be encouraged to pursue Partnership Program subcontracts or other agreements to provide an equitable regional presence of the program as in the current contracts.

------------------CONCLUSION-------------------------
The proposed concept for the CIS does not reduce the capacity of the CIS to meet the cancer information needs of the public.  It realigns program resources, reduces costs, and promotes competition while retaining the strengths of its current CIS regional Partnership Program. The new concept maximizes NCIs potential for preserving trusted, long-standing regional relationships. At the same time, CIS is using technology to consolidate operations without severing the Partnership Program from the vital resources of the Information Service.  In the new concept, regionalized Partnership Program contracts maintain and enhance CISs ability to promote and deliver NCI products such as Cancer Control PLANET and the Clinical Trials Education Series through established partners.  In addition, the concept facilitates a practical communications link between regional Partnership Program contracts through the creation of Coordinating Centers that use technology to consolidate operations and provide a centralized location for streamlining critical program functions such as training and technical support for all program areas.

<DESC>PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE (09 DEC 04) – Archived solicitation/synopsis  information See below attached file for archived PIXS soliciation synopsis information  (initial through Amendment 20).

<DESC>“This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil. While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the NSWC Division Crane." MARKET SURVEY – SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane is seeking solutions to flash and sound suppression needs for its Lightweight Machine Guns, MK46 5.56mm and MK48 7.62mm.  The required effort is to explore industry capability to supply a coordinated modular family of complementary flash/sound suppressors.  LMGSS System configurations are desired to support the MK46, the MK48 and/or combination of both weapons.  This development program is interested in exploring extended life, expanded application, high-endurance lightweight machine gun flash and sound suppression solutions that demonstrate noteworthy capabilities.  Ultimately, the LMGSS will correct the current operational shortfall of sound suppressors that are optimized for use with current MK46 and MK48 lightweight machine guns.  Sought are improvements in suppressor designs to lessen effects on host weapon rate of fire and eliminate or reduce heat retention, visual and auditory cues, materials! , manufacturing processes, high endurance coatings, and new technologies that yield extended performance sound suppressor life to 15,000 - 25,000 rounds under various firing schedules.  LMGSS will be required to fit the MK46 in the 5.56 variant, and the MK48 in the 7.62 variant.  Paper writers shall address Fit, Function, Flash Suppression, Sound Suppression/Distortion, SOF Environment (Surf, Rough Handling), Accuracy, and Interoperability in relating their organization's experience, understanding and plan for resolving the issues.  At this time, the Government is not seeking a lengthy research and development program, instead, a more immediate solution--perhaps from enhanced technologies which already exist or from application of emerging technology to existing hardware is sought.   Delivery of prototypes will be required 120 days after award of purchase orders.  Parties interested in having their solutions/ideas considered for funding are referred to Broad Agency Announcem! ent (BAA) N00164-05-R-0001 for submission of "white papers".  Although the BAA generally provides an open ended schedule for submission of white papers, this request for papers encourages interested parties to submit their white papers no later than 4:00 PM EST, 28 February 2005 in order to guarantee consideration for award using available but limited funding.  Paper writers are instructed to follow BAA instructions for form and content of papers with special attention given to any stated restrictions, e.g., page limitations, and including the information requested above.  BAA evaluation criteria and process will be used by the Government to select the winning white papers for which orders may be awarded.  It is the Government's intent to award multiple small (less than $100K) orders for promising development proposals, using simplified acquisition procedures.  These orders are expected to include requirements for delivery to the Government of a maximum of fifteen (15) proto! types of each configuration to be used for Government testing.

<DESC>This announcement is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  Its purpose is to generate responses from qualified 8(a), HUBZONE, veteran owned, disabled veteran owned, or small business companies, which have the interest and ability to provide FDA access to data resources that can be used to conduct drug safety analyses to the benefit of the public’s health, to respond expeditiously to urgent public safety concerns, to provide a mechanism for collaborative pharmacoepidemiological research designed to test hypotheses, particularly those arising from suspected adverse reactions reported to FDA, and to enable rapid access to U.S. population-based data sources to ensure public health safety when necessary.  Companies responding to this synopsis must indicate whether they are interested in this project as a prime contractor or as a possible subcontractor.  Companies interested in this requirement as a subcontractor must indicate their areas of expertise that would support a prime contractor in the performance of the work described below.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 541990.  Contractors must submit a capability statement describing their company’s experience and ability to conduct as the prime contractor or support as a subcontractor epidemiologic studies of adverse effects of marketed drugs.  FDA is not interested in developing a database as a part of any resultant contract and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as the means to access the data.  A one (1) year base contract with four (4), one (1) year options is intended.  

The evaluation process of Offerors submitting capability statements as a prime contractor will consist of an assessment of the minimum mandatory data resource requirements.  If a database does not meet the minimum mandatory requirements outlined below, the Offeror shall be deemed nonresponsive.  The Minimum Mandatory Data Resource Requirements are that the Offeror provide documentation that its data resource contains a minimum of 2 million currently enrolled patients or covered lives within the US as of July 1, 2004 and that the Offeror provide documentation of its ability to retrieve inpatient medical records.

The FDA will use the minimum requirements and the written capability statement to determine whether Offerors are able to meet the following data resource requirements: ability to provide US health encounter data for pharmacoepidemiology studies through collaboration with FDA; availability of a computerized system for linking each patient to all relevant medical care data including enrollment status, drug exposure data, coded medical outcomes, vital records (desired, but not required), cancer registries (desired, but not required), and birth defect registries (desired, but not required); capability of providing a patient population with low turnover, thereby permitting long-term longitudinal follow-up of most patients for acute or delayed adverse effects from drugs or other medical products; ability to capture all outpatient prescription drug exposures and health provider encounters, linked longitudinally to each patient; ability to capture all health provider encounters whether in the ambulatory, emergency, chronic care, or acute care setting in sufficient detail so that FDA has the ability to estimate the contribution of various risk factors (e.g., age, gender, dose, co-existing disease, disease severity, concomitant medications) associated with the occurrence of medical events of interest; demonstrated (post HIPAA) ability to access and retrieve complete, primary medical records as required for completion and validation of studies; ability to provide exposure data on new molecular entities (those approved within the last 5 years in the United States) and identify adverse drug events that occur infrequently (i.e., at rates lower than can be detected in clinical trials); ability to provide data and preliminary analyses to determine the feasibility of formal studies within 4 weeks of a data request; capability to form groups (i.e., cohorts) of patients exposed to one or more drug or biologic products and to follow them for the occurrence of one or more medical outcomes; full disclosure of data collection, coding, and configuration methods to allow FDA to appropriately interpret findings; and it shall be solely the Offeror’s responsibility to de-identify the data for FDA use.  FDA will require no patient-, provider-, or health plan-specific identifiers.

In providing access to longitudinal, population-based data, the Offeror shall ensure that the following criteria are met.  At a minimum, the database description shall include: number of people (active and inactive) in the database, distribution of person time by calendar year in the database, extent of geographic diversity, demographics, size of special populations of interest (including children, women of childbearing age, and elderly patients); turnover rate, and enrollment data (if applicable) for participating individuals.

In addition, the following information shall be provided to FDA: the number of years of data available overall; the lag time between the health encounter date and availability of the data; the mean, median, and range of observation time for patients in the database; and data collection and management procedures.

These longitudinal data shall have the capability to follow uniquely identifiable individuals (using encrypted patient identifiers).  Demographic information including but not limited to age and gender, health history, diagnoses and procedures, and hospitalizations shall be provided.  Information on race/ethnicity shall be included if available, accompanied by documentation of the origin of this information.  In addition, for each patient these data shall contain prescription drug and biologic utilization information, including the generic and brand name of the product, strength, dosage form, days supply, all dates dispensed, initial/continuing therapy indicator, quantity dispensed, instructions for use (if available), and prescriber specialty.

The evaluation process of Offerors submitting capability statements as a subcontractor will consist of a subjective assessment of the Offeror’s expertise and experience in supporting the work described above.

Interested Offerors shall provide (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed or being performed; (2) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; resumes for proposed key personnel should be included; (3) any other specific and pertinent information as pertains to this Sources Sought Notice that would enhance FDA’s consideration and evaluation of the information submitted.  Responses must reference Request for Information (RFI) number 223-05-3001 and include the following:  (1) name and address of firm, (2) type of business (i.e.: small business, small disadvantaged 8(a) certified, HUBZONE, woman-owned small business, small disadvantaged business (not 8(a) certified), veteran-owned small business, disabled veteran owned business, etc.) (3) two points of contact:  name, title, phone, fax and e-mail, (4) DUNS number, (5) NAICS codes, (6) contractor’s capabilities statement which provides the information stated above, (7) list of customers covering the past 5 years including a summary of similar work performed, contract number, contract type, dollar value for each customer, reference and customer point of contact with phone number, and identify your role as either the Prime or Subcontractor.  

THIS SYNOPSIS IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT.  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.  NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS.  RESPONDENTS WILL NOT BE NOTIFIED OF THE RESULTS OF THE EVALUATION.  ALL INFORMATION SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT MUST ARRIVE ON OR BEFORE THE CLOSING DATE.

As such, USAID needs a contractor that can provide technical support to the PMO and perform as an integrator for strategic execution of “thought leadership” within USAID. The contractor needs to be an implementer of performance measurement to ensure consistency in meeting USAID’s President’s Management Agenda (PMA), Capital Investment Fund (CIF), Capital Planning and Investment Controls, and Joint Management Council (JMC) scorecard goals and progress; a catalyst to mature the PMO organization; and a spearhead for developing and implementing project and technical management best practices, strategy, process improvement, customer focus, benchmarking, technology, and quality processes to achieve quality products. USAID also needs a contractor to engage directly in all projects of the portfolio and to understand and help manage the relationship between projects within a portfolio and between all portfolios within an USAID program.

The following information is provided to assess the size and scope of the project task order:

1.	The contractor support workforce needed is estimated to be between 7-10 support personnel.
2.	The dollar value of the task order most likely will be between 500 thousand and 2.5 million per year. However, USAID will not establish any guaranteed dollar value for the newly established Blanket Purchase Agreement.
3.	The selected PMO support contractor will, as a minimum, supplement the PMO and its current contractor workforce. IBM Business Consulting Services is the existing PMO support contractor.
4.	Contractors providing services to the PMO will not be eligible to provide services under USAID’s Principal Resource for Information Management Enterprise-wide (PRIME) 2.2.
5.	Contractors providing services under the existing USAID Principal Resource for Information Management Enterprise-wide (PRIME) 2.2 task order and the Management Systems Technology Reform enterprise-wide Services (MSTR-e) Blanket Purchase Agreement are precluded from participation.
6.	The scope of the effort will focus initially on the following projects:
a.	Business Systems Modernization
i.	Phoenix Overseas Deployment (POD) – Upgrade of the current core accounting system and deployment of same to overseas missions and regional offices;
ii.	Joint Financial Management System (JFMS) – Implement project management standards support to JFMS and identify interdependencies with other projects and steady state resources.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Non Metallic Materials Division (AFRL/MLBC) of the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate desires to issue a sources sought announcement to identify potential U.S. sources and gather information on current capabilities within the domestic market.  This is not a request for competitive proposals; therefore, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in FAR 31.205-18, “Bid and Proposal Costs.”  Firms without domestic R&D and production capabilities are ineligible for any potential award. The NAICS code is 541710 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This technology is listed on the Military Critical Technology List (MCTL).  As a result, International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR) applies which requires the contractor to have a certified DD 2354, “Militarily Critical Technical Data Agreement.  

The Materials and Manufacturing Directorate is contemplating a procurement developing the materials and manufacturing technologies needed to demonstrate advanced carbon-carbon nosetips for reentry vehicles.

<SUBJECT>J -- Design and Overhaul/Conversion of the USNS Vessel CAPABLE
<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the conversion design and overhaul/conversion of USNS CAPABLE (T-AGOS -16) to support a NOAA ocean exploration mission. NOAA intends to issue an RFP in March 2005 soliciting industry competition for performing a contract-level conversion design and overhaul/conversion of the vessel. This vessel will be a versatile platform enabling multi-mission capability with cutting edge research and development in ocean exploration. Modifications for ocean exploration may include:
•	Installation of a multi-beam sonar system for deep water ocean mapping
•	Installation of a dynamic positioning system and modification/upgrade of the ship’s propulsion system to support dynamic positioning
•	Installation of handling system(s) for remotely operated vehicle (ROV) operations and modification to the aft deck to support ROV operations
•	Installation of a satellite dish and electronics to support broadband satellite transmission of optical data
•	Installation of oceanographic winches and J-frame
•	Installation of new laboratory and work spaces
•	Rearrangement of existing habitability spaces 
Overhaul of other ship systems and components will also be required based on condition assessment. The conversion design will be completed within a 6-8 month timeframe with drawings and data available for the government's evaluation at periodic design reviews throughout this step. The conversion of the vessel is expected to cover a twelve (12) to fifteen (15) month performance period during which the contractor will execute the vessel's conversion design. It is anticipated this requirement will be 100% set-aside for small business. For further information, call Contracting Officer Paul Reed at (206) 526-6034, email Paul.J.Reed@noaa.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Development and Commercialization of Agents for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Tumors Expressing EPO Receptor
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Collaborator to work with NINDS in the development, manufacture and commercialization of agents for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors expressing EPO receptor (EPOR). Of particular interest are agents useful in diagnosis or treatment of multiple tumors in different organs in patients with von Hippel-Landau (VHL) disease, sporadic kidney tumors and kidney tumors in dialysis patients.  NINDS is seeking a development and commercialization partner for identification of agents that act as antagonist to EPO, especially ligands that bind EPOR but do not activate the receptor.

Potential Areas of Application
•	Treatment and diagnosis of multiple tumors in different organs in patients with von Hippel- Landau patients
•	Treatment and diagnosis of renal tumors in sporadic and kidney dialysis patients
•	Treatment and diagnosis of pheochromocytomas in sporadic and hypertension patients
•	Treatment and diagnosis of eye and CNS hemangioblastomas 

Main Advantages of Technology/Invention:
•	We have found co-expression of EPO and EPOR in tumors of VHL patients. The co-expression of the ligand and receptor are related to the tumor growth and progression. Since the co-expression of EPO and EPOR are not present in most normal adult tissues, ligands that bind to EPOR but not activate the receptor can target specific tumor cells with minimal detrimental effect on normal cells. 
•	Since co-expression of EPO and EPOR is only transiently present in early embryo cells, detection of the co-expression of these proteins in tumor cells can be used for diagnosis of specific tumor cells.

Current State of Development
•	In vitro studies of tumor cell samples from a variety of tumors from von Hippel-Landau patients indicate that expression of EPOR is upregulated in these tumor cells.
•	Some of the tumor cell lines such as a kidney tumor cell line have been developed. Other tumor cell lines such as hemangioblastoma cell line from VHL patient can be cultured in the presence of EPO in the culture media. These cell lines can be used to test the effect of EPO agonist and antagonist on their growth. 

Further R&D Required:
•	Identify ligands that bind to EPOR but do not activate receptor
•	Screen ligands for activity in vitro or in vivo
•	Plan for clinical trials  to determine usefulness of ligands in diagnosing and/or treating tumors

Patent Status:
•	Patent pending 
•	Licensing of technology available

<SUBJECT>A -- Indolicidin Derivatives: Potent Inhibitors of HIV-1 Integrase For Treatment of Retroviral Infection and HIV
<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) seeks a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) collaborator to develop a series of short peptides derived from indolicidin.  These peptides exhibit potent anti-retroviral activity by inhibiting HIV-1 integrase and possess higher antiviral and anti-integrase activity than indolicidin itself.  


Potential Commercial Applications:
•	Treatment of retroviral infections such as AIDS. 
•	These compounds may be used alone, or in combination with other anti-viral therapies directed at other viral targets such as protease and reverse transcriptase.

Main Advantages of the Technology:
•	Potential for high clinical utility since HIV-1 integrase is essential for viral replication and no counterpart exists in mammalian cells.

Current State of Development:
•	Testing of tetrameric peptides show that these oligomers inhibit the action of integrase at nanomolar concentrations.

Further R&D Required:
•	Enhancing the transport properties of the current agents
•	Evaluating toxicology and efficacy in vivo.

Patent Status:
•	Three U.S. Patent Applications filed 1/06/2004, 2/25/2004, and 8/10/2004

<SUBJECT>--SPECIAL NOTICE FROM THE HONORABLE MICHAEL WYNNE, ACTING UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE (AT&L), SUBJECT: IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICE (IED) ACTIVE PROTECTION SYSTEMS
<DESC>As part of DoDs continuing efforts to accelerate the development of systems to protect our warfighters in Iraq and elsewhere, the Department is requesting that U.S. industry, laboratories, and inventors generate as many creative ideas as possible to  counter the improvised explosive device (IED) threat. IEDs are one of the most lethal threats encountered by our brave young men and women in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Even as the Department is rushing to provide additional add-on armor for vehicles to help our soldiers survive an IED attack, for now and in the future, it is more effective to detect and defeat an IED before it has a chance to detonate.   	A year ago, the Department established the Joint IED Defeat Task Force consisting of members of the Department and other government agencies to take a holistic approach to defeating the IED threat.  The Task Force is working to combine synergistic affects  of non-conventional solutions, tactics, techniques, and procedures that increase the safety of our coalition forces in theater.  A Technical Support Working Group and numerous government agencies are supporting the Task Force initiatives.   On or around 1 February 2005, the Joint IED Task Force plans to release another Broad Area Announcement that seeks solutions from industry partners to defeat the IED threat.  Specific information will be released in the Broad Area Announcement.  Current an d prospective industry partners should survey the Requests for Solicitations at the following web sites:  https://www.bids.tswg.gov or www.fedbizopps.gov .  Use key word searches such as IED Defeat.   	I encourage all industry to review the Broad Area Announcements when they are published in early 2005 on the FedBizOpps and Technical Support Working Group Bids portals.  If you feel your idea is responsive to our requirements, please submit it.

<DESC>Notice of intent to award sole source.  The Air Force Research Laboratory Propulsion Directorate (AFRL/PR) Edwards AFB, CA intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract for research and testing on Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsequioxanes (POSS) Polyimides to ITN Energy Systems Inc., 8130 Shaffer Parkway, Littleton, CO, 80127.  Preliminary studies show that polyimides with incorporated nanostructured Si-O frameworks known as POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes) have significantly extended usable lifetimes in simulated Lower Earth Orbit (LEO) environments.  In fact, after simulated LEO exposure, erosion yields of 10 and 20 weight % POSS Polyimide samples were 3.7 and 0.98 percent, respectively, of the erosion yield for state of the art Kapton H polyimide at a fluence of 8.5 x 1020 O atoms cm-2. POSS offers major advantages over conventional filler technology such as significantly improved oxidation resistance, enhanced compatibilization throughout the polymer matrix, increased modulus and temperature stability, reduced thermal expansion coefficients, and lower densities.  Our focus is for using these materials in specific DoD applications for space structures.

Access to Restricted Technical Information:  Restricted technical information is available to qualified offerors and will be provided upon request from the Technical POC.  Only U.S. Contractors who are registered and certified with the Defense Logistics Services Center (DLSC), Federal Center, Battle Creek, MI 49017-3084 (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose may have access to this information.  If you are registered with the DLSC, you must submit a copy of the approved DD Form 2345, Military Critical Technical Data Agreement, with your request for the data. 

The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Sources that believe they have the capability under this requirement may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified Government point of contact no later than 1:00 p.m. local time, on 20 Jan 2005.  Such capabilities and qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice.  If you have any specific questions, please email the Contract Negotiator at marc.venzon@edwards.af.mil. Note 22 applies. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541710 with a size standard of 1,000.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Office of Security Technologies (CTO), is sponsoring a Technology Readiness Evaluation (TRE 05-A) for explosives detection systems for inspection of break bulk air cargo.  The laboratory and field test for TRE 05-A is scheduled for the 3QFY05 timeframe, and will examine both the effectiveness and suitability of candidate systems.  It is anticipated that additional TRE announcements will be released during the fiscal year and will be standardized, recurring venues for commercial vendors and academic and government laboratories, to have their technologies tested and evaluated in both field and laboratory environments. Future TREs will focus on additional air cargo screening requirements in the following areas: containerized air cargo, palletized air cargo, and mail.

OPERATIONAL FOCUS

The focus of TRE 05-A is to evaluate technologies and systems designed to screen break bulk air cargo for explosive threats.  Air cargo includes, but is not limited to the following: printed matter, electronic equipment, machine parts, wearing apparel, medical supplies, other dry goods, fresh cut flowers, fresh seafood, fresh produce, tropical fish, human remains, and other perishable goods.  


GOAL 

TSA’s goal is to enable a wide variety of potential technologies and systems to be presented for evaluation under the TRE process, and assignments of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) to these systems.  Both automated and non-automated detection devices will be considered for inclusion in the TRE on a space-available basis. 

TECHNOLOGY MATURITY

Technologies and systems at various stages of the maturity may apply under this TRE; however, priority will be given to Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) systems and Non-Developmental Items (NDI) that can be readily deployed to enhance air cargo security.  

RESPONDENT BENEFITS

The TRE 05-A will offer respondents a unique opportunity to obtain effectiveness and suitability data that can be used in their developmental work, regardless of the TRL that they demonstrate.  Further, information obtained through the TRE process may result in future procurement opportunities for detection equipment.  Although the intent of TRE 05-A is to identify promising explosives detection technologies and systems, the TSA is under no obligation to select any of the participating technologies/systems for inclusion in the TRE, nor for future acquisition efforts.  

PROCESS

The process that will be used in the TRE will be a down-select process based on respondent-provided information which is summarized below: This multi-stage down-select process will be used for all respondents and technologies.
  
•	Step One – Respondent Submission of Completed Quad Chart and Review 
Submissions of interest will be requested to submit a more detailed White Paper.
•	Step Two – Government Request for White Paper to Selected Respondents
White Paper requirements will be provided directly to selected respondents and it is anticipated that there will be a short turnaround time required for submission of  the White Paper.
•	Step Three - Respondent Submission of White Paper and Review
Respondents whose White Papers are favorably evaluated will be invited to participate in laboratory and/or field testing. 
•	Step Four – Government Invitation to Participate in the TRE 05-A
Requirements for Step 4 will be provided to those vendors invited to participate in the TRE 05-A. During Step 4 of the TRE process, invited respondents will be required to provide one device at no charge to the government for test purposes, and be required to support, operate and/or train system operators, and maintain the device during the test period.  Respondents will be required to bear all costs associated with shipping the sample to the TRE evaluation site, providing installation support, training, and removal of the sample from the TRE at the end of testing.  The TRE testing process will last for approximately two months (from setup to shutdown).  Test units will be required to be onsite NLT one week prior to test conduct.  TRE test locations for laboratory and/or field testing events are to be determined.  All data/information collected during or in preparation of this TRE will be treated as proprietary. 

REQUIREMENTS 

STEP 1: QUAD CHART SUBMISSION

The information below provides the key detail that is required in the submission.  The respondent shall complete the following information in the form of a quad chart as outlined below.  

Block 1 – Picture:

Respondents must provide an electronic picture of the technology system in operating state as Block 1 of the quad chart deliverable.

Block 2 – Description

Provide information describing the system and detection technology employed, including:
•	Inspection area in which the system can be used (Must verify that system can be used for inspecting break-bulk air cargo).
•	A brief discussion of the technology the system uses to detect the presence of explosives.
•	The physical characteristics of the system including size, weight, inspection item limitations, power/voltage requirements, any unique support requirements, and other pertinent information.

Block 3 – Capability

Provide information describing the system capabilities including:
•	The projected effectiveness of the system:
o	Types and quantities of explosives the system can detect
o	System probability of detection level
o	False alarm rates
o	Throughput rate on an hourly basis (items inspected/hour)
o	Time it takes to evaluate a test item (minutes)
•	Systems suitability for use:
o	Safety & health factors associated with system use.
&#61607;	The system must be safe for use by operators and non-injurious to the cargo being screened.
&#61607;	Respondents will provide information on any classes of articles that cannot be safely inspected by the system.

Block 4 – Viability

•	System lifecycle costs:
o	Acquisition costs for a single system
o	System operating costs on an annual basis
o	Anticipated system life expectancy in years
o	Maintenance Costs on an annual basis
o	Mean Time Between Failures
o	Mean Time to Repair

•	Respondent system maturity assessment (choose one):
o	Proof-of-concept prototype	
o	Developmental item
o	Commercially-available product.

SUBMISSION

To be considered for inclusion in this TRE, respondents must complete the quad chart listed under Step 1 (see quad sheet Attachment 1) and send it by e-mail to Sheila.Roche@dhs.gov to the Transportation Security Administration, [Attention: Sheila K.

W81C3943432307 	1 Each  RG223/U Cable, 19AWG, 50 OHM, COAXIAL Question 1:  We have identified the cable.  The quantity states 1 ea - we are assuming this means one reel.  Can you confirm the length of cable required for this reel, i.e., 500 feet.  ANSWER: 1 reel of 500ft. W81C3943432308	25 Each  J TYPE WIRE ,  20 AWG, Thermocouple Components. Question 2:  We have identiifed the thermocouple.  The quantity states 25 each - can you confirm the lengths required for this one as well. ANSWER: We need 25 reels at 25 ft a reel.

Please clarify quantity desired. ANSWER:  We need 25 reels at 25 ft a reel. W81C3943432311 	25 each   Adapter P/N: NOREF, Connector, Double Binding Posts to BNC Male. Question 4:  Item 6 (PR above) is the description of Item 0005 (W81C3943432310) P/N 1296.  Does the requester want 50 pcs or is this a duplication? ANSWER:  we want 25 of P/N 1296.

We only need 25 reels at 25 ft a reel. Question 7:  Item 2 requests a Part No RG223/U Cable.  The description fails to specify length or the type or terminations on the ends of the cable.  My assumption from the context of the solicitation is that the manufacturer is Pomona and the part number is2249-Y; however, length (e.g., 6 in., 12in. 24in., 36in., 48in., etc) would still need to be specified. ANSWER:  same as question 1.  same cable.  We only need the 1 reel of 500ft. Question 8: Item 6 request an adapter with no part number.  The description matches the Pomona Part NO. 1296, which is requested in Line Item 005. ANSWER:  we ordered 4 different types of connectors from Pomona.  P/N 1269, P/N 1270, P/N 1296, P/N 1452. Question 9:  Item 10 requests a Part No  5318A.  This part number is missing a digit.  Part number should be 53181A, Frequency Counter. ANSWER:  Correct:  Part No: should be 53181A counter. Question 10:  Item 10 - HP 5318A is a long discontinued HP counter.  Do you instead mean the 53181A? ANSWER:  yes Question 11:  Item 2:  1 each of P/N RG223/U Cable - Quantity desired?  (typically these are avilable in spools of 100 ft, 500 ft, or 1000 ft). ANSWER:  same as question 1.  same cable.  We only need the 1 reel of 500ft Question 12:  Item 3:  25 each of P/N J Type - Quantity desired?  (Again, typically spools of 100 ft, 500 ft, or 1000 ft) ANSWER:  same as question 2 and 3.  We only need 25 reels at 25 ft a reel.   Question 13:  Item 6:  25 each of No Referenced P/N - By description, this appears to be a duplicate of item 5; Pomona P/N 1296. ANSWER:  same as question 8.   Question 14:  Item 10:  1 each of P/N 5318A - Agilent lists this part as 53181A. ANSWER:  yes. Question 15:  Item 3:  J TYPE Wire, 20 awg, Thermocouple:     1.  What length and termination style is desired?  25 reels at 25 ft a reel   2. Please clarify quantity units desired.  25 reels    3.

Teflon insulation Question 16:  Item 2:  1 each, Part No.  RG223/U Cable 19  AWG 50 OHM COAXIAL; What is the length of this cable? ANSWER:  same as question 1.  same cable.   Question 17:  Item 6:  No Referenced Part No.  Adapter, Connector, Double Binding Posts to BNC Male, Pomona;  When it says double binding post, does that mean banana plug?  Our assumption is that is the case, but we don't know for sure. ANSWER:  same as question 8.   Question 18:  Item 10:  HP/FLUKE, 1 each, Part No 5318A:   our assumption is that this is a typo and should read 53181A.  Is that true? ANSWER:  same as question 9.   CORRECTIONS: Item 5: Part No 1296 Change to: Part No. 1270 Item 6: No Referenced Part No.  Change to:  Part No. 1296 Item 10:  Part No. 5318A Change to: Part No. 53181A All other information remains the same.
