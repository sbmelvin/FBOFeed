<CONTACT>J. Paul Hardin, Contracting Officer, 210-977-3493
<DESC>The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. CPSG is embarking on a major cryptographic modernization (CM) program for space telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C).  A major goal of the program is to avoid ground equipment offered uniquely for space applications. Utilizing standard terrestrial COMSEC products reduces non-recurring engineering (NRE) from unique development, reduces per unit production costs, reduces life cycle costs, and leverages standard logistics/sustainment practices.  The first step is to show that legacy space algorithms can be loaded and operated on existing CM compliant ECUs. Beginning in FY06, we anticipate initiating a spiral development approach for space algorithm capabilities on terrestrial COMSEC products. This effort is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that terrestrial field re-programmable COMSEC products with CM features can replace legacy space COMSEC equipment.  Specifically, we want to demonstrate that the KG-46 and KG-57 algorithms can be loaded into and operate on existing CM compliant End Cryptographic Units.  We don’t intend to preclude solutions which may require an external interface ancillary outside the INFOSEC boundary.

<DESC>1.  The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.<br> <br> 2.  CPSG is developing a new generation of TT&C cryptographic devices to meet the needs of national security space programs and the Cryptographic Modernization (CM) program.  These new devices will be used to protect satellite and ground station command uplinks and telemetry downlinks from disruption or exploitation by non-authorized parties.   The Cryptologic Systems Group's Special Projects Directorate (CPSG/ZJ) is the developing program office assigned with the task of acquiring these cryptographic devices to support the modernization of Space TT&C for both satellite and ground control stations. <br> <br> 3.  CPSG intends to award a single contract to modify an existing Crypto-Modernized terrestrial re-programmable COMSEC product, with an option for production.  This modified COMSEC product will be used to replace existing/legacy Ground Operating Equipment (GOE) as well as a near term solution for new satellite ground stations.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB), plans to procure, on a sole source basis, for a measurement of serum and tissue hormone assays from samples collected from men of several ethnic groups to investigate whether serum levels of hormones reflect intraporstatic androgenicity in prostate tissue, from the University of California, Keck School of Medicine, WCH 1M2, 9032, 1240 North Mission Road, Los Angeles, CA 90033.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.

The HREB is carrying out a methodologic study in several ethnic groups, including U.S. and China, to investigate whether serum levels of hormones reflect intraprostatic androgenicity.  The primary objective of the Prostate Tissue Study is to correlate serum and tissue levels of hormones in order to understand whether serum levels of hormones in reflect cellular androgenicity in prostate tissue.  The Prostate Tissue Study is collecting serum and tissue samples from African Americans, Caucasians, Asian Americans, and Chinese men living in China, diagnosed with prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or bladder cancer undergoing prostatectomy.  Hormone levels in prostatic tissue will be measured and compared with serum levels and polymorphisms of hormone-related genes.  This study is the first of its kind to investigate androgenicity in target tissue directly and will help guide future epidemiologic studies on prostrate cancer.

The University of Southern California will measure 270 serum and tissue hormones by radioimmunoassay.  Serum and tissue levels of testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 3 alpha diol G, estrone, estradio, androstenedione, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) will be measured in the 270 serum and tissue samples.  Estrone, estradiol, androstenedione, and testosterone would be quantified by extraction/chromatographic RIAs, and 3-diol G and SHBG by direct chemiluminescent immunoassays.    

The University of Southern California School of Medicine is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because they are the only lab that passed the pilot test that can perform both serum and tissue assays reliably.  This is the only lab that can perform estrogen assays using the column separation method prior to radioimmunoassay.  This method provides reliable and accurate androgen and estrogen measurement in serum and in tissue.  Most labs now perform direct assay using RIA kit purchased from manufacturer. This kind of assay has large cross-reactivity and is not suitable for estrogen assays in male samples.  The main reason is that their assay is different and is specific enough to measure estrone and estradiol accurately. Other assays do not have this capability due to cross reaction of the assays. 
 
This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can provide the above services, and has the support of the above listed partners, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by September 22, 2006 at 1 PM.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or sent via electronic mail to Malinda Holdcraft at mh139x@nih.gov.    A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in and have valid certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.

The GEB is conducting a case-control study of kidney cancer.  The purpose of the study is to investigate a number of environmental, occupational, and personal risk factors for kidney cancer.  NCI has collected formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor material from 200 non-clear cell renal tumors.  Paraffin-embedded tissue blocks and frozen tissue were also obtained, and frozen tumor material from 80% of cases with paraffin blocks.  Pathology tissue from cancer patients provides increasing opportunities for the study of biological questions relevant to tumor etiology and for detecting early markers of disease.  Pathology specimens provide a resource for examining DNA to screen for mutation in renal cancer susceptibility genes including Birt-Hogg-Dube (BHD), MET and fumarate hydratase (FH), and can be used to compare tumors that are associated with different risk factors, thus strengthening associations that might be made between exposures and disease.  To accomplish this, DNA tumor samples will be screened for FH and MET gene mutations and evaluation of the role of mutations in the BHD in the etiology of chromophobe and oncocytoma RCC by screening for the BHD gene mutation.

Transgenomic, Inc. will receive 10 samples each month, slides and tumor DNA, to design amplicons for each target fragment for analysis of exons of BHD, FH, and MET genes.

Transgenomic, Inc. is the only contractor known to the NCI that is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because they have developed a unique technological approach using a combination of Surveyor Nuclease, DHPLC, and direct DNA sequencing for mutation detection.  The quality control and their technological approach are best for the mutation detection of the samples.  The sensitivity and specificity of the technology used by Transgenomic will provide results that are more informative

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), plans to procure, on a sole source basis, for Mutational Spectrum Analysis of the Von Hippel Lindau Gene in Kidney Tumors from Cases enrolled in the Eastern European Renal Cell Cancer Study from Transgenomic, Inc., 12325 Emmet Street, Omaha, NE 68164.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.

The OEEB is studying the variability of kidney cancer across Central and Eastern European countries that are from a low of 9.0 per 100,000 men in Budapest to a high of 17.0 per 100,000 men in the Czech Republic.  The countries of Central and Eastern Europe have experienced serious occupational and environmental health problems because of insufficient resources for improvement of old fashioned technologies and replacement of worn out equipment to reduce exposures.  The greater chance and more diverse levels of exposures to occupational carcinogens in this part of the world present a unique opportunity to assess the risks of cancer.  Transgenomic will perform an analysis of the mutational spectrum of exons 1-3 of the VHL gene for approximately 400 DNA samples extracted from frozen tumors.  The DNA samples are from the cases enrolled in the Central and Eastern European RCC case-control study.  For approximately 20% of these samples, (N=80), promoter hypermethylation analysis of the VHL gene will also be conducted.  

Transgenomic, Inc. is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because they are the only laboratory that analyzes promoter hypermethylation using bisulfite treated DNA and sequence analysis.  Additionally, Transgenomic previously performed VHL mutational spectrum analysis and a pilot study of VHL promoter hypermethylation for the Central and Eastern European RCC study with high throughput that will allow for comparability of the results from these analyses to the previous study.

<DESC>In accordance with Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), plans to procure on a sole source basis, for the Detection and Identification of Chlamydai trachomatis (CT) genotypes to assess the relationship with the risk for human papillomavirus (HPV) persistence and risk of cervical cancer. With Delft DDL Diagnostic Laboratory, 2275 CX Voorburg, The Netherlands.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541380 and the business size standard is $11M.

As a result of the CT screening for the NIH sponsored HPV vaccine trial conducted in Guanacaste, Costa Rica, CT was found to be highly prevalent.  The extremely high point prevalence indicates that CT could be an important part of HPV infections.   However, CT has not been studied prospectively with large numbers based on the best DNA methods to determine the variety within a heterogeneous group.   Using the 1100 stored DNA specimens from the prospective work in Guanacaste from the HPV vaccine trial and natural history, the relationship can be studied utilizing the novel multiplex PCR assay.  Contractor shall analyze 1,100 specimens (previously extracted for DNA under a previous contract).  Unused, extracted DNA shall be stored at -80oC.  The contractor shall document lot numbers of kits used for extraction and any ascertainment of DNA quality.  An Excel file shall be provided to the NCI for each batch with the following data: Identifier, extraction date, test date, kit lot, name of laboratory technician performing the assay, and CT results.  Data for any controls shall also be provided. The contractor shall also provide bpm files of scanned blots (48/image) and any data generated from any image analysis of the blots in an Excel file.  The contractor shall document any failed tests.  

The Delft Diagnostic Laboratory is the only contractor known to the NCI and is uniquely qualified to carry out this effort because they have developed a new PCR-based CT genotyping method known as the Hybrid Capture? 2 CT/GC DNA Test.  In order to reliably identify single and mixed infections of CT genotypes, a reverse hybridization method was developed.  This assay first permits identification of the three major CT serogroups, i.e. the B-complex, the C-complex, and the intermediate complex.  Secondly, the assay further determines the presence of specific serovars within each of the three serogroups:  Serovars B, Ba, D, Da, E, L1, L2, L2a (serogroup B), serovars A, C, H, I, Ia, J, K and L3 (serogroup C) and serovars F, G, and Ga (intermediate group).

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Gene DX, Inc, 207 Perry Pkwy, Gaithersburg, MD, 20877.  This purchase is to provide training for fellows enrolled in the Metropolitan Washington, D.C. Medical Genetics Residency Program.  In order to meet the board certification of competency the trainees must have laboratory experiences in cytogenetics, biochemical genetics and molecular genetics.  It is further necessary for the trainees to see patients with genetic disorders under the direction of an ABMG board certified geneticist.  The lab experiences must include molecular diagnostic testing in neurodegenerative disorders, late onset disorders, imprinting disorders, mental retardation, neuromuscular disorders and metabolic diseases.  The evaluation criteria that will be utilized to review the response submitted in response to this solicitation will be as follows: 1) understanding of the technical requirements and specifications of the equipment; 2) qualifications of personnel; and 3) past performance. 

The sole source determination is based upon the fact that due to the wide array of molecular diagnostics testing required there are no other programs in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area that provides such extensive training.  Awarding this purchase order to another organization would result in deficient training of the fellows working in the laboratories of NHGRI and thus would effect the ongoing laboratory research and threaten the investments already made by the government.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541990 and the Size Standard is $6.5M.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis for consideration in any future requirements.

<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Consolidated Operations Acquisitions Center (COAC) for the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to Lynn K. Baumeister, 9039 Sligo Creek Pkwy Ste 1715, Silver Spring, MD 20901-3358.  This is to conduct usability evaluations on the My Family Health Portrait (MFHP) - a web-based tool that allows individuals to record their family health history.  Along with various agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the Surgeon General created a new computerized tool to help make it fun and easy for anyone to create a sophisticated portrait of his or her family?s health.  As a result of a survey, several additional features are in the process of being implemented.  An evaluation of the web-based tool with all of its old and new features must be tested and evaluated before being released to the public.  This is to be done in three phases: 1-targeted informal usability testing on mockups of specific screens; 2-comprehensive usability testing on MFHP; 3-measure satisfaction levels (post launch of new features).  The evaluation criteria that will be utilized to review the response submitted in response to this solicitation will be as follows: 1) understanding of the technical requirements and specifications of the equipment; 2) qualifications of personnel; and 3) past performance. 

The sole source determination is based on the fact that Ms. Baumeister has been involved in analyzing feedback collected in previous surveys of this tool.  Her understanding of the projects history, objectives, and team structure gives her a unique knowledge and experience that would be valuable to this effort.  By awarding this contract to someone else the government would lose both time and money in training.  Ms. Baumeister  would be able to continue with work already begun under P.O. MD515004.  The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541519 and the Size Standard is $23.0M.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6, Competition Requirements.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) intents to procure professional services, on a sole source basis, from Henry Lewis, Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, FL.  			
Period of Performance:

September 29, 2006 through September 28, 2007 with three (4) additional one-year options.

Background:

In 1991 the National Library of Medicine's Specialized Information Services (SIS)  Division commenced a one-year pilot initiative referred to as TIOP (the Toxicology Information Outreach Project).  Its modest but important mission was to strengthen the capacity of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to train health professionals to use NLM's Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program databases.  Representatives of eight HBCUs attended the first TIOP meeting, held at NLM in August of that year.  In the more than fifteen years since its inception, the project has strengthened the link between NLM and HBCUs to a point where by the year 2000 nearly 80 minority institutions had received training under the TIOP program.  

NLM has reengineered TIOP, which is now called EnHIOP, the Environmental Health Information Outreach Program. EnHIOP builds upon the original TIOP, but now also includes a stronger focus on environmental health, minority health and health disparities. EnHIOP also includes a larger and more diverse groups of institutions, smaller HBCUs beyond those with graduate programs in the health sciences, as well as tribal colleges and Hispanic serving institutions. 

Purpose:

There are three major activities to be accomplished by this purchase order.  It will be the decision of the contractor to best decide the method of completing these tasks.  Evaluation of outcomes is an important component of all NLM outreach activities.

Task 1:  The contractor will provide guidance to NLM in the management and development of EnHIOP and other related initiatives involving minority serving educational institutions.

Task 2:  Carry out administrative activities related to serving as chair of EnHIOP such as preparing materials for meetings, preparing reports and analyses.

Task 3:  As requested by NLM, represent EnHIOP at professional meetings and conferences including giving presentations about EnHIOP and NLM and promoting health information access for minorities.

Sole Source Justification
Dr. Lewis is the only contractor known to NLM that is uniquely qualified to carry out the tasks of the SOW and assist NLM in this requirement due to his academic background and excellent connections with administrators of minority serving educational institutions.  Dr. Lewis has Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from FAMU and a Doctor of Pharmacy degree from Mercer University School of Pharmacy.  In addition, Dr. Lewis has experience as chair of EnHIOP.

This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations, nor is an RFQ available. However, all responsive sources may submit a capabilities statement in a timely manner that will be considered by the Government. Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  
 
The quoter shall include all information which documents and/or supports the qualification criteria in one clearly marked section of its quotation. 

Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Robin Hope-Williams, Contract Specialist, NLM on (301) 435-4379.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition procedures, the National Library of Medicine (NLM) intents to procure professional services, on a sole source basis, from Melvin Spann, Ph.D., SGH Medtech Consult, Inc., Silver Spring, MD.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6.5 Mil.
			
Period of Performance:

September 29, 2006 through September 28, 2007 with 3 one-year options

Background

Over the past half century, the nation's investment in scientific research has resulted in unprecedented revolutionary progress in biological, medical, and material sciences. Information technology holds the promise of delivering specific knowledge in a timely manner to billions of people worldwide, in ways undreamed of even a short time ago. The National Library of Medicine (NLM), in pursuit of its longstanding mission to acquire, organize, and disseminate health-related information, now has the opportunity to provide near-instantaneous reliable access to high quality health information resources when and where decisions are made. The support of NIH's efforts to understand and eliminate health disparities between minority and majority populations is an integral part of NLM's mission. (National Library of Medicine Strategic Plan for Addressing Health Disparities 2004-2008)

NLM has developed a framework for its minority outreach programs and is continually building upon this to develop and maintain a robust program of information outreach to minority groups ? both at the professional level and the consumer level.

Purpose

There are four major activities to be accomplished by this purchase order.  It will be the decision of the contractor to best decide the method of completing these tasks.  Evaluation of outcomes is an important component of all NLM outreach activities.

Task 1:  The contractor will work with community- and faith-based organizations to increase their awareness of NLM as a resource for medical information.  The contractor will provide training to these organizations on methods to obtain this information.  The primary goal is to promote health information.

Task 2:  The contractor will work the NLM and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on increasing the amount of information available to Latin America for disaster preparedness.  The contractor with provide consultation to NLM on the current project that NLM is conducting with CRID on capacity development in Central America.

Task 3:  The contractor will work with minority organization and professional associations to assist in the development of partnerships and collaborative activities.  This may include attending national meetings of minority organizations with the goal of making these organizations aware of the NLM, its programs and services, including consumer health resources and job opportunities.  This may include speaking at conferences hosted by minority health professional organizations such as the National Medical Association and working with NLM staff to develop and implement meetings on topics such as minority participation in clinical trials.

Task 4:  The contractor will work with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other minority educational institutions to increase their awareness of medical informatics and telemedicine.  This includes serving as executive secretary of the new membership panel for the NLM Environmental Health Information Outreach Program and a member of the executive committee.  The contractor will provide input to NLM on the identification of new panel members, programming, and collaborations.

Sole Source Justification

Dr. Spann has a Ph.D. in Chemistry/Computers Systems and MS in Chemistry/Information Science and Technology and is recognized nationally as an expert in scientific information storage and retrieval.  In addition, he is keenly knowledgeable about the NLM?s information services.  Because of his expertise and experience in this area, he is uniquely qualified to work with community and faith-based organizations, PAHO, HBCUs and other minority organizations to increase their awareness of NLM as a valuable resource for medical information and telemedicine applications.  Dr. Spann has extensive experience working with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and a successful track record of working with minority organizations and institutions.

This project will re-establish the creek drainage system and will reduce sediment deposition in the creek while providing trail access to heavy pedestrian and equestrian traffic.  The work is expected to start in late September-early October 2006 and shall be completed within 45 days after receipt of a Notice to Proceed.  The estimated project range is between $25,000-$100,000.

<DESC>SECTION 1:  	PURPOSE:

The IRS has the need to improve Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Tax Exempt Status, processing and data quality.  Therefore, the IRS is considering alternative strategies and perhaps, more importantly, a greater private sector role in assisting the IRS in its efforts.   
 

Including strategic partnerships with the private sector offers the opportunity to: 

1.	Improve the attractiveness of using IRS certified software to complete their Form 1023;  
2.	Improve the quality of the submission which would result in reduction of filer burden; and
3.	Achieve potentially significant cost savings for both the IRS and strategic partners through the use of advanced technologies.

The IRS Business Operating Division for Tax Exempt and Government Entities (TE/GE) is requesting participation from software developers and other interested parties, such as law firms that develop and submit Forms 1023 for clients, Trade Associations, etc.,  ("strategic partners") that would have an interest in partnering with the IRS to conduct a one year application beta test. The strategic partners, during the one year test, should be interested in incorporating this application into their own suite of products and/or services.  The strategic partners would take ownership of the IRS built application and would make changes based on their own market needs.  The strategic partners would be expected to market their version of the beta test application and provide users for testing TE/GE will cooperate with strategic partners in the implementation of a web-based automated tool, "Cyber-Assistant," for use by applicants completing the IRS Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Tax Exempt Status under section 501(c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The applicants would also be required to submit a user fee along with the application.  The IRS expects that partners would use the fully operational Form 1023 application which includes IRS approved supporting documentation as a base for their product.    

The IRS would consider offering incentives to increase the use of the Form 1023 application offered by partners.  The Forms 1023 submitted to IRS using the software will be coded with a developers identification number to track applications from the various partners.  Incentive to encourage use of the partner?s product could be reduced user/application fees.  


    
The government does not intend to issue a task order for this work.  The purpose of this RFI is to describe the general nature of the IRS need, the information desired of industry, and to provide instructions for submission of industry responses. 


SECTION 2:   	INSTRUCTIONS AND RESPONSE GUIDELINES: 

To assist you in understanding this request, we have provided a background of the IRS Cyber Assistant application.  Following this information is the specific information, Section 6, RFI (Requested) Response, that we are requesting interested parties to complete and provide in their Technical Capability Statements.  

Responses are limited to a total of 50 pages and must be completed in Microsoft Word format. Page size must be "8.5 x 11", font must be 12 point or larger, and margins must be at least 1". Briefly describe your company, your services, history, ownership, financial information, business size, other information you deem relevant, and respond to the specific inquiries in Section 6. Supplemental service brochures or marketing materials outlining specifications and capabilities may be submitted, and will not be counted in the overall page count limits. Provide points of contact, including name, address, phone/fax number(s) and e-mail. 

We appreciate your response.  It will be used solely by the IRS as market research to select interested and qualified partners to participate in the development and test.  We will not divulge the specifics of individual responses to the RFI outside of the IRS Requirements Team.  When possible the Cyber Assistant Requirements Team will conduct analysis without identifying company names with their responses.  Prospective participants will be required to sign appropriate nondisclosures for the test period. 

SECTION 3:	 	INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDENTS:
 
Please provide your response to this RFI by 5:00 PM on October 11, 2006.  Responses should be sent as an MS Word attachment.  You may also submit supplemental hardcopy materials such as brochures, etc., to the Contract Specialist.

SECTION 4:	BACKGROUND:

TE/GE's "Cyber Assistant" is a web-based tool for guiding users through the process of completing an IRS Form 1023.  It is intended to meet both internal IRS needs and the needs of newly created organizations that may be staffed by volunteers, as well as their professional advisors, to complete the IRS Form 1023 with the goal of becoming recognized as a tax-exempt 501(c) (3) private foundation or public charity.

TE/GE expects to receive about 60,000 such applications per year for review and has experienced annual growth in the number of these receipts of 3-5%.  The "Cyber-Assistant" tool shall enable applicants to  be guided with appropriate educational content, consistent with IRS instructions to the Form 1023, version 06/2006, Application for Recognition of Exemption under section 501(c ) (3), to input required information for IRS review, and create a paper Form 1023 application, and required attachments,  The application shall create standard 2-D barcodes on the printed forms, containing the information supplied by the applicant and contained in the completed Form 1023.  

The Form 1023 "cyber" application produced by the Cyber Assistant application is to be finalized and printed and submitted to the IRS through the mail via United States Postal Service or other delivery service.  The partners shall utilize approved IRS Business Rules and schema in XML format as a base for their own application.  The user-friendly web-based application shall guide users through the process of completing the form, provide online context-specific help and quick access to a glossary, and include validation routines to ensure that all required questions have been completed.  

A Form 1023 application package is specific to a single Exempt Organization (EO) and an EO can have only one application package.  A package comprises the 1023 application itself (divided into several sections per the IRS Form 1023), schedules thereto, and related forms as indicated on the Form 1023 Checklist (including the Checklist itself as well as Forms 2848, 8821 and 5768 which typically accompany the Form 1023 if the applicant has executed a Power of Attorney or other authorization for representation).  A package also includes attachment pages ("internal attachments") providing data entered via Cyber Assistant that cannot fit in the limited space of the forms (including lengthy explanations and lists) and separator pages to act as cover sheets for documents ("external attachments") not entered via Cyber Assistant, but which are to be included in the 1023 application package that is mailed to the IRS.

By improving the quality of the responses on the IRS Form 1023, the IRS expects to increase its ability to process the applications via a streamlined review process, thus saving IRS resources.  Second, the increased efficiency could result in decreasing the time it takes to process the application. Third, by providing a series of standard 2-D barcodes on the printed forms, the Form 1023 application produced by the Cyber Assistant application or system will enable the IRS to convert the responses on the Form 1023 into data that can be stored and analyzed by the IRS.  

To the degree that Cyber-Assistant developers conform to the IRS core content, the IRS expects to consider a reduction in applicable user fees for such applications, in order to encourage their use.  

The release of Cyber Assistant that will incorporate the design described in this document will interact with other IRS systems only to the extent that the paper output printed from the PDF versions of the 1023 application packages will be scannable.  It is anticipated that Cyber Assistant will be extended in future releases to support electronic submission of application packages. 

SECTION 5:		STATEMENT OF NEED:

The purpose of this RFI is to determine if developers are interested in participating with the IRS in a controlled development and test of a Cyber Assistant application during for a one year period.  IRS is interested in working with developers and other interested parties with the technical expertise in like development efforts.  The data from the Cyber Assistant system will be received by the IRS system via 2-D bar-coded paper Form 1023s.  The data from the 2-D barcodes will be in the form of XML.  As discussed above, this will enable the IRS to store users' Form 1023 responses in a database where the data can be analyzed, viewed, or aggregated.  It is essential that the data provided in the barcodes be linked to their corresponding fields or elements in the IRS system where the data will ultimately reside and that the Cyber Assistant data provide sufficient granularity to provide all the necessary data for the IRS storage system.

The information supplied in the Form 1023 application by applicants is considered taxpayer return information and is protected from public disclosure by the IRS by section 6104 of the IRC up to and until review by the IRS is completed, and the applicant receives its IRS determination letter.  Upon closing of the file, and the issuance of the determination letter, the Form 1023 application and disclosable parts of the administrative file are subject to public disclosure.  Security of the non-disclosable information on any external website during the application preparation process is between the applicant and the service provider, and is not guaranteed or warranted as secure from public disclosure by the IRS until it is actually received in the IRS.  When received by the IRS, appropriate security and privacy standards are in place.   


SECTION 6:		REQUESTED RESPONSE:

Please provide an affirmative statement as part of your response if you have experience with and are interested in the type of work described in this RFI.  Also provide your previous experience with successful management and performance of work similar to that described in the "Statement of Need" section of this RFI to include, but not limited to, development and submission of Forms 1023.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA), Region II, intends to negotiate with Stanley Security Solutions, Inc., 350 7 Avenue, New York, NY 10001 on a sole-source basis for the addition of four CCTV cameras and related equipment to the existing system at the Addabbo Federal Building in Queens, New York. These varied components must integrate with existing building design, space and appurtenances established for system repair or modification.           Stanley Security Solutions currently maintains the CCTV security system at the Addabbo Building under contract as the subcontractor to Brooks Range Contract Services, SSA's mechanical maintenance contractor.       Stanley Security Solutions has performed alterations to the existing system components in the security system and is fully responsible for all aspects of the operation and maintenance of the CCTV security system.     SSA intends to negotiate directly with Stanley Security Solutions so as to comply with contractual (Maintenance & Warranty) agreements already in place, and ensure a smooth and rapid response and clear line of accountability for all mechanical breakdowns, thus minimizing disruption to operations, while maintaining limited down time of the CCTV security system. The Government will consider all information from responsible sources that is submitted to the point of contact by close of business on September 18, 2006, but a determination by the Government not to compete this action is solely at the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<SOLNBR>W911QY06R0015
<RESPDATE>092506
<ARCHDATE>11242006
<CONTACT>Roberta Boswell, 508-233-4946
<DESC>The US Army Soldier Systems Center, Product Manager  Force Sustainment Systems, Natick, MA, has a requirement for a Commercial Precision Airdrop System that will fulfill the need for several increased capabilities such as ground accuracy, standoff d elivery, air carrier survivability, and overall improved effectiveness regarding airdrop mission operations. This Commercial Precision Airdrop System will be used with standard equipment utilized for the delivery of Containerized Delivery System (CDS) load s as described in Field Manual (FM) 10-500-3, shall have the following performance characteristics: The commercial precision airdrop system shall provide a steerable, gliding type device capable of delivering standard containerized delivery system (CDS) lo ads weighing 900-2,400 lbs (T) or 701-2,400 lbs (O) from altitudes of 24,500 feet mean sea level (MSL).  When released from the threshold altitude of 24,500 feet MSL, the system shall have an autonomous delivery capability that is able to accurately naviga te from a high offset aerial release point, to within a 150 meter radius of the intended impact point (PI) at an 80 percent frequency rate.  This acquisition will be conducted as a full and open competition (including non-US companies) to evaluate all syst ems now available in the marketplace that meet the JPADS 2K requirements. A competitive range will be established and offerors of proposals which fall within the range will be requested to participate in a shared government/contractor funded demonstration of their proposed system. The prototype systems need not comply with the Berry Amendment, which will be airdropped, and the systems, as well as the project teams demonstrated knowledge, experience, and technical and managerial approach, will evaluated aga inst performance requirements. A down select to one offeror shall comply with the Berry Amendment, will be conducted based on results from the offerors initial proposal, the system demonstration, a technical demonstration report, and the offerors Best an d Final Offer (BAFO).  A Firm Fixed Price - Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract will then be awarded to the offeror with the highest potential to meet the evaluation criteria outlined herein, and within the JPADS 2K programs schedu le  and budget constraints. Although the intent of this acquisition is to utilize a COTS precision airdrop system, it is probable that the offeror whose system may be chosen will require an indefinite amount of systems engineering and contractor support to  fully meet the requirements. The contract will allow for the following development phases to be conducted:  Base effort to include Design Validation (DV), Developmental/Operational Testing (DT/OT), Production Delivery Order.  The DV and DT/OT phases will be included within the base period of performance and include CLINs for the recurring delivery of supplies and/or services in the form of commercial precision airdrop systems, spare parts repairs, system engineering, contractor training, and contractor tes t support. The requirement for those items may vary with each respective test effort, and will not be known at the time of contract award. It is anticipated that the base period of performance will require a minimum of eight (8) commercial precision airdro p systems.  These test items will undergo evaluation for fit, form and function, and be subjected to airdrop testing.  Upon successful completion of the DV phase the Government will initiate the Developmental/Operational Testing (DT/OT) Phase.  This phase may require the delivery of additional commercial precision airdrop systems to conduct DT, followed by the delivery of additional production representative commercial precision airdrop systems to conduct OT.  These items will be subjected to DT/OT to deter mine if they satisfy all the JPADS 2K requirements identified in the Capabilities Development Document (CDD).  The DT/OT phase will also include the requireme nt for the delivery of a Technical Data Package (TDP) (to include complete drawings, lists, and detailed specifications).  Lastly, successful completion of DT/OT testing will allow for the optional production contract phase to be initiated. Under this opti onal period of performance phase of the contract a Production Delivery Order (Firm Fixed Price) may be issued to meet the Army's initial estimated fielding requirements of approximately 96 JPADS 2K units.  Follow on production contracts may be awarded, bas ed on the TDP, to acquire the remainder of the Armys estimated fielding requirements of precision airdrop systems.  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be posted on the Soldier Systems Center web site located at https://www3.natick.army.mil/, under Busine ss Opportunities/Upcoming Acquisitions/W911QY-06-R-0015 on or about October, 2006. NO hardcopies will be mailed. Telephone calls will not be accepted. Questions may be sent to Roberta Boswell, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at roberta.boswell@natick.army. mil.  Firms will not be reimbursed for any cost associated with proposal preparation.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to award a sole source purchase order to Johnson Controls, Inc. located at 60 Loveton Circle, Sparks, Maryland 21152-0889 to convert SSA Headquarters' Child Care Center building automation system from Trane to Johnson Controls, Inc.  The proposed contract action is to provide the necessary parts, equipment, installation, and programming services to successfully achieve the conversion and maintenance services.  This procurement is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures described in FAR Part 13.

This notice is for informational purposes only and is neither a Request for Quotation nor an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation.   Interested parties that believe they are capable of providing these supplies and services are requested to submit a capability statement to Bridget Hamel via email at bridget.hamel@ssa.gov no later than 4:00 pm, EST, September 13, 2006.

<DESC>This announcement is a Market Survey/Request for Information.  This announcement IS NOT A SCREENING INFORMATION REQUEST (SIR) OR REQUEST FOR OFFER (RFO) of any kind.  Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to this Market Survey/Request for Information.  Therefore, any costs associated with Market Survey/Request for Information submissions will be solely at the interested party's expense. The purpose of this Market Survey/Request for Information is to improve the Government's understanding of the current marketplace, obtain information on available resources, technology and innovative approaches that may fulfill its mission need, and gain insight into industry capabilities and best practices. Attachment A describes the performance requirements that must be addressed.  Attachment B is the vendor response template.  Interested vendors are required to provide full and complete responses to the items in Attachment B.  Special emphasis is being placed on identifying innovative solutions to meet the FAA's need for a Power Per Hour (PPH) engine maintenance coverage program for their fourteen (14) Pratt & Whitney 305A engines and also for identifying performance criteria and best practices that will improve the quality of the FAA's proposed acquisition.  Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.  Respondents to the Market Survey/Request For Information may be requested to provide additional clarification information at the option of the Government.  No evaluation of vendors will occur and vendor participation in any informational session is not a promise of future business with the FAA.  Information obtained from Attachment B will be used to support the development of an acquisition strategy for a PPH engine maintenance coverage program. At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  This market survey is being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small business concerns, or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement using other competitive procurement procedures.  The principal North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 336412, with a size standard of 1000 employees.  Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form, and if applicable, a copy of their SBA SEDB 8(A) Certification letter. The failure to obtain adequate and appropriate small business participation in this Markey Survey MAY result in a determination to conduct this procurement under full and open competitive procedures. All responses (one response per company) are to be provided on company letterhead and limited to a total of 20 pages taking into account the page count limitations specified in Attachment B.  No type font less than 12-point may be used.  Any proprietary information submitted will be protected if appropriately marked.  All responses, including attachments, should be submitted electronically to the following email address: richard.conyac@faa.gov.  (Reference market survey DTFAAC-06-S-000201).

Also please note that the FAA e-mail server restricts file size to 10MB per e-mail, therefore responses may have to be submitted in more than one e-mail in order to be received.

<DESC>The following replaces the previous announcement in its entirety. We apologize for any confusion caused by the initial submission.<br> <br> 1.	The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. <br> <br> 2.	CPSG is developing a new generation of TT&C cryptographic devices to meet the needs of national security space programs and the Cryptographic Modernization (CM) program.  These new devices will be used to protect satellite and ground station command uplinks and telemetry downlinks from disruption or exploitation by non-authorized parties.  The Cryptologic Systems Group's Special Projects Directorate (CPSG/ZJ) is the developing program office assigned with the task of acquiring these cryptographic devices to support the modernization of Space TT&C for both satellite and ground control stations. <br> <br> 3.	CPSG intends to award a single contract to modify an existing Crypto-Modernized terrestrial re-programmable COMSEC product, with an option for production.  This modified COMSEC product will be used to replace existing/legacy Ground Operating Equipment (GOE) as well as a near term solution for new satellite ground stations.  The modified End Cryptographic Unit (ECU) will replace legacy GOE that implements the KG 28/46, KG-29/57, KI-23, CARDHOLDER, and BELSHAZZAR algorithms.  In order to meet the requirement of new ground stations the ECU will need to provide higher data rates and modern cryptographic features.  The final ECU will be NSA Type 1 certified. <br> <br> 4.	Please provide answers to the following questions.  Your responses will be used in market research for this acquisition.  Please send responses via email no later than 20 December 2005 to: <br> jeffrey.hardin@lackland.af.mil<br> <br> a.	Are you interested in competing for this requirement?  If so, will you be proposing as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor? <br> b.	Are you a Small Business?  If so, what is your small business status, e.g., 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, etc? <br> c.	Do you have similar experience in development and/or production of these type devices?  Please describe your experience in one or two paragraphs. <br> <br>  See Note 26.

Description
The Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) Program, Wright-Patterson AFB, OH is surveying the market to determine potential sources qualified to perform JPATS Ground Based Training System (GBTS) Contractor Logistics Support (CLS).  We anticipate a 5 to 10 year contract with support beginning on 01 July 2007.

BACKGROUND

GBTS was developed and procured as part of the JPATS program with Raytheon Aircraft Corporation (RAC) as the prime contractor.  RAC is currently providing GBTS CLS and is responsible for integration of the T-6A aircraft with GBTS.  The GBTS and associated CLS was developed to support training operations for the maximum student and instructor training load at each training site. The GBTS has three major functional areas:  Courseware, Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs), and the Training Integration Management System (TIMS).

There are five different types of Aircrew Training Devices (ATDs) in training operations.  Three of these are Flight Training Devices used to teach students normal and emergency procedures as defined in the Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) syllabus.  All three utilize the same Central Training Complex (CTC).  This includes a full functioning replica of the T-6 front seat cockpit and the same Instructor Operating Station (IOS).  Each simulator has no motion.  Each has five PC computers that run the IOS, the host, the flight deck I/O, the aural cueing system and the electronic control loading.  The primary difference in the devices is the level of corresponding visual system.  The Unit Training Device (UTD) has no visual system.  The Instrument Flight Trainer (IFT) has a 45 X 33 degree visual and the Operational Flight Trainer has a 270 X 70 degree visual.  Both use the same visual databases and a common Vital 9 or 10 Visual Control Computer and Image Generator.  Both also use forward projection Barco CRT projectors.  The IFT uses one and the OFT uses five.

The other two ATDs are used for teaching emergency and ground egress and include the Egress Procedures Trainer (EPT) and the Ejection Seat Trainer (EST).  The EPT replicates the forward cockpit of the T-6A with non-functioning instruments and a moving stick and throttle.  It also has a canopy that replicates the opening forces of the A/C.  The EST is a standalone mock-up of the A/C ejection seat and allows the student to practice strap-in and ejection procedures.  A student is given an aural indication when ejection has been properly initiated.

The Courseware consists of Developed and Standardized courses and their associated syllabi.  The T-6 Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) student, T-6 Pilot Instructor Training (PIT) and admin courseware (which teaches users how to use the GBTS) are developed courseware.  The courseware was developed using Authorware.  Standardized courses include courseware for other undergraduate training platforms.

TIMS was designed to manage all Air Force and Navy undergraduate flying training programs (T-6, T-37, T-1A, T-38C, T-34, TH-57, etc.)  TIMS operates on Windows 2000 clustered servers, SQL 2000 databases and Windows XP clients.  Portions of TIMS, developed with Microsoft .NET, require an application server.  The core TIMS development environment includes Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (Visual Basic, C++, C# and Java).     

CURRENT ENVIRONMENT

RAC is currently responsible for integration of all GBTS components.

On-Site ATD support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, and NAS Pensacola.  At the Air Force locations, the contractor provides required manning, spare parts, and support equipment to meet mission effectiveness of 95%.  There are financial penalties for not meeting the mission effectiveness.  The Government does not own ATD spares at Air Force Locations.  At the Navy location, the contractor provides manning, support equipment and replenishes Government owned spare parts.  Maintenance actions and spare parts usage are tracked using Magic Service Desk.

On-Site TIMS Computer Aided Instruction (CAI) support is provided at Randolph AFB, Moody AFB, Laughlin AFB, Columbus AFB, Vance AFB and Sheppard AFB.  Each of these locations has CLS for the CAI labs and a Helpdesk (takes and responds to calls and walk-ins, enters trouble tickets, performs system administration and database administration, etc.).

Randolph AFB has one CAI lab in bldg. 740
Moody AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 709
Laughlin AFB has two CAI labs (one right above the other) in bldg. 328
Columbus AFB has two CAI labs in bldg. 230 and 268
Vance AFB has two labs in CAI bldg. 672
Sheppard AFB has one CAI labs in bldg. 2320

Randolph AFB is the central site for the Modification and Update Support System (MUSS) which makes changes and distributes these changes to other GBTS locations.  The MUSS supports:
ATD software and visual database maintenance
Developed courseware (i.e. CAI Graphics, Test Bank Questions, Syllabus Management)
Standardized courseware integration, quality checks, syllabus management and distribution
TIMS software maintenance (additional support provided at contractor location)
Systems and Sustaining engineering (support provided at contractor location)


FOLLOW-ON CLS CHALLENGES AND EXPECTATIONS

The required support will not include on-site ATD maintenance support for the Navy.  Excluding the Navy sites, the total support provided will be no less than the support described in the current environment above.  Support will be required to integrate T-6 and ATD production changes into the fielded GBTS.  TIMS MUSS support will require Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) Level 3 certification as a minimum.  The contract type is anticipated to be fixed price with some T&M effort.

Interested sources should submit information that describes in-house capability and what might be subcontracted.  Provide experience and knowledge of:
1.     Simulator support
2.     Courseware support
3.     Training management systems and IT systems administration
4.     Software certification level
5.     Undergraduate/graduate flying training

If you have already responded to a prior sources sought announcement for this effort, updates may be submitted to address any changes contained herein.  Any comments to the documents for this effort may be addressed to the contracts representative, Ms. Lisa Adams, Lisa.Adams@wpafb.af.mil, or Ms. Michelle Hendricks, Michelle.Hendricks@wpafb.af.mil.

Information contained in this synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.

<DESC>The Navy has a small purchase requirement for Information Technology technical services.  The NAVFAC Engineering Command developed the Public Works Center Management Information System (PWCMIS) to keep track of the financial and production information used by the FECs.  DWAS replaced PWCMIS, but does not extend or distribute labor data, which is done by the Labor Management Support Information System (LMSIS). The Micro Computer Data Entry Program (MDEP) provides for different methods for update in LSMIS or DWAS.  LMSIS, MDEP and the Legacy Application Migration Database (LAMDB) require technical and interface support in accordance with the government Statement of Work.  The Navy requires approximately four (4) man-years of support effort with a man-year equivalent to 2,080 hours to include vacation and leave.  The period of performance is for one year.  Most of the funding will be provided early in fiscal year 2007.  This acquisition is unrestricted.  Contract award will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal is compliant with the solicitation, and is determined to be best value to the government considering technical (resumes), price, and other factors considered.  Award will be made under simplified acquisition procedures outlined in FAR Parts 12 and 13.  The point of contact is Naomi Melendez, 202-685-8051.  The solicitation will be made available the week of 5 September 2006 with closing 12 September 2006.  The proposal may be obtained at: http://esol.navfac.navy.mil or upon request.

<DESC>The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) intends to award to Ms. Su-Anne Robyn Charlery on a sole-source basis using (FAR 13.106-3 Simplified Acquisition techniques for a Professional Service Gender Research Coordinator with NIDA intern program for NIH National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities. The background of the project includes working in the NIDAs Women & Gender Research Coordinator coordinates within-Institute activities relating to research on womens health and sex/gender differences, serves as the NIDA representative to the NIH Office of Research on Womens Health Coordinating Committee on Womens Health, and serves as chair of NIDAs Women and Gender Research Group (WGRG).  In these capacities, responsibilities of the Coordinator include programmatic planning and coordination of drug abuse research on womens health and sex/gender differences; promoting and facilitating high-quality research applications in this area; information sharing within the Institute and among ICs; responding to inquiries from DHHS, the NIH Office of Research on Womens Health, the scientific research community, and the public; dissemination of research findings to the research community and to the public; and liaison activities with professional organizations.  Activities to be conducted include the following: Use NIH grants databases including CRISP, Quick View and QVR, as well as Reference Manager to complete and maintain a database of NIDA-awarded grants dealing with women and sex/gender differences. Use the NIH library utilities including PubMed, PsychInfo, Online Journals, and Porpoise to identify and compile drug abuse research articles dealing with women, gender differences and drug abuse. Prepare reviews of NIDA-supported research published during years 2005-2006 on women and sex/gender differences in various NIDA-wide areas of research including basic human and animal laboratory research,  adolescence, HIV/AIDS, prevention and treatment. Using data from national surveys such as the National Survey on Drug Use and Health and Monitoring the Future, construct graphs for PowerPoint presentation showing sex differences in drug abuse.  
Other literature review and PowerPoint presentations as needed.
The priority and due dates of the activities will be determined by the Women & Gender Research Coordinator.  Specific due dates within each project are subject to change depending upon changing opportunities and priorities within the Women and Sex/Gender Differences Program. Ms. Charlery has been actively engaged in most of activities described above and is currently available to continue these activities.  Because she is trained in these activities, her continuation in these activities will prevent loss of progress that would occur if a new contractor were hired.  Hiring a new person would require a long training period and consequent down time on these projects as well as considerable training effort by the Women & Gender Research Coordinator, thus taking her away from other obligations.  Therefore, awarding the contract to Ms. Charlery will be cost effective for the government so as to avoid unnecessary training delays and to ensure timely and efficient completion of these tasks.  In addition, Ms. Charlery is uniquely qualified given her background and expertise in areas related to the tasks described above.  She received a Bachelor?s Degree in Psychology with an emphasis in psychobiology in May 2006, she has laboratory experience with both humans and animals, and she has experience in data collection, analysis and evaluation, as well as presentation of research at a major regional psychology conference.  She has served as a developmental neurobiology research intern conducting immunohistochemical assays on incubated chick brains, and in research with humans, she conducted behavioral assessments on adolescent participants in drug abuse research.  Further, she has the necessary software and NIH database expertise.  She is experienced in the use of Excel, PowerPoint, Reference Manager and NIH Library utilities including PubMed, PsychInfo, Online Journals, and Porpoise.  And she has rexperience in the use of NIH grants databases including CRISP, Quick View and QVR.  This Notice is a not a Request for Quote. Interested parties may identify their interest to this requirement in writing by the posting end date [box#2] of this notice.


AMENDMENT ONE DATED 09/08/2006 HEREBY DELETES NOI600117 IN ITS ENTIRETY.  IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE GOVERNMENT TO CANCEL THE NOI600117 AND REISSUE AS FULL AND OPEN AFTER EXCLUSION OF SOURCES (SMALL BUSINESS SET ASIDE.)

AMENDMENT TWO (2)

This amendment is in response to questions received via email.

#20.  On page 15 of the general information section, you state that the response must not exceed 15 pages.  Does this apply just to the technical approach section?  For the total proposal to be less than 15 pages, we will be extremely limited on details of past performance, cost breakdown, and resumes.  

Answer: We could not count resumes in the 15 page response. 

#21.  On page 2 of the Statement of Work you refer to a website for approved products on the enterprise architecture for NIH.  We looked at this list and found that it is two years old.  Some of the products listed are obsolete and/or have changed names.  Is an updated list available? 

Answer:  This is the most up to date list we have 

#22.  Is IBM Content Manager an approved product for the NIH enterprise architecture?  An updated list might show if it is or not. 

Answer:  My understanding is that this page http://enterprisearchitecture.nih.gov/ArchLib/AT/TA/WebContentManagementSystemBrick.htm is the most current CIT/NIH has to offer, so if you don?t find it on the list you could use the contact link on the site to ask for an update.

<DESC>The following question have been asked regarding solication number W15QKN-06-R- 0323.  1.  Q-  The synopsis references Government Furnished Material for LAP.   Are these also part of this solicitation effort?    A-  Regarding the GFM, we  meant that these items will be provided as GFM to the LAPing facility.  2.  Q-     Would the contractor be required to work with energetic materials?  A-  The  contractor is not required to work with energetic materials. 3.  Q-  In one of  the Cone Tail TDPs, there is a drawing, 9327838 on the PDF file. I only  received page 1 of 2. I assume that page 2 will be on the CD version?  A-  The  drawing is referring to the body load assembly drawing. It is called out in  the parts list for the tail cone. It is there for reference. Page 2 was not  included in the package as it is not necessary to make the tail cone. 4.   Q-   I am a bit confused about what it is you want to purhase.  The individual line  items only list the name of the item.  But according to Mr. Markowitch, at  least for the "tailcones", you don't want the whole assy (part not to  include "obturating band and the body load assy.")  May I suggest that dwg #s  be used i/l/o or in addition to the name of the components.  There is no  component called a "body load assy" on the talicone dwg or p/l.  A-  The  drawings I am referring to are 9327838, Projectile 81mm Smoke RP M819 Loading  assembly, and 9310339 Ring Obturating.  The loading assembly is listed in the  tail cone assembly parts list as a reference drawing.  Ring Obturating is also  listed in the parts list but is not being purchased as part of  this  procurement. 5.  Q-  The solicitation states assembly of components. The  drawings also indicate products used in the assembly. Am I to understand that only the body tube (drwg 9327837) a tail cone (934962A) are to be quoted?  A-  "They are to make the entire body tube and tail cone assemblies.  This is to  include assembly."

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to issue a sole source procurement to  Beckman Coulter Inc., 250 S. Kraemer Blvd., Brea, CA under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This procurement is to obtain an Aliquoter Upgrade to the existing Total Laboratory Automation System.  This upgrade has the ability to eliminate the manual process of aliquotting specimens sent to reference laboratories and other laboratory sections outside of the Core Laboratory, and provide for automated labeling of the secondary aliquot tubes and specimen transfer process.  This Upgrade consists of a Serum Level Detector to determine the interface between the cell clot and the silicon separator, transmit specimen volume information to the automation system computer and use information to calculate the available serum;  a Secondary Tube Labeler to print bar-coded labels and apply to up to three aliquot tubes; and an Aliquot Unit to accept primary specimen tube and aliquot the specimen into the secondary aliquot tube.  Using the information from the automation system computer, it then dispenses the exact amount of specimen required for each aliquot tube.  The Aliquoter Upgrade is to be used in conjunction with the current Total Laboratory Automation System and must be able to be integrated with the existing automation system and laboratory instruments.  It is the belief of the Government that there is currently only one responsible source capable of providing this equipment to satisfy the agency requirement.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  This is not a request for competitive quotes; however, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification, accompanied by supporting evidence in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements, to the contracting officer within ten (10) days from the date of publication of this synopsis.  All responses must be in writing via e-mail to Cheryl.Weidner@med.va.gov or faxed to 412-365-5451.  If no responses are received, VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System will proceed with the sole source procurement from Beckman Coulter.

-	identify and mitigate risks
-	control costs and use Earned Value Management techniques  
·	Financial capability to perform a cost reimbursement contract (including whether the company has a DCAA/DCMA approved accounting system, approved purchasing system, approved estimating system, etc. and whether the company has current Forward Pricing Rate Agreements with a DCAA/DCMA point(s) of contact)

Any information provided as a result of this sources sought synopsis is voluntary and the Government will not pay for any information submitted.  Interested offerors shall submit 3 hard copies of their capability package to the following address: 55CONS/LGCZ, Attn: Sheila Rollins, 101 Washington Square, Offutt AFB NE 68113-2107, no later than 4:00 p.m. local time 28 July 2006.

<CONTACT>J. Paul Hardin, Contracting Officer, 210-977-3493
<DESC>Request for Information (RFI) for GROUND OPERATING EQUIPMENT (GOE) INCREMENT 1<br> <br> 1.  The Cryptologic Systems Group (CPSG), Special Projects Directorate at Lackland AFB, TX is soliciting your comments in response to several questions below.  This RFI is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposals.  Any formal solicitation will be announced separately.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. <br> <br> 2.   CPSG is embarking on a major cryptographic modernization (CM) program for space telemetry, tracking and control (TT&C).  A major goal of the program is to avoid ground equipment offered uniquely for space applications. Utilizing standard terrestrial COMSEC products reduces non-recurring engineering (NRE) from unique development, reduces per unit production costs, reduces life cycle costs, and leverages standard logistics/sustainment practices.  The first step is to show that legacy space algorithms can be loaded and operated on existing CM compliant ECUs. Beginning in FY06, we anticipate initiating a spiral development approach for space algorithm capabilities on terrestrial COMSEC products. <br> <br> 3.   This effort is a proof-of-concept to demonstrate that terrestrial field re-programmable COMSEC products with CM features can replace legacy space COMSEC equipment.  Specifically, we want to demonstrate that the KG-46 and KG-57 algorithms can be loaded into and operate on existing CM compliant End Cryptographic Units.  We don't intend to preclude solutions which may require an external interface ancillary outside the INFOSEC boundary. <br> <br> 4.   Please provide answers to the following questions.  Your responses will be used in market research for this acquisition.  Please send responses via email no later than 14 December 2005 to: jeffrey.hardin@lackland.af.mil<br> <br> a.  Are you interested in competing for this requirement?  If so, will you be proposing as a Prime Contractor or Subcontractor? <br> <br> b.  Are you a Small Business?  If so, what is your small business status, e.g., 8(a), Small Disadvantaged Business, etc? <br> <br> c.  Do you have similar experience in development and/or production of these type devices?  Please describe your experience in one or two paragraphs. <br> <br> See Note 26.

<DESC>This is not a notice of RFQ issuance. The Air Force is seeking sources capable of performing this requirement.  Interested sources should e-mail a technical capability package to TSgt Jennifer LaShawn Nalls at Jennifer.nalls@wpafb.af.mil no later than 1500 EST 14 September 2006.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516. This requirement is to provide a MULTIFUNCTIONAL, REAL TIME QUANTITATIVE SURFACE ANALYTICAL IMAGING SYSTEM with IN-SITU EXPERIMENTATION CAPABILITY and MULTI-ANALYTICAL TOOLS.  The equipment is needed for ultra-thin analysis of thin surface films.  The major technical system requirements that meet the Government's needs are 

a)	The instrument must have the following analytical techniques and tools: Imaging XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy), Auger Spectroscopy, UPS (Ultraviolet Photoemission Spectroscopy), Ion Scattering, In situ heating and cooling.  Having these analytical tools will allow new capabilities for experimentation that will fulfill our research needs.  

b)	The instrument must have a hemispherical analyzer size of 160mm or above.  This feature provides for the needed energy resolution for our applications.

c)	The instrument must be able to provide real time, high spatial resolution (4 micron spatial resolution) imaging that can provide quantitative chemical state information without surface damage.  This feature will allow us to perform real time in-situ experiments on several scales, from macro to micro scales, and will provide quantitative composition and chemical state data.

d)	The instrument must have a co-axial electron flood source for charge neutralization.  This will allow for in-situ experiments to be run without interference from side-angle flood sources.

e)	The instrument must have the spectroscopy and imaging detector in the same plane.  This allows for exact alignment control between the spectroscopy and imaging detection systems. 

f)	The instrument must have greater than 100 detector elements during spectroscopy mode.  This is needed for increased sensitivity of high resolution chemical state information.

g)	The instrument must have a greater than or equal to 500mm Rowland circle x-ray monochromator.  This provides improved spectral resolution that is needed for our tasks.  

h)	The instrument must have chamber geometry that is compatible to customization for future experiments. Our research needs/goals change with time and the instrument must be able to adapt to our changing research directions.
 
In response to this notice, offerors shall submit a technical capability package demonstrating the capability to provide the above requirements.  Personal visits to discuss this project will not be scheduled.  For all questions concerning this acquisition contact TSgt Jennifer LaShawn Nalls at Jennifer.nalls@wpafb.af.mil or 937-522-4550.

<SUBJECT>R -- Total Asset Visibility Phase 1B
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-TAV1B
<RESPDATE>092006
<CONTACT>Aaron Ford, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-646-4215, Fax 202-646-3679, Email aaron.ford@associates.dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), seeks to identify potential sources that are capable of performing the continued implementation and operation of the Total Asset Visibility (TAV) logistics system.  A Blanket Purchase Agreement, with STRATIX Corporation, 4920 Avalon Ridge Parkway, Norcross, Georgia 30071-1572, was awarded for the delivery of Phase I of the TAV system.  DESCRIPTION:  The TAV logistics system is a Commercial off the Shelf (COTS) system that consists of three principal components, namely the Warehouse Management (WM) module, the Trading Partner Management (TPM) module, and the Orbitrax GPS tracking module.  The WM module handles all inventory functions within the FEMA logistic centers (warehouses) in Atlanta, Georgia and Fort Worth, Texas.  The Trading Partner Management (TPM) module handles shipping of all commodities and assets among locations within Region IV and VI.  TPM is used by FEMA logistics managers to identify commodities stored at the various logistic centers that are to be distributed to State and local authorities and disaster victims.  Orders are prepared in TPM and sent to logistic centers in WM where the stock is pulled from the warehouse, prepared, and shipped to the specified locations.  In the near future, FEMA logistics managers will also use TPM to place orders with commercial entities and other Federal Agencies for goods and materials to replenish the stock of the logistic centers.  The Orbitrax GPS tracking module, provided by OrbitOne, is a one-way satellite transmitter affixed to trailers carrying disaster commodities from the logistic centers to the disaster theater.  The WM and TPM modules are provided by Manhattan Associates.  The WM module consists of multiple Linux Red Hat and Windows 2003 servers that host the application, web user interface, integration, and Oracle database.  Within the FEMA logistics centers the WM application is accessed over wireless handheld scanning devices.  Tablet PCs run on the Microsoft Windows XP operating system and the wireless handheld scanners run on the Microsoft Pocket PC operating system.  Access security for the wireless warehouse devices is provided by Air Fortress software from Fortress Technologies.  The TPM application resides on servers running Microsoft 2003, IIS web server, and SQL server technologies.  TPM is accessed through the Internet using Microsoft Internet Explorer thin client and/or using VPN technology using iPass virtual private network software from iPass Inc. and Black Ice from Internet Security Systems Inc. for firewall protection.  Some of the commercial entities and Federal Agencies access TPM through the Internet after being granted access by FEMA.  Others are granted access to the system via broadband communication through the Internet using virtual private network (VPN) technology. The two applications, WM and TPM, exchange data through a secure FTP process using secure shell technology from Vandyke Software.  The tracking data from the Orbitrax system is accessed through TPM.  The serial number for an individual Orbitrax unit is tied to the shipment documentation in TPM; clicking on the serial number in TPM directs a user to the OrbitOne website where the shipment's geographic location can be viewed.  REQUIREMENTS:  The successful offeror must be able to continue the implementation, operation, support, and expansion of the TAV system.  Requirements to accomplish this include: (1) Maintenance of system hardware, including handheld readers and tablet computers; (2) Maintenance of GPS tracking devices provided by OrbitOne; (3) Maintenance and support of system software provided by Manhattan Associates; (4) The expansion of the WM and TPM modules.  FEMA currently owns sub-modules within WM and TPM that have not been activated; (5) The inclusion of additional Manhattan modules, as required; (6) The inclusion of additional Manhattan modules, as required; (7) The expansion of the TAV system to new locations, as required.  These locations may include additional FEMA logistic centers, other Federal partners, or vendor partners; (8) The ability to surge support staff in response to a disaster.  At a minimum, the contractor must have the capability to surge up to 100 people to support disaster response.  These people may be deployed to both headquarters and field locations.  RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS: Contractors, including small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and woman-owned small businesses are encouraged to participate. Foreign and domestic suppliers will be considered equally. Responses to this Sources Sought Notice should be limited to 25 pages or less and include supporting materials that allows for an effective evaluation of your company's/team?s competence, experience, and overall understanding of the scope of work that FEMA has identified. Submissions should include company history, company size, major products, primary customer base, points of contacts (able to discuss the submitted materials), and a description of past experience.  Contractors are to provide evidence of how they intend to be responsive to the urgent and short lead-time requirements.  Responses to this Sources Sought Notice are hereby requested by 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST), on 20 September 2006 to support the Government's milestone objectives.  Information should be e-mailed to Aaron H. Ford, Contracting Officer at both Aaron.Ford@associates.dhs.gov and Aaron.Ford1@dhs.gov.  Questions can be submitted electronically to both Aaron.Ford@associates.dhs.gov and Aaron.Ford1@dhs.gov .  Information provided shall be treated as Business Sensitive and will not be shared outside of Government activities and agencies without the permission of the provider. All information shall be provided free of charge to the Government.  The Federal Emergency Management Agency may request further information regarding the capabilities of respondents to meet the requirements and may request a presentation and/or a site visit as deemed necessary.

<DESC>The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense through the Executive Agency of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) anticipates the competitive award of a one-year follow-on pilot requirements contract to provide a centrally-managed source of Worke rs' Compensation Insurance as required by the statutorily mandated Defense Base Act (DBA).    This follow-on Centrally-Managed DBA insurance  pilot program is expected to provide further statistical and claims management data as a means to assess whether i t might be advantageous for the Department of Defense (reduction in rates, improvements in contractor participation in overseas procurements, establishing effective competition, expansion of the program beyond  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and all oth er factors considered) to award a contract under Phase II to one insurance carrier.  Under this follow-on pilot program, the contractor's requirement by law to provide overseas employees with insurance coverage pursuant to the Longshoremen's and Harbor Wor kers' Compensation Act/ Defense Base Act or DBA, would be centrally managed by a single insurance carrier during the contract duration, unless a waiver has been obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor.    The successful insurance carrier shall deal dire ctly with the companies requiring DBA insurance for payment arrangements and resolution of issues.  No Government funds will be allocated under any agreement or contract governing the administration of the Centrally-managed Pilot Program.  Reimbursement fo r DBA insurance will be under the appropriate USACE District/Center contract.   As intended by this Sources Sought, the Government is attempting to gather market research information.  Therefore, interested parties should  provide the following information:  (1)  Any historical data from the previous year to include average DBA Insura nce Rates by geographical location and by labor risk category; (2) a brief concept of operations statement for a centralized program in Phase II;  (3) advantages and disadvantages over the status-quo Phase I operation;  (4) and a brief description of poten tial for teaming and potential to reduce adverse impacts to the existing insurance industrial base, which includes all groups under the Small Business Act.  Responses should be sent to Lynn Harper, either via email at: lynn.m.harper@usace.army.mil or mail to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Humphreys Engineer Center Support Activity, Contracting Office, ATTN:  Lynn Harper, 7701 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA    22315.   Responses must be received no later than 1400 hrs, EST on 20 September 2006.    The existing Requirements Contract under the USACE Centrally-Managed DBA Pilot Program, Phase I, with The Continental Insurance Company, DBA CNA Insurance, 333 S. Wabash Ave, Chicago, IL, will expire on 30 November 2006.  The government reserves the right to extend that contract, in accordance with the terms of the contract, as necessary.  The enormous benefits demonstrated and realized by the government under the Phase I operation and the potential for even more savings and benefits has demanded that the g overnment under its stewardship responsibilities, complete the originally intended 2-years Pilot Program, which should end on or about 30 November 2007.  Additionally, Congress in the FY 2006 Authorization Act has requested a study of the DBA Insurance Pro gram operations in Defense of which the USACE Centrally-Managed Defense Base Act (DBA) Pilot Program is a central part of the DOD Study.

<DESC>This is Notice of Intent to Award for commercial services/items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This is a notice of intent to solicit and negotiate a sole-source order with  3Di Technologies, 105 Eastern Avenue Suite 204, Annapolis, Maryland 21403 for the purchase of seven (2) SIPRNet Tunneling Over Wide Area Network (STOW) VSAT and IP Telephony Systems. This agency intends to issue a purchase order for delivery and installation under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 ?Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.?  DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR?S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF ONLY ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE OR BRAND:  Over 50 SOF Team Locations (Middle East and Southeast Asia) are now using the 3DI VSAT / STOW / iDirect Broadband Satellite system for both Internet (SIPR and NIPR) and IP-Telephony operations.  Other manufactures equipment is not compatible due to iDirect proprietary TDMA equipment design.  Using the 3DI VSAT / STOW / iDirect Broadband Satellite system equipment maintains consistency with equipment at all SOF Team locations that can be managed by a single regionally located organization (3DI Technologies), using a common set of  monitoring software, spares and diagnostic software.  The 3DI VSAT / STOW / iDirect VSAT is a fully integrated Network with local Network Monitoring capability at forward locations that allows complete Network management capabilities in a privately controlled Network.  IP-Telephony Services are single service provider based, with full business class / enterprise calling features (multiline calling, call forwarding, call conferencing, voice mail, intercom and 4-digiti dialing between all Team locations etc.).  Provisioning an alternate Service Provider will not permit cross functionality between Team Location. The 3DI VSAT / STOW / iDirect VSAT has become the VSAT standard for many US Government Organizations (DoD, US State Department and OGA) operating in both the Iraqi Freedom and Afghanistan Operation Enduring Freedom Theaters.  3Di has established personnel competency to support programming of the field deployed KG-175 and KG-250 units required for SIPR operations, including the Network configuration and management of a Private IP Network permitting tightly controlled SIPR traffic routing through US Government approved Teleport facilities.  The approval to operate these systems comes form the Joint Staff, specifically the DISN Security Accreditation Working Group (DSAWG).  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice is not a request for quote.  The purchase request number is F2VWCG6180A100, and is being issued as a sole-source Request for Quotation.  The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses as those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-04.  This procurement is a sole-source Total Set-Aside for a Small Business in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.

<SUBJECT>R -- TSA - Man Portable Air Defense Systems Software Analysis
<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to issue a single source contract with Cunning Running Software, LTD of Romsey, Great Britain to provide software that it has previously developed in support of Man Portable Air Defense System (MANPADS) assessments for the TSA Law Enforcement Office.  This contract is not a software design contract, Cunning Running, LTD has already created the necessary software for this particular use.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has been tasked with the responsibility of securing our nations transportation systems.  Particularly, the Office of Security Assessments (OSA) is tasked with securing the commercial aviation community against the use of Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS).  Homeland Security Presidential Directives 5 and 7, the Aviation Transportation Security Act of 2001 (ATSA), and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 require us to conduct MANPADS Assessments at airports of high risk in the United States.

Due to the complexity of the assessment process and the intense manpower involved in conducting MANPADS and other stand-off weapons assessments, the Office of Security Assessments has a requirement for computer based analysis software that calculates complex algorithms in order to identify potential launch areas and threat profiles within the footprint of our nation?s airports.  The software must consider a variety of weapons system capabilities, geographic information, flight path analysis, and arbitrary map scales.  Additionally, it must support mitigation efforts by providing a platform to manage critical resources within a real-time operational environment.

The TSA needs this particular software immediately, and Cunning Running, LTD is currently the only vendor available that has this type of software immediately available.

<SUBJECT>--Draft Integrated Test and Analysis Contract (ITAC) Request for Proposal (RFP)
<DESC>The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/U.S. Army Forces Strategic Command (SMDC/ARSTRAT) requires an integration contractor team to plan, organize and coordinate operations/tests/analyses with comprehensive, widely distributed experimental w  eapons systems, or credible representations thereof, such as Ground Based Midcourse Missile Defense hardware/element labs, early warning radars, sea-based missile defense elements, mid and lower tier missile defense elements, or representative element sim u lations; and/or other equipment of interest, such as communications network hardware/simulation, command and control, and/or threat systems data.     Combinations may include, but are not limited to items such as weapons system Hardware-in-the-Loop (HWIL ) lab oratories, Software-in-the-Loop (SWIL), detailed (up to and including detailed engineering level) modeling and simulation (M&S) products, trustworthy databases reflecting detailed weapon system operations, threat system representations and /or any ot her as set required, for integrated test and analysis experiments.       Initial emphasis is expected by SMDC/ARSTRAT to be placed upon but not be limited to all varieties of missile defense operations (and related offensive operations) against threats in all phases of operational envelopes. Test and analysis experimental configurations are customer driven in accordance with directly stated objectives or derived from senior leadership expectations.     To perform this scope of work (SOW), SMDC/ARSTRAT and t he ITAC contra ctor shall seek out partnerships with DoD and other US Government organizations (and their lead contractor organizations) to obtain the requisite capabilities.     Task orders will be issued by the SMDC/ARSTRAT to accomplish the ITAC require ments.     Several US Government supported efforts are expected to be integrated into the performance of this contract through the use of directed subcontractors to the ITAC prime contractor. Each present or future Directed subcontractor is precluded from participating as a me mber of the prime team.     The Missile Defense System Exerciser (MDSE) developed by Teledyne Brown Engineering is expected to be heavily leveraged with the ITAC tasks, but the scope of ITAC is more comprehensive than just existing (c irca 2006) MDSE operation s.     Likewise, the Ground Based Midcourse Missile Defense Embedded Test (ET) capability developed by the Boeing Company is expected to be leveraged along with the Integrated System Test Capability (ISTC) resources and US Governm ent supported contractor radar laboratories operated by the Raytheon Company.  The NAICS code for this small business set-aside competition is 541710/1000 employees.     This acquisition is not be open to participation by foreign firms at either the prime or subcontract level.  The draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is located at the following USASMDC website: http://www.smdc.army.mil/Contracts/ITAC.html.      NO PAPER COPIES OF THE DRAFT RFP WILL B E PROVIDED NOR IS A MAILING LIST BEING MAINTAINED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS THE DRAFT RFP IS POSTED ON THE ABOVE WEBSITE ADDRESS.     Questions on the draft RFP need t o be submitted by email or fax no later than Monday, 18 September 2006 to Ms. Nicole Meenen, Contracting Officer (nicole.meenen@smdc.army.mil, fax 256-955-4240) and Rhonda Brock (rhonda.brock@smdc.army.mil, fax 256-955-4240) in order to have questions/issu es addressed before the release of the Final Request for Proposal (RFP).

If company is not registered in CCR, they may do so by going to CCR web site at http://www.ccr.gov. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of NetApp equipment.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for Department of State infrastructure connectivity requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.  CA/CST has identified the NetApp FAS3020 and FAS270HA as equipment necessary to the BIMC Phase II project.  The following requirements are fully met by the aforementioned NetApp systems. NetApp FAS3020HA: •	Maximum capacity of 50TB •	Available protocols to include NFS, CIFS, HTTP, FTP, FCP, iSCSI •	RAID type to include Sotware RAID4, RAID DP, Checksum Management •	Interface to include Ethernet, FC •	Hard Drive types to include Fibre Channel, SATA •	Redundancies to include Power Supplies, Fans, Network Ports, Redundant Controller (full redundancy), Disk Access Paths, Cache content protected by means of batteries (NVARM battery, ECC) •	System management to include Console, Web Browser, SNMP, Tivoli, SAN Manager, HP-Openview, DFM, VFM •	Capable of doing “snapshots” of the data •	Capable of both synchronous and asynchronous mirroring         NetApp FAS270HA: •	Maximum capacity of 4TB •	Protocols to include NFS, CIFS, HTTP, FTP, iSCSI •	RAID type to include Software RAID4, RAID DO, Checksum Management •	Interfaces to include Ethernet, FC •	Hard Drives types to include Fibre Channel •	System management to include Console, web browser, SNMP, Tivoli, HP-Openview, DFM, VFM •	Capable of doing “snapshots” of the data •	Capable of both synchronous and asynchronous mirroring As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements as a key component of the Department’s networking system. The NetApp FAS3020HA and NetApp FAS270HA hardware has undergone tests, assessment, and evaluation and received final approval from the Department of State IT Configuration Control Board

(e) Multiple offers. Offerors are encouraged to submit multiple offers presenting alternative terms and conditions or commercial items for satisfying the requirements of this solicitation. Each offer submitted will be evaluated separately.  (f) Late submissions, modifications, revisions, and withdrawals of offers.  (1) Offerors are responsible for submitting offers, and any modifications, revisions, or withdrawals, so as to reach the Government office designated in the solicitation by the time specified in the solicitation. If no time is specified in the solicitation, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that offers or revisions are due.  (2)(i) Any offer, modification, revision, or withdrawal of an offer received at the Government office designated in the solicitation after the exact time specified for receipt of offers is "late" and will not be considered unless it is received before award is made, the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late offer would not unduly delay the acquisition; and-  (A) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the solicitation, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers; or  (B) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government's control prior to the time set for receipt of offers; or  (C) If this solicitation is a request for proposals, it was the only proposal received.  (ii) However, a late modification of an otherwise successful offer, that makes its terms more favorable to the Government, will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.  (3) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the offer wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.  (4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.  (5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers. Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally. If the solicitation authorizes facsimile offers, offers may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers, subject to the conditions specified in the solicitation concerning facsimile offers.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids). The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors. Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions if later determined by the Contracting Officer to be necessary. The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.  (h) Multiple awards. The Government may accept any item or group of items of an offer, unless the offeror qualifies the offer by specific limitations. Unless otherwise provided in the Schedule, offers may not be submitted for quantities less than those specified.

The offeror shall enter, in the block with its name and address on the cover page of its offer, the annotation "DUNS" or "DUNS+4" followed by the DUNS or DUNS+4 number that identifies the offeror's name and address. The DUNS+4 is the DUNS number plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned at the discretion of the offeror to establish additional CCR records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR Subpart 32.11) for the same parent concern. If the offeror does not have a DUNS number, it should contact Dun and Bradstreet directly to obtain one. An offeror within the United States may contact Dun and Bradstreet by calling 1-866-705-5711 or via the internet at http://www.dnb.com. An offeror located outside the United States must contact the local Dun and Bradstreet office for a DUNS number.  (k) Central Contractor Registration. Unless exempted by an addendum to this solicitation, by submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation. If the Offeror does not become registered in the CCR database in the time prescribed by the Contracting Officer, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror.

(3) The overall ranking of all offerors, when any ranking was developed by the agency during source selection.  (4) A summary of the rationale for award;  (5) For acquisitions of commercial items, the make and model of the item to be delivered by the successful offeror.  (6) Reasonable responses to relevant questions posed by the debriefed offeror as to whether source-selection procedures set forth in the solicitation, applicable regulations, and other applicable authorities were followed by the agency. 			 (End of provision)  FAR 52.212-2   	EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each Offeror's submission is evaluated according to the factors shown below.  Factor A will have the highest level of importance, B, and C are roughly equal to each other; factor D is less important.    A)	Compliance with solicitation requirement  B)	Product Availability  C)	Delivery Schedule  D)	Price Contract award shall be made to the responsible Offeror whose offer, in conforming to this RFQ, provides an overall best value to the Government, technical evaluation factors, and cost considered.  The Government's objective is to obtain the highest technical quality considered necessary to achieve the project objectives, with a realistic and reasonable cost.  Technical evaluation factors are more important than cost; however, between offers that are evaluated as technically equal in quality, cost will become a major consideration in selecting the successful Offeror. 	(b) Options.  The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 	(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 under Simplified Acquisition procedures in Subpart 13.5 as supplemental with additional information included in this notice. The solicitation number for this acquisition is RFQ 263-2006-Q-FX-0224 and is being issued as a request quote.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures and is a small-business set-aside. NIH intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Miriam C. Kelty 6709 Slekirk Dr. Bethesda, MD 20817. The requirement consists of updating, reviewing, and maintaining the Bioethics Resources site. Mrs. Kelty originally set up the site as part of the Inter-Institute Bioethics Interest Group activities. The site is replete with resources available to those with an interest in bioethics including education, research involving human participants and animals, medical and health care ethics, and the implications of applied genetics and biotechnology. This website contains a broad collage of annotated web links, and while this list is comprehensive, it is not totally inclusive. The listed resources provide background information and various positions on issues in bioethics.  
In addition, the contractor will be required to provide the following services. 	

	
1.	Shall review and update Bioethics Resources on the web.

2.	Shall review all content for currency and appropriateness.

3.	Shall add material to each category as needed.  This shall include review of recent literature, policy material and training curricula or opportunities.

4.	Shall review main categories on website to determine whether they should be retained.  This shall be done in consultation with OSP staff.

5.	Shall add new main category headings and populate new categories/topics.  These shall reflect adding material about newly emerging ethical issues in science.

6.	Shall maintain and upkeep the site.

7.	Shall review web literature and printed journals to identify new resource material that should be added to Bioethics Resources.

8.	Review all content for currency and appropriateness

9.	Add material to each category as needed.  This includes review of recent literature, policy material and training curricula or opportunities

10.	Review main categories on website to determine whether they should be retained.  This would be done in consultation with OSP staff

11.	Add new main category headings and populate new categories/topics.  These would reflect adding material about newly emerging ethical issues in science.

12.	Review web literature and printed journals to identify new resource material that should be added to Bioethics Resources 

The period of performance is 
For 12 months starting at contract award. This requisition is less than the Simplified threshold.  These services will be performed under a government-wide contract. Mrs. Kelty is the only party known to NIH that can meet the above requirements for the existing system, she has extensive knowledge of and experience in the ethics of research, and specific expertise in research ethics as it relates to NIH activities.  Her knowledge of the resource needs of the NIH scientific community as a whole, her expertise in the ethics of research and her inside knowledge of the NIH coupled with her first-hand experience with developing and maintaining the existing website makes Mrs. Kelty uniquely qualified for this acquisition. A sole source is warranted to maintain the continuity of the environment, avoid service disruptions and provide the best value to the government.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541690. The proposed contract is for services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotes. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. However, all quotes received in this office by 4:00 p.m. EST on the closing date of this announcement will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Quotes shall be sent to: (a) if mailing your capabilities through the U.S. Postal Service use the following address: National Institutes of Health, Office of Logistics and Acquisition Operations, OA, 6011 Executive Blvd., Rm# 529I, Attn: Wendy Rivera, Bethesda, MD 20892.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for brand name commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  NGA intends to solicit and award a firm-fixed price purchase order under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 and 13.

This is a license renewal of an existing capability used to protect national security data.  Mission assurance personnel are required to investigate US Federal Espionage acts; without this current software capability these investigations may be interrupted.  

An interruption to operations due to changes in software or capabilities presents a marked increase to NGA?s risk to our security posture and ability to respond to such incidents.

For evaluation purposes, the government will evaluate the quantities based on the maximum estimates stated above and multiply the monthly total by 12 to arrive at a yearly evaluated price for the base and option years.

Options: The Government shall evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement.  The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced.  Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer(s), mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offers specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.  Price shall be considered slightly more important than Technical Factors.  Of the Technical Factors, Past Performance is somewhat more important than Delivery.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14


NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>This is a combined solicitation for a noncommercial item. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is R1019719 and is issued as a Request for Proposals. The Government plans to award a purcase order for a firm fixed price amount not to exceed $30,000. The Scope of Work follows:

Assessment of the Accuracy of the Troponin Assay in the Diagnosis of Myocardial Infarction and How Gender Influences MI Diagnosis and Treatment

Introduction

We are seeking some clinical data in order to perform an observational study to assess the accuracy of the troponin assay in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) and how gender influences MI diagnosis and treatment. 

Background

a) Accuracy of Troponin Assays

Cardiac troponins are highly sensitive and specific biochemical markers of myocardial cell necrosis and are widely used for the diagnosis of MI.1, 2 Troponin levels rise and fall with MI and with other clinical syndromes associated with infiltrative/inflammatory causes of myocyte death. There are inaccuracies associated with troponin assays as currently used in clinical practice which may result in false-positive and false-negative test results. 

The results of different troponin assays are not generally comparable. The analytical variability among troponin assays is due to the fact that different troponin assays have wide variations in lower detection limits, upper reference limits, diagnostic cut points, assay imprecision (coefficient of variation),3 and specimen matrices (i.e., serum versus plasma samples). The presence of a large number of manufacturers of troponin assays in the United States market makes standardization difficult.

b) Gender Issues

Cardiovascular diseases comprise the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States.4 Gender differences exist among patients with coronary artery disease. The presentation, prognosis, and mortality of the disease are different in men and women. There are disparities in diagnosis and treatment between genders as well. 

Most of the clinical research regarding the diagnosis and management of coronary heart disease is performed in predominantly male populations. The issue of variation in the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of ACS by gender is complex. On the one hand, women presenting with symptoms of ACS tend to have a higher frequency of angiographically normal coronary arteries than men5-10. This may explain why some studies of ACS demonstrate that women tend to have less severe disease and a better prognosis than men11. This in turn may be due to the fact that a greater percentage of women who present with symptoms of cardiac ischemia may have a non-cardiac disease as the basis for those symptoms. 

On the other hand, most ACS trials show women to have higher morbidity and mortality than men although this difference is usually narrowed or eliminated when outcome is controlled for various confounding variables such as age, diabetes, and heart failure12. If women are really at greater risk for worse outcomes associated with ACS than are men, one explanation for this may be that they tend to be treated less aggressively than men even when more aggressive treatment is warranted.   

Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is: 1) to assess the accuracy and positive and negative predictive values of the troponin assay in the diagnosis of MI, and 2) to assess how the diagnosis and treatment of MI vary by gender. The secondary objective of the study is to assess whether the accuracy and predictive values of troponin assays vary by gender.  

Data Source Requirements

We will conduct an observational study to investigate the stated objectives. The data may be collected retrospectively or prospectively.

The study population consists of male and female patients at medical facilities who are evaluated and treated, if indicated, for MI. The source of data may be from a health care facility or a registry. In either case, the data must be in an electronic format for ease of accessibility and data extraction. The data will include the following elements:

•	Demographic data: age, race, and gender
•	Troponin test results
•	Type of troponin assays performed 
•	Other clinical data relevant to the diagnosis of MI
•	Admission and discharge diagnoses
•	Coronary artery disease related treatments
•	Other co-morbidities related to the elevation of troponin in the absence of an MI
 
We will need records on at least 31,000 patients with a diagnosis of MI and at least 2,000 to 16,000 patients who are evaluated for MI and are found not to have had an MI. Only patients who have received a troponin test can be included in this study.
 
Firm Fixed Price – Not to Exceed $30,000

We have received funding from the FDA Office of Women’s Health in the amount of $30,000 which will be solely appropriated for the purchase of the data and the performance of the data analyses. This is the only funding available for this project. 

Evaluation Criteria

1.	An electronic database from a health care facility or a registry
2.	The number of records that include clinical data from a population consisting of male and female patients at medical facilities who are evaluated and treated, if indicated, for MI, and with the required data elements.
3.	Supplying the raw data to the investigators will be considered very favorably. 
4.	However, if the data owner does not release the raw data to FDA, it should provide the statistical analyses based on a detailed plan from the investigators including, but not limited to: 
•	From the above mentioned data, MI status of each patient will be determined. There will be three categories for MI classification based on the MI definitions: definite, probable, and negative. (We will supply the specific diagnostic criteria for each category.)
•	Age-, race-, and gender-specific calculations will be performed for the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of troponin assay in the diagnosis of MI.  
•	The effect of gender for the likelihood of receiving a discharge diagnosis of MI and the likelihood of receiving treatment for MI will be assessed.   
5.	The projected time line for the study is approximately one year. This means that the contractor should demonstrate the capability of either providing the raw data to the FDA within six months of the receipt of funding or completing the final study analyses within eight months of the receipt of funding.

This training software must be compatible with existing USSOCOM foreign language software, in particular, the RapidRote upgrade previously procured under H92239-05-P-0057.

An addendum to this provision is applicable, in which paragr aphs (g) and (h) of FAR 52.212-1 are deleted.  Wherever the words offer, proposal, offerors, or similar terms are used in this solicitation or any provision, they shall be read to mean quote, quotation, quoter, vendor or similar corresponding term to refle ct that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids.

Local clause 52.111-4131 states:  Procedures for commercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis are subject to change without prior notice.  Current acces s information may be obtained by calling 1-877-RAPIDGATE (1-877-727-4342).  (a) Unless the contractor voluntarily participates in the Fast Access Gate Program (see the clause entitled Identification Of Contractor's Employees  Fast Access Gate Program), co mmercial vehicle access to Fort Lewis will be allowed only at the Logistics Center Gate (Exit 123 from I-5) and through the D St. Commercial Vehicle Inspection Point on North Fort. Both gates are open Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.  The se gates will be open for inbound commercial vehicle access and inspection between 0530 hours and 2100 hours.  These gates may be closed on weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) and federal holidays.  On Saturdays, Sundays, federal holidays, and on other days o n which these gates are closed, commercial vehicles must use the Main Gate (Exit 120 from I-5).  Main Gate is open 24 hours per day everyday. A visitor pass must be obtained.  All commercial vehicles will be searched.  The Contractor should anticipate dela ys in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Fort Lewis.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt con crete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority.  On weekends large vehicle s (needing greater than 12'-5 inch clearance) will require a time stamped searched label to gain access to North Fort Lewis.  Searched labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to North Fort Lewis must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5 inch in height and that they will require access to North Fort Lewis.  The driver will receive a briefing on pr oper procedures and a searched label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to North Fort Lewis.  (b) If the contractor participates in the  Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the L ogistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or  the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.  Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (North Fort Lewis), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Str eet Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.  (c) If the Fast Access G ate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.  Local clause 52.111-4132 states:  a.  Each employee who requires access to Fort Lewis to perform work under any contract, at any tier, must obtain either a fast access identification badge or a visitors pass to obtain access to Fort Lewis.  A fast access identi fication badge will only be issued to an employee, at any tier, if the employee requires access to Fort Lewis more than twice per week.  Contractor employees, at any tier, who require access to Fort Lewis twice per week or less often or who do not particip ate in the Fast Access Gate Program shall obtain a visitors pass at the Main (Liberty) Gate or the Logistics Center Gate (or the DuPont Gate when the Logistics Center Gate is closed).  The visitors pass will be issued for a maximum of 30 days at a time.  A fast access identification badge will only be issued to contractor employees if the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program.  The Fast Access Gate Program is a voluntary program.  b.  The contractor shall provide information as required by the Fast Access Gate Program contractor (FAGPC), to enable the FAGPC to conduct a criminal history background check (CHBC) on contractor employees who are to have access to Fort Lewis.  The contractor is responsible for paying the FAGPC any set-up fee a nd the fee per employee for conducting the CHBC and issuing the fast access identification card.  If the CHBC is not adverse, a fast access identification badge will be issued by the FAGPC to the contractor employee.  If the CHBC is adverse, the FAGPC is p rohibited from issuing a fast access identification badge to the contractor employee.  If a fast access identification badge is denied for any reason, the contractor employee may only enter the installation by obtaining a visitors pass; however, if the co ntractor employee does not meet the criteria for being issued a fast access identification badge, the Government may, in its sole discretion, decide not to issue a visitors pass to the contractor employee.  c.  If an employee no longer needs an identifica tion badge for any reason (e.g., quits his/her job or no longer performs work under the contract), the contractor shall return the identification badge to the F AGPC within two (2) calendar days of such change.  If the identification badge cannot be returned within the required time frame for any reason, the contractor shall immediately notify both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer verbally, followed up in wri ting the next work day.  An employees inability to obtain entrance to a Government installation because he/she does not have the required identification badge or visitors pass shall not excuse timely performance of the requirements of this contract.  The  FAGPC or the Government may change the location at which identification badges are issued or returned, with or without advance notice to the contractor.  Any such changes shall not be a basis for adjusting the contract price under any clause of this contr act.  d.  Fast access identification badges shall not be reproduced or copied by the contractor, its subcontractors, or their employees.  If an employees identification badge is lost, stolen, or reproduced, the contractor shall verbally report the loss, t heft, or reproduction to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer on the day such loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered, followed by a written report of the circumstances to both the FAGPC and the Contracting Officer within one (1) calendar day afte r the loss, theft, or reproduction is discovered.  e.  Each contractor employee shall wear the fast access identification badge while performing work under the contract.  The identification badge shall be worn on the upper front of the outer garment unless  precluded by OSHA regulation(s).  The identification badge shall not be used for access to any Government installation except for performance of work under the contract for which it was issued.  f.  The contractor shall, upon expiration or termination of the contract, collect all identification badges and turn them in to the FAGPC. The final invoice will not be considered proper for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act (FAR 52.232-25 or FAR 52.212-4(i)) until all identification badges have been accounted for .  g.  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be notified by the Contracting Officer as to whether the fast access identification cards will remain valid (and, if so, for how long) and which gate(s) may be used fo r access to the installation.  Local clause 52.111-4004 states:  In accordance with the FAR Part Two electronic commerce definition and FAR Subparagraph 4.502 (Electronic Commerce in Contracting Policy), the Contractor shall communicate with the Government  utilizing electronic mail.

The Office of Acquisition Management (A/LM/AQM), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition at the request of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, Office of Mobile Security Deployments (DS/T/MSD).  This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Eagle Brand Tactical Accessories.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Government’s requirements, for compatibility with other equipment in use by the Office of Mobile Security Deployments, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company. DS/T/MSD requires heavy duty, high durability, black and tan tactical nylon equipment pouches, belts and load bearing equipment, compatible with DS/T/MSD tactical body armor systems.  This load bearing equipment is necessary to allow MSD personnel to carry issued weapons, weapons accessories and equipment.  Eagle brand tactical accessories have been determined to be the only brand of tactical accessories meeting the durability, compatibility and color requirements for these tactical accessories.   As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor’s unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department’s requirements. CLARIFIED LINE ITEM DESCRIPTIONS. AMENDED SPEC TO ACCEPT PROPOSALS FOR EQUAL PRODUCTS.  SELLERS PROPOSING 'EQUAL' PRODUCTS OR ALTERNATE MANUFACTURERS TO THOSE LISTED IN THIS PR WILL BE REQUIRED TO PHYSICALLY SUBMIT ONE EACH OF THE ITEMS PROPOSED AS EQUALS FOR VISUAL INSPECTION AND EVALUATION.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate answers to qustions received from potential offerors regarding this solicitation.

QUESTION 1: Is it possible to access a copy of the existing Botswana curriculum to understand how much needs to be done to alter the current content? 
ANSWER 1: The current Botswana curriculum has already been pilot tested and has undergone a set of revisions since the pilot test.  However, they are still Botswana specific and need to be made generic.  Therefore, the curriculum is not available for the public at this time however; it will be given to the winning vendor.

QUESTION 2: In terms of making the materials generic, does CDC want to make them generic for use in all regions of the world? 
ANSWER 2: In regions with high TB and HIV burdens, including Africa, Asia, Latin America, etc.

QUESTION 3: Will the intended target audience remain the same for the generic materials?TB and HIV staff at district level who will train front-line staff to do surveillance?

QUESTION 5:  Is there a dollar amount that this contract cannot exceed?
ANSWER 5:  This is a Simplified Acquisition with a $100,000 threshold. 
  
QUESTION 6: Does "technically acceptable lowest price" mean that the program does not have to accept the lowest bid if there is an appropriately priced, technically better proposal?
ANSWER 6: This means that the award goes to vendor that meets the minimum vendor qualifications and has the lowest bid.   
 
QUESTION 7: I did not see where the proposal should be submitted.  The Brandywine street address?  Is there a particular form that we should use?  A restriction on the number of pages?  How many copies should we submit?
ANSWER 7: The proposal should be preferable emailed to Ronnie Francis at efi8@cdc.gov or faxed to (770) 488-2688. If mailed send to: CDC, 2920 Brandywine Road, MS-K75 Attn: Ronnie Francis, Atlanta GA 30341. Responses must be received in this office by the response date.

<CONTACT>Doug Punzel, Contracting Officer, Phone 617-565-5769, Fax 617-565-5748, Email douglas.punzel@gsa.gov
<DESC>This amendment is issued to post answers to questions concerning solicitation number R1WH17000607, Laser Scanning of the USS San Antonio ship board space and associated vehicles and cargo. *********************************************************
Question #1.   Page 8 specifies linear accuracy of +/- 0.1 ft, area accuracy of +/- 0.01 sq in and volume accuracy of +/- 0.001.  We will be calculating areas and volumes based on linear measurements, and the accuracy of the calculated values cannot be tighter than the accuracy of the starting measured lengths.  Also, the above linear accuracy differs from the +/- 0.025 ft requirement on page 9. Please clarify these requirements.***
Answer #1.  The intent of the linear, area and volume accuracy is based on fundamental formulas. For example a linear measurement of 100 feet +/- .1 feet results in an actual measurement between 99 and 101 feet. The area of a rectangle based on these measurements would be between 9801 and 10201. If the (+/-) .1 standard were to hold on an area measurement the calculation could be off by 1000 square feet which is unacceptable. 
The requirement on page 9 for "(+/-) 0.025 FT" is related to the scans of vehicles, equipment and cargo. These are 3 dimensional scans of the exterior of these objects. This requirement is separate from the accuracy of the volumetric scans of the inside of the ship.**********
Question #2. The basic Load Path Validation requirement from pages 9-10 is for simulation of 5 different vehicles through a total of 19 different paths, i.e. 19 separate simulations.  But this section also states that ?Up to two preliminary outputs and revisions to the path sequences should be expected?.  It?s not clear from this statement how many additional simulations will be required.  Please clarify.*** 
Answer #2. In the best case scenario each simulation will be acceptable on the first try however experience indicates that some rework may be required. The statement "Up to two preliminary outputs and revisions to the path sequences should be expected" is to allow contractors to build in contingencies into the project plan.********** 
Question #3. The vehicles/payloads for which load path validation is required include the HMMWV, M198 howitzer, and QUADCON containers which are not required to be scanned per page 8.  Will dimensional data be provided for these?***
Answer #3. On Page 8 there is a statement that reads:
"Ten (10) 10 USMC vehicles/vehicle combinations (no larger than the MTVR 7.0 ton truck);"  These would include the above mentioned items.**********
Question #4. It is assumed that the three forklifts to be scanned per page 8 are the three specific forklifts identified under Load Path Evaluation on page 9.   Is this correct? ***
Answer #4.  Your understanding is correct.
***************************
All interested offerors can request a copy of the PWS/Solicitation and/or questions from the Contracting Officer Doug Punzel at Douglas.Punzel@gsa.gov (617-565-5769) AND Jim Fahey at James.Fahey@gsa.gov  (617-565-5170).**********    
All proposals (to include completely filled in past performance reports) shall be e-mailed to the Contracting Officer Doug Punzel at Douglas.Punzel@gsa.gov AND Jim Fahey at James.Fahey@gsa.gov   
This amendment to issue answers does NOT extend the proposal due date.  Proposals must be received by e-mail no later than Sep 14, 2006, 3:00 PM EST.
