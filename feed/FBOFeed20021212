<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency intends to award individual contracts to three vendors to obtain a product and support services to enable DISA to identify the off-the-shelf analyst workstation in the marketplace that best meets DISA's Department of Defense (DoD) Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT's) and Regional CERT's (RCERT's) operational needs.  The DoD Computer Emergency Response Team (DOD CERT) and the Regional CERTs (RCERTs) perform correlation and analysis of Information Assurance (IA) sensor data to support IA and computer network defense decision-making.  This enables the CERTs to execute their mission of recognizing intrusions into the Global Information Grid (GIG), and to plan responses, security policy changes, and Information Operations Condition (INFOCON) changes.  Currently, the CERTs rely heavily on humans-in-the-loop to perform this correlation and analysis. DISA plans to identify and test an automated IA sensor data aggregation, correlation, and analysis solution, or analyst workstation, capability that meets CERT requirements.  Based on the outcome of various lab and pilot tests, DISA plans to deploy this capability to the DOD CERT and the RCERTs to enable analysts to more efficiently and accurately analyze and respond to IA sensor data.  DISA invites vendors to:  (1) submit data showing how their product measures up to DISA's analyst workstation Measures of Merit (MOM); (2) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capability to be used in a pilot (an evaluation in operational environment) as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updates; (3) submit a price quote for an analyst workstation capbility to be used in an operational environment as well as for installation support, technical support, and software updated.  The following documents are attached:  (1)  Solicitation DCA100-03-T-4013 includes proposal contents and certs and reps; (2) Statement of Work entitled, Analyst Workstation dated 9 December 2002; (3)  Evaluation Criteria; (4) DISA Analyst Workstation MOMs; (5)  DISA Sensor Grid MOMs.

<CONTACT>Sharon Calmes sharon.calmes@wpafb.af.mil
<DESC>The purpose of this announcement is to inform industry of the ongoing sustainment effort in support of the Requirements Management System (RMS) and to notify potentially interested parties of the Air Force's intent to extend maintenance support from 30 September 2003 through 31 December 2003 by issuing a modification to task order FA8770-00-F-0063, issued to TRW Systems & Information Technology Group, One Federal Systems Park Drive, Fairfax, Virginia 22033-4411, in accordance with GSA Contract GS35F4522G. <br><br> The contractor will maintain and sustain the Secondary Item Requirement System (D200.A) and Central Secondary Item Stratification (D200.N) subsystems; train Government personnel; and transfer documentation, source code and tools required to maintain and modify the RMS D200.A and D200.N subsystems to another contractor in such a manner as to allow the follow-on organization to continue operation without any disruption to the user.  Contractors must possess an overall understanding of the D200.A, D200.N and other D200 systems' processes.  The contractor must be highly qualified in systems analysis, development, and testing and implementation.  They must be thoroughly familiar with D200.A and D200.N system interfaces, algorithms, coding, testing, and implementation requirements. <br><br> During this time period the contractor will support the migration and implementation of Maintenance Block Releases, sustainment of D200A and D200N operational systems in the production region; and transition of maintenance and maintenance support functions to the new RMS Maintenance and Modification contractor.  The Government will submit DRs and C4RDs identified by various users through the D200.A and D200.N FRB to the contractor for resolution and implementation.  The period of performance for this requirement will be from 30 September 2003 through 31 December 2003. <br><br> Potential contractors will establish and implement a configuration management program, process functional descriptions, define the data systems and apply Government-approved redline changes to appropriate sections of the existing documentation suite, resolve Discrepancy Reports (DR) approved and prioritized by the Government's Functional Review Board (FRB), resolve all Command/Control/Communications/Computer Requirements Documents (C4RD) approved by the FRB, generate and implement Database Change Requests (DBCR) to request changes to the RMS database software.  The contractor will also maintain and update all technical documents related to the RMS D200.A and D200.N subsystems. <br><br> The Government plans on awarding a sole source task order modification to TRW Inc. to continue the sustainment efforts described above. <br><br> Potential bidders will be required to pick up immediately from the point reached by the incumbent contractor on 30 September 2003.  There will be no transition period.  The RMS sustainment contract will end 31 December 2003. <br><br> This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  The Government will not pay for either the effort or associated costs to respond or for the information provided.  This synopsis does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP).  Your response should not exceed ten (10) pages, Courier, 12 pitch, with at least one (1) inch margins all around.   <br><br> An Acquisition Ombudsman, Lt Colonel Reginald Adams, MSG/PK, has been appointed the Ombudsman to hear concerns from the contractor during proposal development.  You should only contact the Ombudsman with issues or problems you cannot satisfactorily revolve with the program manager and/or the Contracting Officer.  The Ombudsman role is to hear concerns, issues, and recommendations and communicate these to the appropriate government personnel.  The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality if desired.  You can contact the Ombudsman at (937) 257-4053. <br><br> The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) for this sole source acquisition is 541519.  <br><br> Your feedback is requested by 26 December 2002.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) plans to award a sole source contract to Pioneer UAV, Inc. (PUI), Hunt Valley, MD to develop mobility enhancements for the Pioneer Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV); complete a Pioneer system study which will include an air vehicle detailed design study with improved payload and TCDL; submit an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP), based on the design study, to implement the proposed mobility enhancements and air vehicle designs; deliver two Air Vehicle Engineering Development Units in accordance with the ECP to include the TCDL installation for test; design modifications to the Tactical UAV GCS, integrate Pioneer control software, perform system test and provide logistics support.  Additionally, the contractor will be required to develop a Portable Ground Control Station design for the Pioneer UAV System.  Mobility enhancements consist of modifications to the existing launcher, trailers and manpack receiving stations to improve operational flexibility and reduce weight and volume.   The contractor for this acquisition will be required to have significant interaction with the contractor tasked to develop and test the Tactical Control System software for the Pioneer Ground Control Station.  

Tasks for this acquisition require detailed knowledge of the Pioneer System design and operating characteristics since production drawings are not available.  Accordingly, as the designer, developer and sole manufacturer of the Pioneer UAV, PUI is the only firm with the unique knowledge, experience, technical expertise, and understanding of the Pioneer design and system architecture.  Award to any one other than PUI would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Navy's requirements.  The estimated period of performance for this acquisition is March 2003 to February 2005.   THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  Responses to this notice can be sent via email directly to mcloughlinm@navair.navy.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>VAMC Northport is looking to contract for two (2) full time sleep lab technicians.  VA treats approximately 50 patients per year performing 100 sleep studies per year.  Requirements:  Registered Polysomnographic technologist (RPSGT) with basic skills to perform full night sleep studies and can recognize sleepstages using the standard monitoring done in all sleep labs.  RPSGT's must be certified or in the process of being certified.  Experienced RT's or LPN's are also good candidates with sleep lab experience.  Tours of duty:  Tues thru Friday (4) 10 hr days, Day tech hrs: 7:30am-5:30pm, Night tech: 8:30pm-6:30am.  The night technician arrives at 8:30 PM with the patients, prepares the two patients for the studies.  The full night sleep study patient is in bed by 10 pm and the CPAP study is in bed between 11 pm and midnight.  The technician monitors the full-night sleep study (intervening when necessary to maintain the quality of the recording) while he varies the CPAP study to determine an appropriate level.   The day time technician must be more experienced as the day tech will score the studies, prep the rooms for the night tech, order supplies, and maintains equipment.  If interested in receiving a bid package, please contact Karen Diehl, Acquisition Coordinator, VAMC, Northport, NY (631) 261-4400, ext. 7130, or karen.diehl@med.va.gov.

<RESPDATE>012103
<CONTACT>Contract Specialist, John Miller, (850) 235-5399
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (CSS) is seeking information on Lube Oil Cooling Systems for the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC).  The application is for use on US Navy hovercraft.  This search is not restricted to current approaches or systems used in the maritime environment.  It does include any resilient corrosion resistant Lube Oil Cooler technology, potentially suited for the above application used in diverse maritime as well as land environments. CSS is interested in materials, systems and technologies that can mitigate the physical and environmental effects that degrade Lube Oil Coolers during LCAC operations. The desired system or materials will be capable of having increased corrosion resistance over current systems to levels that will increase mean time between replacement, reduce maintenance evolutions, thereby, increas ing combat readiness and reducing life cycle maintenance costs.  The weight of the systems should be kept to a minimum.   This announcement will serve as a first step for evaluating alternatives and supporting In-Service Engineering Agent  (ISEA) research and development efforts planned for fiscal years 2004-2005.  Systems could be acquired in the future for Test and Evaluation for future LCAC ISEA installation.  Both off-the-shelf and developmental approaches will be considered.   Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics of the Lube Oil Cooler System for use on the Landing Craft Air-Cushion (LCAC) System descriptions should have enough information for the government to make informed decisions.  Information submitted shall be marked with restrictive legends as deemed appropriate by the potential offeror.  Data with  restrictive markings will be handled in accordance with the restrictions thereto.  Interested parties must provide paper submittals with copies on disks in MS Word or Adobe Acrobat format.  Information is to be received by the Government by COB 21 Jan 2003.  The Government will evaluate the submittals for their potential to reduce the cost of LCAC ISEA efforts.  Organizations that submit materials/designs, which are determined by the evaluation team as possessing significant potential for contributing to the solution of the LCAC Maintenance problem, may be provided an opportunity to demonstrate their system.  This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or to ultimately award a contract.  Mailing address for submissions is:  Coastal Systems Station, CSS Code XPS1, ATTN: J. Miller, 6703 West Highway 98, Panama City, FL 3240 7-7001.

<DESC>This is a request for information only.  It is not a request for proposal (RFP) and does not commit the Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this request for information.  All submitted information shall remain with the Government and will not be returned.

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has developed a 16s ribosomal DNA (16s rDNA) sequence database of almost 1000 reference strains and difficult to identify clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.  Although the early application of 16s rDNA sequencing was in taxonomic studies, the value of this approach for identification of bacterial isolates has become apparent.  Partial and complete sequencing of the bacterial gene coding for 16s rDNA is now used for rapid identification of bacterial species (e.g., Escherichia coli).  This technique has been used extensively in research and reference bacteriology laboratories and has proven to be a powerful phylogenetic tool, applicable to all bacteria.  Recent advances in automated sequencing methods have potentially brought 16s rDNA sequencing within reach of clinical laboratories seeking rapid identification of clinical isolates, particularly if these are slow-growing or otherwise difficult to identify using standard microbiological procedures.  

CDC is seeking partners for a potential collaborative research project that would result in making the CDC data widely available for identification of clinical isolates, both in the reference laboratory and clinical diagnostic laboratory settings.  It is expected that initially this will involve making the CDC database searchable, and/or combining with other existing databases, for use by laboratories which can perform 16s rDNA sequencing.  This would be followed by an evaluation to determine the clinical utility of this approach.  The CDC goal is to establish, and have maintained, a comprehensive database of existing and future data, that would be widely available, and effectively utilized for rapid identification of bacteria in clinical laboratories and State and local Public Health Laboratories. 

Interested organizations are encouraged to submit information that would be sufficient to assess the organizations ability to pursue research in the above area.  Standard capability statements and marketing information is not desired.  Submitted information should focus on previous experience and current capabilities in the relevant areas.  Only those organizations with a strong background and experience in developing and maintaining DNA sequence databases should respond.  It is intended that CDC will review the submitted information to assess the possibility of pursuing a collaborative or cooperative research and development agreement. 

Responses should be prepared in MS Word format, not exceeding ten pages in length.  Electronic responses via e-mail can be sent to MMD4@CDC.GOV by 4:00pm eastern time, January 24th, 2003.  Questions regarding this request for information can be directed to Michael Detmer at the above e-mail address or by calling 404 639-0714.

<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is seeking information regarding potential bidders for the re-compete of the Information Technology Product Assurance (ITPA) contract.    The USPTO is requesting this information to 1) determine if small businesses capable of satisfying the Agency's requirements exist, 2) obtain feedback regarding the contract type and possible performance based measurements and incentives, and 3) obtain information that will assist in the formulation of the USPTO acquisition strategy.  THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY; THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION NOTICE.  ANY SOLICITATION WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT A LATER DATE.  NO OFFERS ARE REQUESTED OR WILL BE ACCEPTED AT THIS TIME.   

The current ITPA contract, which was awarded in a full and open competition, expires December 2003.  The current contract is a task order, cost-plus fixed fee contract with an estimated contract value of $34,727,293.00.   The ITPA contractor is required to provide expertise, support, and services in six disciplines:  requirements management/
engineering, quality assurance (to include statistics/measurement expertise), configuration management, independent testing and assessment, records management and data management.  The USPTO is looking for vendors who can provide a full-range or complement of services in these six disciplines.  Vendors should specifically state their capabilities and expertise in the six disciplines, demonstrated use of automated tools or packages used to support these disciplines, and any certifications or other credentials they may possess that relate specifically to these six disciplines (for example, Capability Maturity Model certifications, Quality Assurance Institute certifications, ASQ certificates, etc.).   Vendors should also provide specific examples of contracts that are of a similar scope, size, and complexity as the current ITPA contract and their participation in the contract (prime, subcontractor, consultant, etc.).   Because of the nature of this contract, a strict organizational conflict of interest clause will be incorporated into the contract.  This clause will preclude the selected vendor, its parent, any of its affiliates, subsidiaries, successors in interest, subcontractors, or consultants from participating (in any capacity) in any other USPTO Information Technology contracts for the duration of the ITPA contract.   Therefore, when responding to this RFI, interested vendors should specifically identify any conflicts of interest that currently exist i.e., are they currently doing work with USPTO as either a prime or sub-contractor and if so on what contracts.    The USPTO also requests that vendors provide information as to the contract type (cost plus, fixed price, fixed price labor rate, etc.) and performance measurements and incentives that they feel are most appropriate to this type of contract.

<SUBJECT>A -- LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE MICROMACHINED MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC TECHNOLOGY
<DESC>Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), desires to license LLNL developed Micromachined Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) technology.

LLNL has a portfolio of patents and patent applications for moving electrolytes in microfluidic systems.  The portfolio includes intellectual property for actuators, sensors, mixers, pumps and fluidics.  This technology enables precise movement of electrolytes in microfluidic system without any moving parts.  The devices can be micromachined to fit in any MEMS or nano based microfluidic systems.  The technology is especially useful for a lab-on-chip device because it allows for preprogrammed movements of chemicals precisely to achieve desired reactions.  Because no moving parts are involved, the technology can be used to significantly reduce the size of microfluidic devices, dead volume, and costs, with enhanced quality.  LLNL is taking necessary steps to protect rights in the relevant intellectual property.  

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's MHD technology should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FB00006/03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's MHD technology.

<SUBJECT>69 -- U.S. Army Tank Weapons Gunnery Simulation System/Precision Gunnery System Extension to Contract N61339-92-C-0114
<DESC>PEO STRI anticipates extending the period of performance for the U.S. Army's Tank Weapons Gunnery Simulation System/Precision Gunnery System (TWGSS/PGS) contract Number N61339-92-C-0114 for an additional five years from 1 January 2003 through 31 December 2007. This will be done on a sole source Firm Fixed Price/Time and Material basis to SAAB Training Systems, AB, S-561, Huskvarna, Sweden. The contract was awarded in September 1992 and the last option period will expire on 31 December 2002.  This contract provides the only source of production for the U. S. Army's TWGSS/PGS; all support and upgrade of the USMC TWGSS/PGS; the support and production of 7TH Army Training Command's Deployable Instrumented Training System (DITS), and all foreign military sales of TWGSS/PGS, to include the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  There is no follow-on contract currently in place or to be in place prior to the contract expiration date. Award of a follow-on contract to any other source is likely to result in the Government incurring substantial duplicative costs and unacceptable delays in the support of the TWGSS/ PGS and DITS systems for the USMC, 7Th ATC and foreign military customers, since these supplies and services are only available from Saab Training Systems, AB. The value of the contract extension will be $10 million: $2 million for each of the five years to be awarded.  The point of contact for this action is Jean Borowski, Code 25351, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826-3275, (407) 380-4261 or email jean_borowski@peostri.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>--The U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command's Program Manager, Aviation Rockets and Missiles (PM-ARM) seeks information on technologies that may be considered for future improvements to the Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS).
<DESC>NA The APKWS is a precision weapon that fills the capability gap between the current unguided 2.75 rocket and Hellfire anti-armor missile. APKWS is further defined as an umbrella program that initially includes the guided M151 2.75 inch rocket (Block 1) along  with a family of other precision rockets utilizing existing warheads (M151, M261, M264, M267, M255A1, M229, M257, M274, M278 and WTU-1/B) with and or without a guidance component. The Government has selected General Dynamics Armament and Technical Product s (GDATP) as the systems integrator for APKWS. The information submitted in response to this Request for Information (RFI) will be used to assist both the PM-ARM and GDATP in developing a comprehensive technology roadmap for APKWS block improvements in the  2006 to 2015 time period. The roadmap will serve as a guide for formulating a best value approach to plan future technology integration by balancing cost, performance, schedule and risk. Proprietary information should not be submitted and will not be acce pted.  The following technical areas are of interest:  enhanced system survivability, improved and multi-option warhead solutions, thermo baric warheads, improved maximum and minimum operating range, full CCM capability, multi-mode seekers and smart launchers. Th e focus of this RFI is to identify current industry initiatives in these areas. Information to be supplied should include product literature, pictures, item identification, intended mission or function, approximate unit cost, technical readiness level (TRL ), production status and any other data considered relevant to the purpose of this survey. A technical evaluation panel to assess technical feasibility and potential program application will review information received by the Government. It is desirable that the information be provided in a white paper (6 pages or less) and address the following items as they relate to the technology development areas, as appropriate: Experience and Capabilities (as related to APKWS/2.75 Inch Rocket System) 	Research areas (past & current)  	Development programs (past & current)  	Production programs (past & current)  	Customer experience (past & current work with Army or other DoD)  	Program experience (past and current) 	Workforce experience and capabilities (e.g., in design, analysis,         development, testing, manufacturing)  	Facilities available (e.g., design & analysis, manufacturing, test labs,         development labs)  	List of data available to support technical development efforts (weight,         envelope, performance, maintainability/supportability/reliability, cost,         etc.)  Potential APKWS Program Involvement 	Recommended participation in APKWS program  	Scope of Work and description of efforts required to achieve TRL 6 by         September 2005  This RFI is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for proposal (RFP) or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this  RFI or otherwise pay for the information solicited. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government's use of such information.
