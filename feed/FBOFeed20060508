<DESC>The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), intends to award a sole source contract,  cost plus fixed fee contract to Zeta-Tech Associates, Inc. of Cherry Hill, NJ pursuant to the requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.3 (48 CFR 6.3) NJ, to assist the FRA in monitoring the performance and assessing the benefits of two modified-alignment No. 20 rail turnouts which could allow a 10-mph speed increase through the diverging route.  These turnouts are installed in one of New Jersey Transit's main tracks, and hundreds of trains operate over them each week.  This is a follow-on effort to a previous FRA-funded project performed by Zeta-Tech Associates, Inc.. The work will require that in-service data on turnout wear and performance be collected and analyzed at regular intervals without time gaps.  The Contractor will apply previously developed design and demonstrated methods to monitor turnout component wear, collect and assess ride quality data through a turnout, and assess the potential operating benefits of a 10 mph speed increase through a turnout diverging route. The period of performance shall be two years from the award date, with an optional third year of monitoring.    The project requires measurements of the wear sustained by the subject turnouts at regular intervals. This is a non-competitive acquisition and no solicitation is available.   Interested sources must submit a fully descriptive statement of qualifications by 2:00 pm, Tuesday, April 19, 2006.  Qualification statements and resumes may be sent to the above adress, or via fax to (202)493 6171, or via email to natalie.burgess@fra.dot.gov.

<DESC>DTFH71-05-R-00013

Qualification Statements from all business concerns will be accepted for the George Washington Memorial Parkway Project PLH-GWMP 1A97.

The project consists of the rehabilitation of the George Washington Memorial Parkway (GWMP) from Interstate 395 to the Columbia Island Marina entrance in Arlington County, Virginia and the District of Columbia.  This work will include the replacement of the Humpback Bridge, construction of an acceleration lane, asphalt pavement removal and reconstruction through the project limits, realignment of portions of the Mount Vernon Trail (multi-use), construction of pedestrian underpasses, and other miscellaneous work.

All roadways, trails, and waterways within the project limits must remain open to vehicle, bicycle, boat, and pedestrian traffic during construction. Access must be maintained to the Columbia Island Marina during construction.  Specified horizontal and vertical clearances at the bridge site must be maintained for boat traffic in the vicinity of the Columbia Island Marina throughout construction.  Due to the extremely high volume of traffic using the GWMP and the Mount Vernon Trail and the need for the traffic control to minimize delays and impacts to the traveling public, rush-hour time restrictions and weekend work will be used on this project.

The existing Humpback Bridge carries the GWMP over the Boundary Channel and is a stone-faced, arch shaped concrete structure.  The existing bridge’s width varies from 72 feet to 73 feet, measured from face-to-face of the stone parapets, and has a length of 244 feet.  The bridge accommodates two 14-foot northbound lanes and two 14-foot southbound lanes, separated by a 4-foot median.  The Mount Vernon Trail, which varies from 6’-0” to 6’-6” in width, runs adjacent to the northbound lanes, and a similarly varying width sidewalk is located adjacent to the southbound lanes.

The existing 70-year-old bridge will be removed and replaced with a new structure similar in appearance to the existing structure. The existing architectural features of the Humpback Bridge are of a historic nature and will be incorporated into the new design.  The proposed bridge will carry three northbound lanes, two southbound lanes, and a multi-use trail.  The additional northbound lane is the proposed acceleration lane for the Southbound I-395 to Northbound GWMP ramp.  In addition, the proposed bridge will accommodate open bank-side pedestrian underpasses north and south of the Boundary Channel, to connect the Mount Vernon Trail with the west side of the GWMP and to provide access to the Columbia Island Marina.

The existing asphalt concrete pavement on GWMP will be reconstructed between I-395 and the Columbia Island Marina Entrance and will include changes to the vertical alignment on the bridge approaches.  This will require regrading the Southbound I-395 to Northbound GWMP ramp and the Southbound GWMP to Northbound I-395 ramp to match the new vertical alignment.

Northbound GWMP will be widened to provide an acceleration lane for the Southbound I-395 to Northbound GWMP ramp.  This acceleration lane will extend across the Humpback Bridge.

At the Columbia Island Marina Entrance, the median opening will be closed off to prohibit left turns at the Marina Entrance.  The existing median will be replaced with landscaping.  The pedestrian crosswalk and associated concrete sidewalk north of the entrance will be removed.  Also, the existing Navy-Marine Memorial/Lady Bird Johnson parking area east of the GWMP will be removed and restored to match the surrounding terrain.

The Mount Vernon Trail is a 9-foot wide asphalt-paved multi-use trail that is located along the GWMP.  The proposed Humpback Bridge will be designed to carry the Mount Vernon Trail over Boundary Channel. In addition, the trail will be realigned to provide connections to the Navy-Marine Memorial, Columbia Island Marina, Boundary Channel Drive, and the new pedestrian underpasses at the Humpback Bridge approaches.

The project is expected to fall within the price range of $15,000,000 to $20,000,000.  The project is subject to the availability of funds.

Award will be made to an offeror whose technical submittal and price proposal contain the combination of the technical qualifications and price that is acceptable to the Government.

<DESC>SPECIAL THREAT AWARENESS RECEIVER/TRANSMITTER (START) FLIGHT TEST SUPPORT

The Air Armament Center (AAC), Eglin AFB, FL is contemplating a sole source firm fixed price contract to International Air Response, 22000 South Price Road, Chandler, AZ 85248.  This 16 month contract is to be awarded on or about 1 Sept 2006.
The requirement is for flight test services; to include one C-130 A aircraft and aircrew to support the Air Force Research Lab’s START Development Program.  START is a developmental program to provide operational support, tactical situation awareness, and protection to select AFSOC Special Operations Aircraft. Flight test support is to be focused upon the START development and may include short suspense and time critical mission accomplishment.  The aircraft must be modified to carry the START equipment and support flight testing.  Logistics ferry flights in support of the START program are expected and authorized at the direction of the START Program Manager.  The Contractor shall supply one C-130A aircraft in an airworthy condition.  The term “Airworthy” shall apply as specified in US Code Title 14 Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Regulations (FAR).  The contractor shall inspect the aircraft per FAA Approved Inspection Program (AIP).  All Airworthiness Directives (AD’s) and USAF issued Time Compliance Technical Orders (TCTO’s) affecting airworthiness shall be completed.  The aircraft and maintenance personnel will be made available to the Government as required for aircraft pre-modification preparation and technical measurements such as radar cross section, airflow dynamics, modeling, or other physical data collection as directed by the Program Manager.

The contractor shall provide one (1) Flight crew, FAA licensed, current in the type, make and model of aircraft as specified in US Code Title 14 FAR’s.  The dedicated aircrew should consist of one (1) Captain (Aircraft Commander/Pilot), one (1) First Officer (Co-Pilot), and one (1) Second Officer (Flight Engineer).  The aircrew must be experienced with military electronics system testing and be authorized to operate from and conduct complex highly structured low level flight test operations over the Western Test Ranges at China Lake and Edwards AFB as required.  The Aircraft Commander and First Officer must have prior military systems test pilot experience.  Aircrew members must be able to acquire DOD Secret security clearances. Due to the complexity of the test profiles and specialized experience required, this aircrew should remain with the START program until completion.  The contractor shall provide one (1) dedicated Aircraft Maintenance Technician, FAA licensed and experienced on the C-130 aircraft.  The contractor shall provide maintenance support adequate to return the aircraft to an airworthy condition in a reasonable and timely fashion including using additional maintenance personnel as required.  All aircraft maintenance outside of that required by the START system components shall be the responsibility of the contractor.  The contractor shall continue to inspect as required and maintain the aircraft in an airworthy condition throughout the contract period.  The Contractor should expect to be notified of test flights or ground missions at least 72 hours in advance.  To achieve this availability the contractor shall carry aboard the aircraft a “deployment spares kit” of basic commonly required parts and tools.  The contractor shall be responsible for furnishing the aircraft to a Government designated aircraft modification facility for test article installation. The contractor shall be responsible for ferrying the aircraft to and from the modification facility and the test range. This may, at the Program Manager’s direction, include flights to and from the contractor’s facility or other locations for inspection and/or heavy maintenance requirements.  The ferry flights are the responsibility of the Contractor but will be funded by the Government. The Government will insure ATRSB requirements are met; however, a contractor representative may be required to attend the ATRSB as directed by the Program Manager.  

This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and it is not the Government’s intention to pay for information solicited at this time. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. IAR is the only known company that maintains the equipment and manpower resources to complete the START test program.

Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to the Contracting Officer, Mrs. Stacey Hughes, Stacey.hughes@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-0190, FAX (850) 882-4561. Technical questions should be directed to the Program Manager, Mr. Craig Gleason, craig.gleason@eglin.af.mil, telephone (850) 882-0819.     Numbered Note 22 applies.

Number: LC07- ITS20060054
Posted Date:  May 8, 2006


Description:  

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.

A.  Background:  The Library of Congress consists of approximately 4,200 employees primarily located in three buildings on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC.  The Library of Congress wishes to acquire dark fiber in order to extend the current DWDM network from the Manassas, VA location to the NAVCC facility at Culpeper, VA. The Library of Congress’s National Audio Visual Conservation Center (NAVCC) will support the preservation and digitization of the national copyright collection of films, television, radio, and recorded sound.  The NAVCC is located at 19053 Mt. Pony Road in Culpeper, VA.

Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) is a scalable optical technology that enables multi-gigabit transmission of diverse protocols.  The Library of Congress operates an existing DWDM network between its Madison Building on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, and a facility in Manassas, VA.  Its architecture reliably facilitates the cost effective support of new protocols and services.  

B.  Scope of Work:  The Library of Congress intends to connect two of their sites using a dark fiber service.  The two locations are, NAVCC Location 19053 Mt. Pony Road Culpeper, VA  22701 and Manassas Location 9050 Wellington Road Manassas, VA  20109. Bidders should propose one fiber route between the two sites.  Two strands of fiber are required. The bidder shall provide a dark fiber service with at least two optical fiber strands between the Manassas and Culpeper locations. The bidder shall include planning, permitting, design, and build-out costs to connect between the designated demarcation vaults at Manassas and Culpeper sites. The bidder shall pull building fiber laterals between the designated fiber termination rooms and the demarcation vaults.  The fiber cables shall meet current National Electric Code (NEC) specifications for OSP/ISP fiber. All intermediate connections along the fiber path will be connected by fusion splice.  No mechanical splices will be permitted.  The fiber end point demarcations shall be terminated on UPC / SC type single mode fiber connectors. The bidder shall provide a fiber route that facilitates access to at least one local exchange or central office point of presence in or close to Culpeper or Manassas. The quotation shall include all necessary non-recurring and recurring costs, including but not limited to planning, permitting, engineering design, build-out and lease costs. The fiber provider must specify the general characteristics of the fiber.  Only single-mode fiber will be used.

The preferred fiber type is ITU-T G.655, non-zero dispersion shifted fiber for all links, because this fiber-optic network will carry DWDM traffic.  This type of fiber helps alleviate chromatic dispersion and four wave mixing issues.  
If the preferred fiber type is not available, ITU-T G.652, dispersion un-shifted fiber will be considered.  The fiber cable must meet the applicable standards for installation such as the National Electric Code, federal, state and local regulations, and ITU-T specifications.  In addition, the following criteria must be met, specified in Table 1 (DOWNLOAD ATTACHEMENT)
	
C. Government Furnished Property:  The Library of Congress will furnish conduit paths between the demarcation vault and the designated fiber termination rooms, at both Manassas and Culpeper locations.
	
D. Performance Requirements: The Contractor shall furnish all personnel and include all costs associated with the performance of this contract, including but not limited to, labor, supervision, administration, and other services that may be necessary during the performance of this contract.  
	
E. Delivery Requirements: The Contractor shall meet with the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) within five days after notice of award to review and clarify any areas of the Statement of Work (SOW).  

F. Contractor Performance Standards: Dark fiber services shall comply with the following standards, as applicable: Electronic Industry Alliance/Telecommunications Industry Association (EIA/TIA) EIA/TIA-559, Single Mode Fiber Optic System Transmission Design, Optical Fiber System Test Procedures (OFSTPs) including: OFSTP-2, Effective Transmitter Output Power Coupled into Single Mode Fiber Optic Cable, OFSTP-3, Fiber Optic Terminal Receiver Sensitivity and Maximum Receiver Input OFSTP-7, Measurement of Optical Power Loss of Installed Single-Mode Fiber Cable Plant, OFSTP-14, Measurement of Optical Power Loss of Installed Multi-Mode Fiber Cable Plant, OFSTP-10, Measurement of Dispersion Power Penalty in Single Mode Systems, OFSTP-11, Measurement of Single Reflection Power Penalty for Fiber Optic Terminal Equipment.

Regulations and Permits – The contractor shall be responsible for all permits, easements, and rights of way.  The contractor shall be responsible for complying with local government regulations.
All new versions, amendments, and modifications to the above documents and standards will be made available, as they become applicable. Specific documentation will be required before acceptance of new and existing fiber.  
This includes: Fiber-optic cable specifications: Manufacturer, Type, Size, Pigtail traces, OTDR bi-direction traces to illustrate splice data. This includes Individual splice losses, Bi-directional back reflectance, Bi-directional power loss test results at 1310 and 1550 nm.
In addition, chromatic dispersion tests may be required.  The Library of Congress will have the right to test independently the as-built fiber characteristics prior to acceptance. The fiber provider must detail all plans for fiber monitoring, as well as plans to prevent fiber breaks and failures.  
The plan should cover tracking any planned construction in the area of the bidder’s fiber.  The routes should be registered with a construction service (e.g. Miss Utility) so that the provider is notified any time construction will be done along any of the fiber routes of the provider.  When a third party is engaged in construction along the fiber route, the provider should send a representative to the construction zone, in order to assure that the fiber is not disturbed. The cost of maintenance must be included within the bidder’s quote.  Bidder should include both regular and emergency repair costs. The dark fiber service will meet the specifications detailed in Table 2 (DOWNLOAD ATTACHEMENT)
Response time is the time taken to detect a failure, provide a diagnosis to the Library of Congress, and specify a plan of action for problem resolution. Restoration time is the time taken by the contractor to repair service degradations or cable failures.  Service degradation takes place when the transmission quality falls below the level of the transmission design.  In accordance with GR-253 the maximum allowable time to restore BER to an acceptable level is 10,000 seconds, or 167 minutes.  Government gating time is 30 days, which represents 0.4% of the monitoring time.  Cable failures occur when construction is taking place near where the conduits are buried or when for any reason fiber cables break.

G. Inspection and Acceptance
The dark fiber service will be tested by the Library of Congress in order to verify that it meets the performance specifications.  In addition, the fiber provider will be required to demonstrate that the build meets standards, as required in the RFP, government specifications and those specified by the appropriate local government authorities.  The Library of Congress requires at least twenty business days for fiber testing.  The bidder will be required to provide full, escorted access to the fiber facility during this time.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to award a single-award Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for technical assistance in logistics and commodity security, with the strategic objective to increase the availability of essential health supplies in public and private services.  The Government will issue task orders that are either Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price. This award will be issued through Full and Open Competition to acquire the services of a qualified U.S. organization.

The purpose of this contract is to design, develop, strengthen and, upon request, operate safe, reliable, and sustainable supply systems that provide a range of affordable, quality essential health commodities including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and supplies to clients in USAID country programs. USAID field missions indicate a strong desire for technical support that strengthens all aspects of in-country supply chains, including forecasting, procurement, distribution, management information systems, quality assurance, storage and infrastructure, and medical waste disposal.  While family planning and reproductive health remain a priority in the field and for this contract, field missions are also seeking supply chain systems that are designed to handle a range of health products, including contraceptives and condoms, essential drugs, and select commodities for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, and infectious diseases.  This contract will seek to strengthen supply systems for all essential health commodities and create environments (commitment, policies, resources, etc.) that are conducive to their sustainability.  The contract will also collaborate with regional and global partners to support awareness raising and advocacy for commodity security, and explore new approaches to technical areas that include financing, procurement, market development and information systems.  Furthermore, the contract will provide on-going support to USAID’s Central Contraceptive Procurement (CCP) system, including the maintenance of a management information system (MIS).  The countries serviced presently number 45, with field offices in 21 of these countries.

The contractor may also be asked to purchase large quantities of various types of contraceptives, condoms, and possibly other essential health supplies for USAID’s worldwide programs. These commodities are currently being purchased by USAID but this task may be delegated to this contract.

The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract for the prime contractor is 000.  The authorized geographic code for subcontractors is 935.

Performance under this contract shall be from September 30, 2006 through September 30, 2011. 

The RFP is expected to be issued in early April 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration. The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source requirements contract to ADI Limited, Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Division, Cowper Wharf Road, Garden Island, Australia, for the acquisition of six (6) Advance Acoustic Generators (AAG); six (6) Infrasonic Advanced Acoustic Generators (IAAG); six (6) radio/Sweep track monitors; twelve (12) programming boxes; three (3) hydraulic test benches (p/n IAAG-A9500); three (3) sets of special tools for maintenance and overhaul of the AAG and IAAG; six (6) sets of ship support material; and three (3) spares packages.  The AAG is a water driven turbine powered acoustic generators that produces ship emulation and can be integrated with any sweep system.  The IAAG is the low frequency variant of the Australian Acoustic Generator (AAG).    This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  The AAG and IAAG are unique equipment that is only manufactured by ADI Limited.  No other company manu!  factures this type of equipment. There are no distributors.  The AAG and IAAG are microprocessor controlled, so the sound produced can be varied.  The AAG and IAAG are proprietary to ADI Limited.  NSWC PC has successfully evaluated the AAG an IAAG for use in the US Mine Countermeasures (MCM) Fleet having acquired the equipment under contract N61331-06-C-0030.  Use of alternate equipment will invalidate these tests.  Contracting with another company to design an alternate to the AAG and IAAG would require extensive development funds that ADI has already expended and will not be cost effective for the US Navy.  Additionally, numerous patent issues could require resolution.  In summary, the AAG and IAAG are only available from ADI Limited.  Delivery will be to the Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, 110 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL  32407.   NAICS Code:  334419; SBA Size Standard:  500 employees; FSC Code:  5845.

<DESC>Services include, but are not limited to preparation of design/contract documents for FY08 MCON P-587 Pacific Fleet Sub Drive-In MSF, Beckoning Point, Hawaii.  The proposed project will construct a new 213-meter (700-foot) non-magnetic concrete slip pier at Beckoning Point, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii to support a drive-in solenoid structure, similar to the Magnetic Silencing Facility (MSF) at Kings Bay, Georgia.  The work will include demolition of the existing two-story wooden pier and walkway bridge, and the existing marine rail with winch, shed and compressor; removal of the existing Z loop system; construction of new pile supported pier with overhead trusses at 14.78 meters (48.5 feet) above mean high water; construction of a pedestrian bridge; constructions of sewer connections on pier and sewer piping from pier to holding tank on shore; construction of a 411 square meter (4,425-square foot) Rectifier and Substation Building for the D.C. rectifiers, transformers, and holding vault; construction of air conditioning and ventilation for Rectifier and Substation Building; provision for telephone and local area network services and electrical utilities; installation of cable trays for the X, Y & Z loop cables (installation of cables by separate OPN funding).  Fire protection requirements include installation of fire hose cabinets and fire alarm system along pier and wet pipe fire sprinklers, FM-200 system, and fire alarm system for the rectifier building.  The deperming operation produces high-intensity magnetic fields during the treatment of the submarine which requires structures to be constructed with materials that have a low magnetic permeability property. Local common concrete aggregates were tested and were not acceptable.  Aggregates with low magnetic permeability property may have to be imported from out of state.  Other materials affected include concrete rebars, fenders, mooring, cleats, cable supports and all steel hardware.  Approved materials include Nitronic 33 for rebar, reinforced plastic for fenders, stainless steel or aluminum for all other steel supports or hardware.  Construction dredging will be required to obtain the required depths for the pier and the approach areas.  If asbestos or hazardous materials exist, the Architect-Engineer (A-E) contractor shall identify them and provide for their disposal in the required documents in accordance with applicable rules and regulations pertaining to such hazardous materials.  The selected A-E may be required to participate in a pre-fee meeting within seven days of notification and provide a fee proposal within ten days of the meeting.  Follow-on phases may include post-construction award services; construction surveillance and inspection services; operational and maintenance support information services.  Estimated construction cost of project is between $25,000,000 and $100,000,000.  Estimated date of contract award is July/August 2006.  Estimated design start and completion dates are August 2006 and September 2007, respectively, including review periods.  Proposals may be subject to an advisory audit performed by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.  The following selection evaluation criteria, in order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of A-E firms: (1) Professional qualifications of firms and staff proposed in designing major waterfront pier and wharf projects in seismic areas and corrosive environments similar to Hawaii and Pacific Ocean areas; (2) Specialized recent experience and technical competence of firm or particular staff members in designing major waterfront pier and wharf projects in seismic areas and corrosive environments similar to Hawaii and Pacific Ocean areas; (3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules; (4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time; (5) Knowledge and demonstrated experience in applying sustainability concepts and principles to facilities and infrastructure problems through an integrated design approach; (6) A-Es quality control program experience; (7) Location in the general geographical area of the project and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project; (8) Extent to which firms identify and commit to small business (SB), small disadvantaged business (SDB), women-owned small business (WOSB), historically underutilized business zone small business (HUBZoneSB), historically black college or university and minority institution (HBCU/MI) and veteran-owned small business (VOSB), and service disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB) in performance of this contract, whether as a joint venture, teaming arrangement, or subcontractor.  For this selection criteria, the government will evaluate proposals based on two Sub-factors:  (A) Past performance in Utilization of Small Business Concerns and (B) Participation of Small Business Concerns in this Project; (9) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense shall also be considered, with the object of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.  Include a summary of qualifications in narrative discussion addressing each of the above selection evaluation criteria on the SF 330, Part 1, Section H.  If necessary, continue on plain bond paper. For selection criteria (3) the government will also evaluate each firms past performance and performance rating(s) from the Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) during the evaluation process, which can affect the selection outcome.  For selection criteria (8), the Government will evaluate firms by:  In support of Sub-factor (A), (1) the offeror shall provide historical data on utilization of SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, and SDVOSB over the past three years showing dollar value, percentage of work (of total contract value) subcontracted to large businesses, SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZoneSB, SDVOSB, and HBCU/MI; (2) Information on national awards received within the past five years for outstanding support to SB concerns.  National awards received within the last five years will be considered more favorably than national awards beyond five years; (3) Information showing ratings received on completed projects with regards to the firms implementation of subcontracting plans; (4) Information on any existing, planned or pending mentor-protege agreements under either the DOD or SBA 8(a) Programs; (5) Information on use of Community Rehabilitation Program organizations certified under the Javits Wagner O Day Program by the National Industry for the Severely Handicapped (NISH) or the National Industry for the Blind (NIB); and (6) Final SF 294s on projects completed within the past 3 years, and if subcontracting goals were not met, provide an explanation.  In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contract per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 06 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 75.83% to SB, 15.8% to SDB, 14.23% to WOSB, 1.28% to HUBZone SB and .12% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  Effective January 1, 2005, the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.   Refer to FAR Clauses 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (Oct 2003) and 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (Jan 2005).  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract.  This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility sitting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.  The prime firm and consultants for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.  The submittal/delivery address is Commander, Code NAVFAC PAC AQ11 (A-E Solicitation No. N62742-06-R-0013-A), Attn:  Mailroom (MS2), NAVFAC PACIFIC, 258 Makalapa Drive, Suite 100, Pearl Harbor, HI 96860-3134.  This address is for all deliveries, including US Mail, courier service and/or personal delivery services; no other address is acceptable.  The delivery address is inside a military installation, therefore, strict securities measures are in force; anticipate delays.  Interested firms must allow sufficient time for receipt of submission.  Consultants to the prime A-E firm are required to submit only Part II of the SF 330.  This solicitation requires all interested firms to have an email address.  Notifications will be via email, therefore, email address must be shown on the SF 330, Part 1, Section B8.  Large Business firms who are short-listed will be required to submit a subcontracting plan before negotiations begin for contract award.  Two copies of your SF 330 are required:  One paper copy and one electronic copy on a CD.  Firms responding to this announcement by Wednesday, June 7, 2006 will be considered.  Firms must submit forms by 2:00 p.m. Hawaiian Standard Time (HST).  This is not a request for a proposal.

<DESC>The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is seeking an organization or an institution to perform preclinical studies of potential new therapeutics for the prevention or treatment of type 1 diabetes.  A clinical evaluation is not desired at this time.  

The Contractor will work closely with NIDDK project staff and external scientific consultants in designing protocols appropriate for the individual requirements of these compounds. The Contractor shall prepare draft protocols with the final design to be agreed to by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall conduct studies of potential new therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of type 1 diabetes as agreed to by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall prepare final study reports in consultation with the Project Officer for submission as Investigational New Drug applications (IND) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for support of efficacy and /or mechanism of action of the potential new therapeutic.  

A contract has not been awarded previously for these services.

The Type 1 Diabetes - Rapid Access to Intervention Development (T1D-RAID) program is designed to assist translation from the research bench to the clinic of novel therapeutic interventions for Type 1 diabetes and its complications. These potential interventions can be either synthetic, natural product, or biologic.  
T1D-RAID is not a grant mechanism. Approved requests to T1D-RAID gain access to the drug development contract resources of the National Cancer Institute's Developmental Therapeutics Program (NCI DTP).  The output of the use of these resources is provided to the originating investigator, and may include GMP synthesized material, formulation research, pharmacological methods, or IND-directed toxicology, for support of an investigator-held IND application and clinical trials. T1D-RAID does not sponsor clinical trials; it sponsors the work needed to get ready to do clinical trials.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command at Patuxent River, MD, intends to negotiate and award a Cost Plus Fixed Fee order to qualify a redesigned elastromeric mount for the synchronizing drive shaft for the CH-46E helicopter, under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA), N00019-05-G-0012.

A new mount is required that will improve the reliability and maintainability of the synchronizing shaft and mounts.  The proposed order will be awarded on a sole source basis to the Boeing Company, Boeing Helicopters, Ridley Park, PA.  The authority permitting other than full and open competition is Title 10, U.S. Code, Section 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC>This pre-solicitation synopsis is for a Thousands Blocks Pooling Administration requirement.  This synopsis is prepared in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2.   The Government’s requirement is to contract with a vendor that will serve as an independent designated entity responsible for administering Thousands-Block number pools by assigning, managing, forecasting, reporting and processing data that will allow service providers in rate areas designated for Thousands-Block number pooling to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000.  Thousands-Block number pooling is a resource optimization strategy which enables carriers to receive telephone numbers in blocks of 1,000, rather than 10,000, thereby promoting a more efficient and effective use of numbering resources.  Since its implementation, Thousands-Block number pooling has substantially helped conserve NANP resources, and extended the projected exhaust of the NANP until approximately 2036.  In 2005 alone, the Pooling Administrator processed over 100,000 applications for 1,000 number blocks and assigned close to 56,000 blocks.  Pooling of telephone numbers has saved 25,557 central office codes (exchange numbers) from exhaustion. This requirement is for a follow-on contract of an existing contract which was awarded on 2001 to with NeuStar, Inc. and expires in June 2006.  Services are to cover a one year base period and  four one-year option periods.  The Government anticipates the release of Solicitation No. SOL06000004 within 2 – 4 weeks predicated on a full and open competition basis.   Anticipated award date is September 2006.  The Government anticipates a vendor response time of 30 days after release of the solicitation.  Although it is the Government’s intent to release the solicitation electronically via Government Point of Entry (GPE), potential sources interested in receiving a copy of the solicitation must contact Tony Wimbush, Contract Specialist, FCC/Contracts & Purchasing Center, @ 202-418-0932 or via email @ anthony.wimbush@fcc.gov.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

The levee will be constructed to a design height of 11.5 feet NAVD 88 plus overbuild.  Repair sections will be shifted to the floodside to avoid poor foundation areas and to allow excavation of some of the temporary flood fight materials (sand bags, cables, rock) in order to install the required clay cover. Existing parish-owned land in the immediate vicinity of the project along with contractor furnished clay material would be utilized for all necessary levee embankment material.  Damaged levee slopes will be reconstructed utilizing a 1.3 design factor of safety.  PI R levee design cross sections are currently based on conservative assumptions due to a lack of soil boring data.  Upon receipt of soil boring data for the repair areas, design sections will be appropriately adjusted to reflect actual conditions.  The repai rs include placement of approximately 15,000 cubic yards of sand fill, 250,000 cubic yards of compacted fill, and 235,000 cubic yards of uncompacted fill.  Geotextiles will be utilized to provide stability and additional strength to soil foundations and to  minimize the actual footprint of the levee, thus lessening environmental impacts to the area. This solicitation is issued as a Best Value Unrestricted procurement.   NAICS:  237990, FSC: Y299.  RFP will be issued on or about 23 May 2006.  Estimated re ceipt of proposals will be 23 June 2006.  Actual dates will be shown when the solicitation is issued.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), intends to acquire services and related products to continue the development of a systematic process for the estimation of shrimp fishing effort in the Gulf of Mexico. NOAA intends to establish a system of automated processes to improve the estimation of total shrimp fishing activity in the Gulf of Mexico. The overall goal is to firmly establish the shrimp fishing effort data collection, analysis process, and provide the Government with a self contained fully functional operating system delivered in total to NOAA Fisheries Services at the conclusion of the contract for use in future Fisheries’ operation and management. This is the third part of an ongoing project to develop and establish a permanent shrimp fishing effort data acquisition program to be managed by NOAA Fisheries Service in cooperation with the commercial shrimp industry. The electronic logbook (ELB) methodology and technology used in the two previous contract actions were originally developed as prototypes by LGL Ecological Research Associates, Inc., (LGL), of Bryan, Texas, while a subcontractor to the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Foundation, Inc., (Foundation), under a series of financial assistance awards from NOAA Fisheries Service. The first contract included development, production, and placement of the first 50 ELB units and associated memory modules; development of presentation materials, preparation for and facilitation of port meetings with interested parties; and development of the statement of work and budget for Phase II. The second contract covered the purchasing of 200 ELB unit materials and associated memory modules; production of the remaining 100 ELB units and associated  memory modules; assembly and placement of 100 of those units on vessels identified through scientific random selection processes; purchasing in the last four months of Phase II the raw materials of the last 100 ELB units to be assembled and placed on vessels in the first year of Phase III; collection of data from the first 50 ELB units and from the next 100 ELB units after they are placed; comparison of the ELB data with port agent records for the corresponding vessels, periods, and locations; facilitation of additional port meetings; development and refinement of the data base and algorithms for data comparisons; and reporting and recommendations to the Government, the shrimping community, and other interested parties on the findings of the data collection and analysis processes. The contractor will provide all necessary personnel, material, equipment, supplies, and other direct items of expense necessary to perform the required services.  The period of performance will begin September 30, 2006 through May 31, 2010. Services include, but are not limited to: Assembly of components,  provided as Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) and placement of Electric Logbook (ELB) units on vessels identified through the established scientific random selection process; Production of 200 ELB units and associated memory modules; Downloading and analyzing shrimp fishing effort data from all existing ELB units in operation; Matching trip specific ELB generated data (provided by the Government ) to the previously mentioned trip specific landing data in order to calculate the trip specific shrimp catch per unit effort; Matching the trip specific ELB generated data (provided by the Government) to the previously mentioned trip specific observer data in order to evaluate landings allocations and shrimp catch rates by zone to enhance estimates of red snapper bycatch; Refining and improving the existing analytical software and algorithms to enhance effort estimates in order to provide a self contained fully functional operating system at the end of the contract period; provide quarterly progress reports, annual reports and a final summary. Quarterly progress reports should show progress of (a) efficiency of matches made from trip specific ELB data to both the Gulf of Mexico Shrimp Fishery landings data and the Foundation observer data; (b) the temporal and spatial estimates of shrimp catch per unit effort; (c) the temporal and spatial estimates of shrimp specific effort; (d) the temporal and spatial estimates of red snapper catch per unit effort; (e) the use of Foundation observer data to evaluate #c and #d; (f) documentation of any problems or trouble shooting occurring during ELB placement, algorithms refinement, analytical software upgrades, travel to port meetings, etc.; (g) estimated effort from previous year. The contractor shall also develop operational manuals for estimating shrimp fishing effort from the combined resources of the ELB records and the landings data work with NOAA Fisheries Service program personnel to accomplish a complete successful transfer of the developed effort estimating technology and application software to the Government and implementation of a fully-operational estimating system to be used.

<DESC>**The purpose of this modification is to extend the synopsis of the COCESS project as well as update all interested contractors with an anticipated date for solicitation.  Based on the nature of this contract, several items required intergovernmental attention, which ultimately delayed the acquisition significantly.

Such information has recently been received, and as a result, the solicitation posting date is anticipated for Thursday, 23 March 2006.  The 97 Contracting Squadron plans to expedite the solicitation process by posting for a period of 20 days in order to provide continuous COCESS services for Altus Air Force Base.  All information concerning the site visit shall be provided within the solicitation as well.  We appreciate your patience and cooperation in this matter.**

<DESC>This posting is under solicitation number M-OAA-GH-POP-06-944. 

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) intends to award a single-award Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) for technical assistance in logistics and commodity security, with the strategic objective to increase the availability of essential health supplies in public and private services.  The Government will issue task orders that are either Cost-Plus-Fixed Fee (CPFF) or Firm Fixed Price. This award will be issued through Full and Open Competition to acquire the services of a qualified U.S. organization.

The purpose of this contract is to design, develop, strengthen and, upon request, operate safe, reliable, and sustainable supply systems that provide a range of affordable, quality essential health commodities including pharmaceuticals, diagnostics and supplies to clients in USAID country programs. USAID field missions indicate a strong desire for technical support that strengthens all aspects of in-country supply chains, including forecasting, procurement, distribution, management information systems, quality assurance, storage and infrastructure, and medical waste disposal.  While family planning and reproductive health remain a priority in the field and for this contract, field missions are also seeking supply chain systems that are designed to handle a range of health products, including contraceptives and condoms, essential drugs, and select commodities for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, and infectious diseases.  This contract will seek to strengthen supply systems for all essential health commodities and create environments (commitment, policies, resources, etc.) that are conducive to their sustainability.  The contract will also collaborate with regional and global partners to support awareness raising and advocacy for commodity security, and explore new approaches to technical areas that include financing, procurement, market development and information systems.  Furthermore, the contract will provide on-going support to USAID’s Central Contraceptive Procurement (CCP) system, including the maintenance of a management information system (MIS).  The countries serviced presently number 45, with field offices in 21 of these countries.

The contractor may also be asked to purchase large quantities of various types of contraceptives, condoms, and possibly other essential health supplies for USAID’s worldwide programs. These commodities are currently being purchased by USAID but this task may be delegated to this contract.

The authorized geographic code for procurement of goods and services under this contract for the prime contractor is 000.  The authorized geographic code for subcontractors is 935.

Performance under this contract shall be from September 30, 2006 through September 30, 2011. 

The RFP is expected to be issued in early April 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Services Administration. The publication of this notice or the RFP does not obligate the U.S. Government to make an award.

The Contractor shall prepare draft protocols with the final design to be agreed to by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall conduct studies of potential new therapeutics for the treatment and prevention of type 1 diabetes as agreed to by the Project Officer.  The Contractor shall prepare final study reports in consultation with the Project Officer for submission as Investigational New Drug applications (IND) to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for support of efficacy and /or mechanism of action of the potential new therapeutic.

<DESC>Criminal Alien Requirement 6 - Pre-Solicitation Notice
Modification No. 001

Description: The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has a requirement to house a population of approximately 7000 low security, non-US citizens, primarily Mexican sentenced male inmates in an existing secure correctional institution or institutions procured from state or local governments or private sources.  Faith Based and Community Organizations have an equal right to submit competitive proposals for any resulting contract(s).  The approximately 7000 inmates are presently located in West Texas.  This requirement will be solicited on an unrestricted basis, open to both large and small sized companies.  The BOP will fulfill this requirement through multiple awards and anticipates that each facility or complex of facilities will house approximately 900-3000 inmates.  Offerors are not prohibited from housing non-BOP inmates at the institutions(s).  If the proposed institution(s) houses a mixed population of BOP and non-BOP inmates, offers will be evaluated to determine the soundness and effectiveness in managing and operating the shared institution(s).  Institutions proposed shall meet BOP standards as set forth in the resulting contract.  The facility(ies) proposed must be located in Arizona, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, or Texas.  Expansion or renovation of existing institutions is permitted if completed within 270 calendar days after contract award when a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) as required by the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) exists.  When a FONSI does not exist as required by NEPA, expansion or renovation of existing institutions is permitted up to 20% of the existing square footage proposed and completed within 270 calendar days.  Any such expansion or renovation must not interfere with or delay the arrival of inmates as required by the resulting solicitation/contract.  Offerors shall demonstrate the ability to provide all personnel, equipment, materials, supplies and services necessary for the management and operation of a secure correctional institution.  The BOP intends to award a firm fixed-price type contract with award-fee incentives.  The contract will have a potential term of 10 years consisting of one four-year base period and three two-year option periods.  Contract performance will be governed by a performance-based statement of work based on American Correctional Association/Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions with a contractor management emphasis on quality control.  The offeror awarded the contract must be ready to accept inmates 120 days after contract award at a rate specified in the resulting contract.  The BOP has established a decisional rule criterion requiring all offerors to clearly demonstrate they have verifiable corporate experience operating a secure correctional/detention institution for a continuous three-year period as of the date the Request for Proposals (RFP) is issued.  Past Performance and experience will be significant factors in the evaluation of offers.  Award selection shall be made on a best value basis for the Government.  Information will be requested from offerors regarding past environmental activities and the environmental condition of the proposed site where the institution is located.  Prior to contract award, environmental documentation and other related information will be required in order to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  The BOP anticipates issuing the solicitation on or about 5/12/06 with an estimated response date of 07/12/06.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the BOP.  The solicitation will be available on or after 5/12/06 and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration’s Federal Business Opportunity website http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation amendments, will also be distributed solely through this site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition.  Interested parties requiring further information should email Heather L. Greiner, Contracting Officer, at hgreiner@bop.gov.

The National Marine Fisheries Services (NMFS) requires activities to train observers for groundfish, shellfish (crab and scallop) and marine mammals; conducting annual and intra-annual briefings for experienced groundfish observers; the provision of “Level 2” advanced training for experienced groundfish observers to be deployed in Community Development Quota fisheries and aboard vessels operating under the American Fisheries Act; and materials development for all training and briefing types.  Experienced observer training staff must:  (1) have a complete understanding of the sampling protocols and methods of instruction for each of the observer programs covered by this contract; (2) be capable of preparing trainees to accurately calculate fishing removals, design random sampling frames for the collection of species composition and biological data, record sample data and report these to the NMFS and Alaska Dept. of Fish & Game (ADF&G); (3) be capable of evaluating each trainee on their potential to succeed as an at-sea observer; (4) have expertise in North Pacific species identification for finfish, crab, invertebrates, seabirds and marine mammals; (5) must have a full understanding and knowledge of state and federal fishing regulations for each fishery under which these fisheries are monitored; (6) train observers in field sampling; (7) trainers are required to have current Marine Safety Instructor Training and an STCW "Train the Trainer" Certificate from the Alaska Marine Safety Education Association; (8) provide observers with written exercises and exams; and (9) provide observers with extensive training of North Pacific species identification, including hands-on laboratories with specimens.  The contractor is required to (1) have a large collection of finfish, crab, invertebrate and seabird specimens (specimen collections need to be both formalin-fixed, preserved study specimens and frozen specimens for dissection and exams); (2) classroom space enabling at least two simultaneous training classes holding approx. 25 students each; (3) be able to obtain additional classroom space should more than two classes be held concurrently; (4) have laboratory space and supplies to conduct safe laboratory sessions (laboratory space must be OSHA compliant and allow for the storage of ethanol tanks or jars for preserved specimens); (5) have access to a pool for all in-water safety exercises for observers; and (6) be centrally located in Anchorage, AK, to provide cost-efficient training for these observer programs.  The observer programs are administered in Seattle, WA and Kodiak, Dutch Harbor and Juneau, AK. NMFS-permitted observer provider companies are responsible for paying transportation costs for observers and this cost is passed along to the fishing industry for all but the Alaska Marine Mammal Observer Program.

The period of performance will begin on date of contract award (approx. September 1, 2006) and continue through September 30, 2009. The Government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with the UA, as we believe this is the only source with such unique expertise, qualifications and experience to perform the work.  All interested concerns must submit documentation in writing demonstrating the capability, expertise, qualifications and experience to perform the necessary work to Sharon Kent, NOAA, WASC, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle WA.

<DESC>This solicitation is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at http://www.fbo.gov/and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line (NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil/.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the Internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by NSWC Crane. MARKET SURVEY - SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS:  Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division is looking for companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide COTS, NDI, or near NDI component technologies that can be incorporated into an Trainer System for the 40MM MK47 MOD 0/ALGL.  The Government intends to test, evaluate, qualify, and procure a commercially available Trainer System for the 40MM MK47 MOD 0/ALGL.  The MK47/ALGL Trainer System program will test gunnery training systems and blank 40MM ammunition to meet the ORD product improvement objective requirement for a training system to include blank ammunition and provide home station training to supplement live fire training exercises.  Since a 40MM high velocity blank round of ammunition does not exist in the DOD supply system, the vendor will consider 40MM blank ammunition a part of the trainer system.  The trainer system is anticipated to directly improve the readiness of SOF forces by allowing operators to train o!  n the MK47 system and rehearse missions on a highly realistic trainer.  It is envisioned that the system will provide for a 360-degree training environment.  System flexibility will allow for set up and training in any location using the MK47 weapon system with or without blank ammunition in ground or vehicle mountings.  The trainer system will allow operators to either dry fire the weapon or use 40MM blank cartridges. The trainer will maintain automatic hit/score records allowing for realistic dry fire qualification in advance of actual firing which should reduce the number of operators requiring re-qualification.   Responses to this market survey are due on or before 26 MAY 2006, and must include a projected place of performance, product description with performance parameters and a statement regarding current availability, indication of the technology readiness level or maturity of the technology, summary of prior testing, test reports, summary of logistic and maintenance requirements and an estimated cost for 1/EA Trainer System and 1,536/EA rounds of 40MM Blank ammunition.  Respondents are also requested to provide the estimated number of days for delivery of the Trainer System (1/EA) and 40MM Blank ammunition (1,536/EA).  It should be noted that during the evaluation of all information submitted, the government plans to utilize employees from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) as advisors to the Government evaluators.  Interested parties should submit data of the item to Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division, Attn: Code 0562NH, (John Pfender)/B. 2521, 300 !  Highway 361, Crane IN 47522.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Communication-Electronics - Life Cycle Management Command, Acquisition Center-Washington, on behalf of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command, Communications Electronics Research Development and Engineering Center ( RDECOM CERDEC), Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD), Science and Technology Division, is seeking sources for a multispectral visible to near-infrared (VNIR) to short-wave-infrared (SWIR) airborne sensor.  NVESD is initiating an applied research program for a TRL 5 airborne demonstration of a multispectral, reflection-band (400-2500nm), imaging brassboard sensor.  The sensor will be used for detection of surface and buried landmines from a Class III unmanned airborne vehicle (UAV) flying at an airspeed of 85 knots.  The proposed sensor will be capable of imaging with anywhere from 4 to 6 bands within this spectral region and have a ground resolved distance of 3 inches or less.  Spectral data for each ground sample shall be collected simult aneously.  The sensor should be capable of remaining functional during exposure to temperatures from -51C to 81C without the use of special kits or operational procedures with limited degradation in performance permitted.  Payload shall accept 28V DC from UAV with a + or - 1.2 Volt DC drop.  Power usage should not exceed 200 Watts.  Output of the sensor should be coregistered digital imagery from the focal plane and not be limited to detections.  Designs are allowed to incorporate an upward-looking sky sens or for atmospheric compensation.  There should be a planned transition path to TRL 6 which incorporates a 35 lb sensor payload weight, to include proposed sensor head, all electronics, data acquisition and at least 5 hours of data storage.  The sensor does  not have a requirement for geolocation, but must provide sufficient time tag information to allow geolocation using UAV resources.  NVESD is interested in responses involving any of the following capabilities: (1) FPA development, (2) optics design and de velopment, (3) camera electronics, (4) brassboard sensors and data acquisition.  This is not an algorithm development program.  Minimum Sensor Performance Objectives: (1) at least 4 multispectral bands between 400 nm and 2500 nm, (2) resolving 3 inches on the ground at a platform altitude of 1500', (3) covering 45 m swath cross-track.  When applicable, responses to this announcement should contain at least the following sensor specifications:  (1) Number of bands, (2) Bandwidth range possible per band, (3) Number of pixels per band, (4) Number of pixels cross-track, (5) Number of pixels along-track, (6) IFOV, (7) FOV, (8) Total package weight and weight of individual sensor components, (9) Power usage.  This is NOT a request for proposal.  In the event a sol icitation is developed, it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps.  Contractors who can satisfy the Government's requirements are urged to provide documentation supporting the company's ability to fulfill the requirements described above by 5 PM Eastern Standard  Time, 9 June 2006.  Responses to this announcement should include a technical description and detailed characteristics of the sensor for use on an airborne platform.  Sensor descriptions should have enough information for the Government to make informed d ecisions.  In addition, the documentation should include resumes of the contractor's relevant technical and management personnel, a detailed description of the contractor's experience in development of multispectral airborne imaging sensors, and other evid ence supporting the claim.  The Government will consider all responses submitted on time.  The contractor shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses.  A response shall be no longer than ten (10) pages, excluding resumes.  All re sponses shall be prepared in MS Word and submitted to the CECOM LCMC-Acquisition Center-Washington web page at www.abop.monmouth.army.mil, under market research  folder titled Development of Imaging Multispectral Reflection-Band Brassboard Sensor for Airborne Mine And IED Detection From A Class III UAV, number W909MY-06-R-PM07.

<DESC>The Government has an urgent requirement for work to be performed in the City of East Grand Forks, Minnesota.  It is contemplated that this may be offered as a competitive 8(a) set-aside for small business.  Below is a synopsis of that work. The St. Paul District would like you to review this synopsis of the work to be performed as an 8(a) contractor and let me know how you would accomplish this work in the timeframes established.   If you feel you can perform this work as an 8(a) contractor, we need you to submit your plan of action in regards to the use of your equipment, your employees, and your use of subcontractors, rental equipment, and your ability to perform the work in a time ly manner.  At this time, there are no plans or specification available, so please use only the information below in the submittal of your plan. This is an urgent requirement, so your information requested in this message must be submitted to me no later than Thursday, May 11, 2006.   Please fax your response to me at 651-290-5706 or email it to:  william.j.hurley@mvp02.usace.army.mil Synopsis of Work  East Grand Forks Levee Stabilization East Grand Forks Levee Stabilization, East Grand Forks, Minnesota.    Principle features of work include all plant, labor, materials and supplies required to remove approximately 900 linear feet of levee (approximately 93,000 cy), install approximately 25, 000 vertical wick drains (70 ft depth) below the levee footprint, install a sand drainage layer (7,000 cy -1 ft thick), and then reconstruct the levee to elevation 830.  The levee would then be raised in 2 separate lifts to a final design height of 842. Ra ising the levee above elevation 830 will be done in stages as instrumentation will determine the amount of surcharge that can be placed.  Contract duration is estimated to be approximately 1 year but will ultimately be determined through instrumentation as  to when the final embankment placement can be made.  After final embankment placement, a bituminous recreational trail with a levee crossover (approx 23,300 sy), topsoil, seeding, landscaping and 2 park benches will be installed to complete the project. Schedule: 1 September 2006 - Start Construction 15 November 2006 (Critical  Date cannot be missed) - Complete levee removal (approx. 93,000 cy), vertical wick drain installation (25,000 @ 70 feet or 1,750,000 vertical feet of wick drain), sand drainage layer (approx. 7,000 cy), and levee reconstruction  to elevation 830.00 (93,000 ccy) by 15 November.  This must be accomplished to maintain current flood protection for spring 2007 and allow wick drains to operate over the winter.  Frozen fill cannot be placed in levee. May/June 2007 - Instrumentation installed and read by Government will be used to determine when the levee can be raised above 830.  Anticipate settlement to occur over winter (2 ft possible) due to wick drain action.  Levee raise to about elevation 836 wil l be needed at this time.   Material quantity will be determined by settlement that has occurred.  Contractor will have approximately 1 week to mobilize and short time frame to complete levee raise. September/October 2007  Anticipate instrumentation will indicate final levee raise to 842 can be accomplished.  Levee raise required to be completed in fall 2007.  Recreational trail, landscaping, park benches may be completed in spring 2008 depending on actual date work is ordered.  Final lift may be delayed to Spring 2008 if instrumentation indicates full levee height cannot be reached in 2007. Work is estimated to be between $3,000,000 and $5,000,000.

<SUBJECT>Re-Compete of the DOE ESPC IDIQ Contracts
<DESC>This serves to notify all potential offerors: The DOE intends to the recompete the current indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) energy savings performance contracts (ESPCs) awarded on behalf of the DOE Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP). The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the ESPC authority through September 30, 2016 enabling the DOE to undertake a competitive procurement.  DOE anticipates a synopsis and solicitation to be issued by mid-summer 2006. In accordance with the provisions of 42 U.S.C. Â§ 8287(b)(2)(A)(ii), DOE maintains a list of companies that are evaluated and pre-qualified to provide energy savings services on ESPC contracts.  In order for a company to be eligble for award under DOEâ€™s recompete of the current IDIQ contracts, a company must be on this â€œqualified listâ€ of contractors.  Parties who are interested in submitting offers on the IDIQ recompete should access the FEMP website http://www.eere.energy.gov/femp/financing/superespcs_doeescos.cfm and submit their application for evaluation in accordance with the instructions prior to submitting an offer.  If a Qualified List application is received by the date which proposals are due, that proposal will be evaluated and your proposal may be selected, even though award will not be made until the conditions of being on the Qualified List are met.  If a company has previously been on the Qualified List, a re-qualification must have occurred within the year preceding submission of its offer if it is to be considered eligible for award. The proposed solicitation may include an approach to federal facilities energy needs by providing national, international and renewable energy project opportunities.  Additionally, DOE is interested in the possibility of a partnership between large and small businesses in a mentor/protÃ©gÃ© program. DOE is also interested in small businesses (for a partial set-aside) that may specialize in renewable energies.

<SUBJECT>A -- Asessment of Validites of Selected Analytical Protocols/Prototypes for Dietary Supplemnets and Other Areas of Interest
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a contract to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) on a sole source basis for published AOAC® Official MethodsSM for selected dietary supplements and/or other areas of interest.  This will be a joint FDA/NIH project and will result in a five year IDIQ type contract with task orders.

The development and validation of appropriate methods is crucial to protect and inform stakeholders (the Government, consumers, etc.) as well as to promote trade. Three stages in the validation of analytical methods are (1) establishment of acceptable performance parameters for a potential method within a laboratory; (2) demonstration of acceptable performance for this potential method in additional laboratories (or by other analysts); and (3) confirmation of acceptable performance of the method in an interlaboratory collaborative study.  

According to the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) for Food and Drugs (21 CFR 2.19): "Where the method of analysis is not prescribed in a regulation, it is the policy of the Food and Drug Administration in its enforcement programs to utilize the methods of analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) as published in the latest edition ... of their publication 'Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,' and supplements thereto ... when available and applicable. [emphasis added] In the absence of an AOAC method, the Commissioner will furnish a copy of the particular method, or a reference of the published method, that the Food and Drug Administration uses in its enforcement program. Other methods may be used for quality control, specifications, contracts, surveys, and similar nonregulatory functions, but it is expected that they will be calibrated in terms of the method which the Food and Drug Administration uses in its enforcement program. Use of an AOAC method does not relieve the practioner of the responsibility to demonstrate that he can perform the method properly through the use of positive and negative controls and recovery and reproducibility studies." 

The major objective of this contract is to provide the Government with accurate, reliable, practical, validated and published AOAC® Official MethodsSM for analytes (either present by intention or by contamination) in a wide range of matrices.  A second major objective is to obtain and disseminate scientifically reliable information concerning the validity and ruggedness of analytical methods that can be used to support Government activities, including those related to public health as well as regulatory activities. A third major objective is to foster AOAC’s administrative and technical support of its general validation program. A fourth major objective is to generate, consolidate, and make scientifically validated (ascertainable) information more readily available to additional stakeholders (e.g., consumers, industries, trade associations, academia, and international organizations). A fifth major objective is to adapt (as a model) an evaluation mechanism functionally equivalent to the so-called “NIH expert peer review committee,” to be used by AOAC to more efficiently evaluate pertinent data and documents that are critical to the validation efforts overall. A sixth major objective is to organize and offer appropriate training courses to current / future analysts and associated stakeholders, i.e., to enhance the probability that a given method can be in-house validated to the technical and practical standards necessary to fulfill the criteria established beforehand.  A seventh major objective to ensure that analysts involved in the development and validation of methods under study (via task orders for this contract) are sufficiently qualified.

The proposed contract action is for R&D services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty five days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Respondents will not be notified of the Government’s determination.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses may be submitted via email, courier, or U.S. Postal service to the attention of Ed Arnold at the above stated address.

However, if a company has reason to believe that it can meet or exceed all the needs of TSA for this requirement, it may submit documentation to demonstrate capability.  Responses are due not later than 12:00 Noon, Eastern Time, Monday, May 15, 2006.  Responses received after this date/time are considered untimely and will not be further considered. All inquiries must be submitted in writing to the TSA Contracting Officer, via the e-mail address provided herein, by 4:00 pm Eastern Time, Wednesday, May 10.  The requirements determination related to this proposed procurement is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>A -- Epidemiologic Studies of Adverse Effects of Marketed Drugs
<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration anticipates awarding a sole source contract modification to Contract number HHSF223200510009C with the Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee. Vanderbilt is the incumbent contractor and is the only source capable of meeting the Government's requirements for this contract. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1) implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The basic contract, awarded on a full and open competition basis, was to gain access to data resources that can be used to conduct drug safety analyses to the benefit of the public's health; to respond expeditiously to urgent public safety concerns; to provide a mechanism for collaborative pharmacoepidemiological research designed to test hypotheses, particularly those arising from suspected adverse reactions reported to FDA, and to enable rapid access to U.S. population-based data sources to ensure public safety when necessary. The purpose of this contract modification is to perform the increasing number of drug safety studies needed within the contract’s statement of work. The original completion date for this contract, September 2010, will not change. THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. NO SOLICIATIONS WILL BE ISSUED. All questions regarding this posting must be in writing and can be sent via email to Fred.Ettehadieh@fda.gov. Only email responses will be accepted. Questions must be received by no later than 12:00pm (noon) EST, June 21, 2006. A modification to the contract will be issued on or after June 21, 2006.

This has provided potable water to more than 800,000 beneficiaries.

USDA Forest Service – Remote Sensing Applications Center
MODIS Ground Station and Radome – Statement of Work

1. Overview-
The USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing Applications Center (RSAC) desires to acquire a MODIS direct readout ground station and radome enclosure for the operational acquisition and processing of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data.  The ground station will replace an existing 3.1 meter MODIS ground station (Jackson & Tull Explorer Series Model 2600) located on the roof of a two-story building at 2222 W. 2300 S. in Salt Lake City, Utah 84119.   The current ground station is used to receive direct broadcast image data 24 hours a day, year round from both Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors.  Image data collected by this ground station support a national, operational fire detection and monitoring program for the USDA Forest Service and other critical Forest Service mission objectives.  This ground station will continue to be used for the same purposes.

This contract will include the design, installation, fabrication and site preparation for the ground station and radome.  The contract will be considered complete after all of the proposed equipment is installed and demonstrated operational for 30 continuous calendar days.  This contract will also include documentation and training in the operation and maintenance of the ground station and related software.  

2. Statement of Work-
The MODIS direct readout station must be able to receive, process, store, and distribute real-time MODIS imagery from both Terra and Aqua satellites.  In addition, the direct readout system should be capable of receiving direct broadcast data from other current and future Earth remote sensing satellites (i.e. NPP, NPOESS, etc.) which transmit their data at X-band frequencies (8.0-8.5 GHz).  The radome must also facilitate the reception at X band frequencies (8.0-8.5 GHz) and provide an operating environment that conforms to the specifications of the ground station.

The ground station antenna will be located on the same site and replace the current 3.1 meter MODIS ground station antenna.  Due to existing roof space availability at the current site, an antenna of similar in size with an appropriately sized radome is desired.  The current antenna site does not have a radome and may require structural modifications for the new ground station antenna and radome.

Late October 2006 is the desired time period for preparation of the site, removal of current system, and installation of the ground station and radome.  This will avoid impacting operational fire support provided by the Forest Service during the 2006 fire season.  RSAC is amenable to a site preparation and installation earlier in the season (i.e. July, August or September) if an appropriate delivery and installation schedule can be obtained that minimizes ground station downtime and is agreeable to both RSAC and the contractor. 

3a. Current Ground Station Site Conditions-
•	Ground station is located specifically at 111.949 west longitude; 40.722 north latitude; 1297 meters elevation)
•	Ground station is located on a concrete block structure 15 feet tall located on top of a two-story office building.
•	Ground station location requires the use of a boom crane for heavy lifting jobs. 
•	Three tie points are bolted on top of the concrete structure and secure the current ground station 
•	Roofing of concrete structure is sealed membrane with gravel.

8. Evaluation Criteria for award-
Quotations will be evaluated on the Best Value to the Government.  Award will be made to that offeror whose proposal is technically acceptable, has the demonstrated competence, and qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of this type of professional service.  Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most favorable terms from a price and technical standpoint that the offeror can submit to the Government.  Technical merit and cost (schedule of item pricing) will be considered approximately equal as primary evaluation factors.

The technical/price trade-off will not be based on spread between the technical scores but rather on what, in the judgment of the Contracting Officer, specific advantages have been proposed and the value of the advantages as compared to price differentials between offers.  The degree of importance of cost as a factor could become greater depending upon the quality of the proposals for other factors evaluated.  Where competing quotes are determined to be substantially equal, total cost and other cost factors would become the controlling factors.  It is pointed out, however that should technical competence between offerors be considered approximately the same, cost or price would become paramount.  The critical factor in making any cost/technical trade-offs is not the spread between technical rating, but is rather what it would cost the Government to take advantage of that difference.

This means that award may not necessarily be made to the offeror submitting the lowest proposed price but to an offeror proposing technical advantages that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work.  Thus, the Government reserves the right to make technical/price trade-offs that are in the best interest and to the advantage of the Government.

1.	Technical Approach
a.	Provide information on quality of product, contract time, willingness to work with and provide expertise to meet the needs of the buyer.
b.	Provide detailed schedule showing project stages and milestones, contractor’s proposed progress schedule.

2.	Past Performance
a.	Provide list of 2 direct readout stations successfully completed and supporting information.
b.	Information above will be used in conjunction with feedback from references regarding contractor’s timeliness, technical abilities and actual contract performance.

3.	Experience of Key Personnel
a.	Provide information for evaluating the proposed team the offeror will be using to complete this contract
 
4.	Worksite Safety

<DESC>OPM has delegated the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) authority to conduct personnel security background investigations on ATF applicants, contractors, and other non-ATF personnel, as well as periodic reinvestigations on all current employees.   The purpose of these investigations is to determine suitability for employment and/or eligibility to access National Security Information.  Background investigations are conducted in accordance with established Executive Orders 10450 and 12968, the Privacy Act of 1974, Office of Personnel Management regulations, other relevant regulations from the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and ATF policies and procedures.  ATF will provide these regulations to the Contractor.

ATF has established a contract background investigation program to contract these investigations out to trained and experienced investigators.  Operational and administration aspects of the program are also contracted out to trained and experienced investigators or personnel security professionals, typically, though not exclusively, retired federal investigators who have at least 3 years of current experience in the administration of and/or conduct of personnel security background investigations.  Contractors must possess sufficient investigative and administrative abilities to perform the tasks assigned to them by ATF.

Contractors must be computer literate and efficient in software programs that support email, word processing, and data entry, which are utilized in the administration of the personnel security program.

Contractors’ duties and work hours are dictated by the ATF workload and funding availability.  Contractors are expected to be available to accept work as requested.  Contractors will be paid at the rate of $53.00 per hour.   The hourly rate will be reviewed on an annual basis and may be adjusted as determined by the increase of the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics..  Internal reviews of Contractor performance are conducted on a quarterly basis.  

In compliance with ATF’s specific invoicing procedures, Contractors must submit an invoice for payment detailing the number of hours worked.  Such invoice will be subject to audit by ATF. Contractors must also execute a Contractor Certification that declares that any submission of a Contractor’s invoice represents actual hours performed in accordance with requirements of the Statement of Work. 

ATF may use the services of a third party contractor to provide administrative records and financial management services.  This includes processing invoices and making payments for ATF designated contracts such as those for conducting background investigations.  Consequently contractors are advised that the third party, rather than ATF, may provide actual payment for services rendered and accepted by ATF under any resulting contract.  Contractors are further advised that the third party is required to make payments in the same timely manner as ATF.  


Contractors must be willing to attend periodic conferences at selected locations within the United States.  Conferences are usually limited to one per year.  

Contractors will have access to ATF’s computer network and will sign ATF P 7500.1, ATF Rules of Behavior and Customer Agreement for ATF Workstation Users.  Contractors are required to successfully complete ATF Information System Security Awareness training each year.

Contractors shall submit to the performance of a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  Favorable adjudication of the SSBI must be determined by ATF prior to access to ATF facilities and information.  ATF will conduct an SSBI-Periodic Reinvestigation on contract investigators every five years.

Contractors must execute, and abide by the terms of a Non-Disclosure Agreement.  

Contractors must obtain a Dun and Bradstreet (DUNS) number and have a current registration in the Central Contractor Register (CCR) for payment via electronic funds transfer. 

ATF intends to issue to multiple vendors Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) that will be available for placing calls/orders through September 30, 2010.  There is an initial solicitation with a closing date of May 24, 2006.  All responses will be evaluated and a sufficient number of awards will be made to the most advantageous (most highly rated) contractors.
Because ATF’s needs are dynamic, ATF anticipates a requirement to periodically re-open this solicitation add new contractors to the pool.  

Vendors selected from their responses to this solicitation will be offered a BPA.  A BPA is not a contract.  A BPA is a simplified method of procuring quantities of supplies or services that selected vendors are in a position to furnish and eliminates the need for more complex acquisition methods.  There will be no minimum or maximum guaranteed quantity.  All calls/orders must be acknowledged and accepted by the selected vendor, or the call will be transferred to another vendor.  Calls/orders may be competed among all vendors at the same time, upon the discretion of the ATF representative.  The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 561611 Investigation Services, and is the appropriate designation required by the CCR.

The following clauses are incorporated in full force:  FAR Part 52.212.1 Instructions to Offeror – Commercial Items (Oct. 00)  and FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial (incorporated by reference)  Each Offeror shall include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representation and Certifications-Commercial Items;  A copy of the Offeror Representations and Certifications- can be found on the web at www.arnet.gov/far. The Contractor may request a copy from siadministration@atf.gov.  Offeror shall provide a statement proving they have read and understand the term and Conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.


EVALUATION AND SELECTION CRITERIA.

Capability of the Vendor.

ATF will consider BPAs to vendors, as needed, on a pass/fail basis, based on past performance and experience, and the vendor’s acceptability (the acceptance of ATF terms and conditions including the hourly rate).  All vendors must submit complete responses, must be able to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation and must be willing and able to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor Registration.  These are mandatory requirements and any firm will be eliminated that fails to comply.  Vendors will be initially screened on a pass/fail basis for acceptability.  Vendors rated as “passed” will be awarded points for past performance and experience.  Vendors with an overall score of at least 54 points and that meet the mandatory requirements will be considered for issuance of a BPA and award will be made to those companies receiving the highest scores.  At least 30 points must come from Offeror Demonstrated Experience/Capabilities and 24 must come Vendor Qualifications.

a.  Experience/Capabilities (45 Points):  Experience is the opportunity to learn by doing.  A minimum of three years combined experience as either a personnel security specialist or an investigator conducting personnel security background investigations is recommended.  ATF will evaluate each vendor’s experience on the basis of its breadth, depth, and relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective BPA. Evaluators will consider the years of experience conducting and/or administering personnel security background investigations in the federal environment, as well as computer proficiency.  ATF may assess the vendor’s communication and written skills, and familiarity with directives governing the conduct of background investigations through an interview. (30 points minimum).

b.  Qualifications/Past Performance (40 Points):  Past performance is a measure of the degree to which a vendor satisfied its customers in the past and complied with laws and regulations.  ATF may contact some of the vendor’s customers to ask whether or not they believe (1) that the vendor was capable, efficient, and effective; (2) that the vendor’s performance conformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the vendor was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; and (4) that the vendor was committed to customer satisfaction.  In evaluating past performance, ATF may contact some of the references provided by the vendor and other sources of information, including, but not limited to:  other government agencies, better business bureaus, published media, and electronic databases. (24 points minimum).

Contractors with recent ATF experience will be evaluated on the performance they provided to ATF.  ATF will consider performance that contractors have previously rendered to ATF to be more influential than past performance rendered to another source.

c.  Acceptability.  ATF will determine the acceptability of each vendor offer on a “pass” or “fail” basis.  A vendor’s offer is acceptable when it manifests the vendor’s assent, without exception, to the terms and conditions of the solicitation, including attachments and amendments (if any).  If a vendor takes exception to any of the terms and conditions of the scope of work, ATF will consider its offer to be unacceptable.  Vendors wishing to take exception to the terms and conditions stated are strongly encouraged to contact the Contracting Officer before doing so.

If a copy of the Statement of Work is required in order to respond to this solicitation, please submit a written request via email to siadministration@atf.gov.  Anyone wishing to respond to this solicitation should submit a current resume with his/her social security number and responses to the below requirements. The vendor must also complete a copy of the FAR 52.212-3, and provide a statement proving the vendor has read and fully understands all the terms and conditions set forth in the FAR 52.212-4.  Resumes should highlight the vendor’s experience and capabilities in performing background investigations.  Please provide examples of your qualifications and how those duties relate to the vendor’s past and/or current performance. These examples will be used in evaluating the vendor’s Qualifications and Past Performance.

Only written requests received directly from the requestor are acceptable, i.e., each individual vendor (person) must submit their own proposal. (No phone calls will be accepted).  

Please provide individual responses to the following:

- Ability to obtain a favorably adjudicated Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).
- Willingness to obtain a Dun and Bradstreet number and register with the Central Contractor   
   Registration.
- Recommended minimum three years combined experience as either a personnel security

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL SERVICES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-06-10312, and the solicitation is being issued as a full and open competition Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-07.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541380, which has a size standard of $10.0 million to qualify as a small  business, is applicable.  A firm fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation.  This procurement is for the analysis of blood and dust samples for the Mechanistic Indicators of Childhood Asthma (MICA) Study.  A population-based case-control study of air pollutants and asthma will be initiated in Wayne County, Michigan.  This area has historically high levels of air pollutants. The recruitment goal is 150 asthmatic cases and 50 controls (9-12 year olds).  These individuals will answer detailed questions on medical history, smoking in the home, diet, and residential mobility. Vacuum dust samples will be collected at the 200 residences by the participants and returned to the EPA researchers.  Blood  samples will be obtained at a clinical facility from these children.  Analysis results from the dust and blood samples will be used to assess exposure and sensitivity to selected allergens such as dust mites, cockroach, spores and food allergies. B. Purpose and Objectives.  The objective of this contract is to determine if individuals are sensitive to the following materials using immunology/antibody assays on blood samples under Task 1: 1. IgE anti-Allergen (multi-screen phadiatop); 2. IgE anti-Milk, Egg White, Fish, Wheat, Soybean, Peanut [Fx5e (food screen)]; 3. IgE anti-House Dust Mite (Derm. pteronyssinus); 4. IgE anti-House Dust Mite (Derm. farinae); 5. IgE anti-Cat; 6. IgE anti-Dog;7. IgE anti-German Cockroach; 8. IgE anti-Mouse Urine Protein; 9. IgE anti-Rat Urine Protein;10. IgE anti-Aspergillus;11. IgE anti- Cladosporium; 12. IgE anti-Alternaria; and 13. IgE anti-Penicillium. This will be done in units of kU/l by analyzing 4 ml serum samples provided by the EPA.  In Task 2, the contractor shall determine whether the following materials are present in sufficient quantities in dust samples to exacerbate asthma: 1. House Dust Mite (Derm. pteronyssinus); 2. House Dust Mite (Derm. farinae); 3. Cat (Fel d 1); 4. Dog (Can f 1);5. Cockroach (Bla g 1); 6. Cockroach (Bla g11); 7. Mouse Urine Protein (Mup); 8. Rat Urine Protein (Rup); 9. Mold Spore Colony count (not speciated); and 10. Bacterial Endotoxin.  This will be done by analyzing 3 grams of dust from participants homes, sieved to <150 micron, and reported in units of kU/g.  By looking at similar materials in blood and  dust samples, it will be possible to determine if an individual is sensitive to a potential source of asthma exacerbation and if that material is present in the home. C. Contractor Requirements. The contractor shall analyze the sieved dust samples and blood samples provided by the EPA researchers for the presence and quantity of the materials listed in Section B.  The contractor shall provide the 8 ml plastic tubes and labels used in the dust analysis work.  In cases where sufficient dust samples have been collected, blind duplicate samples may be submitted by the EPA researchers to the contractor for analysis to gauge the reproducibility of the sample analysis process.  The EPA project officer will provide a list of samples according to the sample  identifiers used in the study.  The contractor shall confirm the receipt of samples by returning the enclosed Chain of Custody Form.  The contractor shall provide to the EPA task officer the results of the analyses in a written report (see Deliverables Section, below).  The contractor shall provide the results of all applicable information from the analysis of calibration standards and standard reference materials.  The contractor shall be responsible for the disposal of all materials used in the analysis work.  D.  Government Responsibilities. The government researchers will be responsible for providing the measured, sieved dust samples (fraction of <150 um) in the contractor provided tubes with the contractor provided labels.   Since the samples will only be identified by a code number, the EPA task officer will provide a list of samples according to the sample identifiers to designate the type of sample (dust or blood), the type of analyses to be performed, and allow the contractors to verify the number of samples. E.  Deliverables. The contractor shall provide to the EPA project officer the results of the sample, calibration standards and standard reference materials analyses in both hard copy and electronic format (Excel ver. 5.0 or later, or Lotus 1-2-3 for Windows ver. 5 or later spreadsheets on a 3.5" floppy disc or CD) in a report when all laboratory analysis work and data analysis are complete.  The PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE will be 36 months from date of award. The  following FAR provisions apply to this solicitation: 52-212-1, Instructions to Offerors?Commercial Items; 52.212-2, Evaluation--Commercial Items.  Evaluation criteria to be included in paragraph (a) of provision 52.212-2 are as follows: A. TECHNICAL CRITERIA: 1) Demonstrated ability to measure all of the allergens listed in the statement of work in both blood and house dust samples.  2) Demonstrate Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) certification; 3) Demonstrated ability to measure dust allergen levels for research studies as shown by peer-reviewed journal articles.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   STATEMENT OF WORK Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) Bio-Production Facility (BPF)  Courses of Action Alternatives (COAAs) BACKGROUND:  Immunization is the most cost-effective and efficient means of disease prevention.  Vaccine discovery, development, and licensure rely on a dwindling number of vaccine production facilities.  The Institute of Medicine report, The Childrens Va ccine Initiative (1993), identified vaccine pilot and small-scale production facilities as a major barrier to effective reliance on immunizations for disease control.  Since the increase in U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation of biologics in  the 1970s, the number of U.S. vaccine manufacturers has dwindled to a handful.  Industrial mergers have further reduced the number of small biotech firms engaged in the business of contract scale-up and manufacture of biological products.  Simultaneously,  FDA regulations were modified to allow virtual pharmaceutical companies and distributed, licensed, biologics production.  Lead time for access to regulated facilities for pilot manufacturing, scale-up, and small-to-medium scale production of bacterial and  viral productswhich must be segregatedhas evolved as a significant barrier to evaluation of biologic technologies and schedules of research, development, and fielding.  The WRAIR BPF is an essential, unique Department of Defense (DoD) asset that provide s DoD the capability to demonstrate proof of principle in human trials of concepts for militarily relevant diseases.  No other current or planned DoD facility will meet FDA requirements for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) production.  WRAIR BPF capabili ties must be modernized to remain responsive to DoD and Army biologic research, development, and acquisition (RDA) needs. OBJECTIVE:  The contractor shall develop a COAA for ensuring DoD and Army capabilities for pilot, scale-up, and small-scale production of biologicalbacterial and viralproducts that are fully FDA compliant.  The contract shall develop the COAA in phases t o include the identification of alternatives, analysis of factors, and recommended courses of action. PHASE I:  The contractor shall develop and describe alternatives that consider government versus contract facility ownership, management, and operation.  Alternatives shall include but are not limited to the status quo, external procurement of production r equirements, Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) of facilities/production by private industry, consolidation of services within existing facilities, and consolidation of services with construction of additional facilities.  The recent feasibility study conducted by K ling, Whiting Turner (2005) for a replacement biomanufacturing facility and a previous study by SAIC on the Vaccine Production Facility operations alternatives (1997) should be used as the basis for new facility capabilities and operational evaluations.  T he contractor shall address overall operating scenarios taking into account, for example, the move of the Division of Retrovirology onto the Post, the current operating capacity, and the need to compartmentalize operations for decontamination requirements. Within each of these possible alternatives, the contractor shall address possible operating alternatives appropriate to the operating scenario.  These may include but are not limited to Government Owned/Government Operated (GOGO), Government Owned/Contract or Operated (GOCO), and Contractor Owned/Contractor Operated (COCO).  Alternatives shall include descriptions of operational scenarios as they apply to the WRAIR BPF mission.  The contractor shall review these alternativ es with the government Task Order Contracting Officers Representative (TOCOR) prior to starting Phase II. PHASE II:  The contactor shall develop findings for key factors for each alternative selected by the government that include but not limited to the following: 	Facility and operational requirements, including biosafety requirements and select agent security 	Operational descriptions, including expected life, atypical maintenance, or upgrade (renovation) planning factors 	Quality assurance 	Order of magnitude costs 	Sources of funding (e.g., federal [sources], private, and combination) and the value and price of in-kind procured services performed at the BPF 	RDA program requirementstypes of candidate vaccines 	RDA program scheduleconcurrent and sequential tasks 	FDA regulatory compliance 	Operational indemnification 	Product indemnification 	Ability to accommodate changing priorities The contractor shall review these alternatives with the government TOCOR prior to starting Phase III. PHASE III:  The contractor shall develop assessments for each of the alternatives within respective groupings using the preceding factors based on best business practices, government procurement (e.g., Federal Acquisition Regulation) and construction polic ies, DoD accepted cost estimating, and net present value procedures.  The assessments shall include but are not limited to the following: 	Mission success 	Facility construction issues 	Operational issues 	Net Present Value of costs 	Regulatory issues 	Technical performance issues 	Technology advancement Based on the assessments, the contractor shall develop recommended COAA.  The contractor shall document these recommendations and present them to the government for their use as appropriate. Government-Furnished Information 	Kling  Whiting Turner Biomanufacturing Facility Study, 2005 	USAMRMC, WRAIR) Pilot Bioproduction Facility Economic Analysis, September 3, 1997 DELIVERABLES The following is the list of deliverables and respective due dates: Deliverable	                                		 §	Presentation of Phase I list of alternatives.  DUE: 2 weeks after start of work §	Presentation of Phase II findings.  DUE:  8 weeks after government approval of alternatives §	Presentation of draft COAA.  DUE:  6 weeks after Phase II presentation §	Final COAA Documentation.  DUE:  15 days after receipt of government comments on draft

(1) Would you please tell us how to submit our proposal?

This is a simplified acquisition, and when we set it aside for a SDVO it does have to be a small business SDVO.   No further questions will be accepted.

<DESC>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR DENTAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS REQUIREMENTS; SOLICITATION N62645-06-R-0010 AMENDMENT 01

QUESTION 1 - 10.2 - Unit, Dental Operating - Section 3.e - “The arm shall have full left/right user convertibility to enable configuring the unit on either side of the chair.”
10.2 - Unit, Dental Operating - Section 5.c.ii - “Shall mount to the side of the dental chair through the use of a suitable mounting bracket provided with the system.”
 Can you please clarify if the Navy is asking for:
1) a PMU (Post Mount Unit) that is typically mounted on the right or left hand side and requires a technician to change the unit from a left hand to right hand unit over a period of an hour or two OR
2) an ellipse/radius style unit that allows the user (dentist, hygienist or assistant) to convert the chair in a matter of seconds. 

ANSWER 1 - An ellipse/radius style unit that allows the user (dentist, hygienist or assistant) to convert the chair in a matter of seconds is correct.
 
QUESTION 2 - 10.3 - Chair, Dental Operating - Section 1.T Shall be equipped with a base that permits lateral rotation of the chair top assembly a minimum of 45 degrees in either direction when the chair is in the horizontal position and shall include a positive locking mechanism at any point within the full range of motion.
I am not familiar with any dental chair that rotates 45 degrees in either direction for a total of 90 degrees. The industry standards are no rotation, 15 degrees in either direction (for a total of 30) or 30 degrees in either direction (for a total of 60). Can you please verify that 45 degrees is the correct standard you are requesting?
 
ANSWER 2 - 15 degrees in either direction for a total of 30 degrees meets the requirement.

 QUESTION 3 - Regarding the 1st paragraph and the sentences "Size standard is 500 employees”, and "This is a Full and Open Competition",  would it be correct to expand those sentences to read "Size standard is 500 employees maximum". This is a Full and Open Competition so the size standard does not apply."?

ANSWER 3 - The size standard is 500 Maximum employees for NAICS code 339114, as set forth by the Small Business Administration (SBA). However, Size Standards do not apply in a Full and Open Competition. The Government uses the Size Standards to report contract actions to the Small Business Administration.

QUESTION 4 - Who installs the equipment?

ANSWER 4 - Navy designated personnel will conduct the install. Contractor responsibility is to deliver Dental Delivery System as specified in a delivery order.

The closing deadline for receipt of proposals is 12 MAY 2006 at 1630 (4:30 PM) Local Eastern time. Submit email proposals (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Attn: 21T  acquisitions@nmlc.med.navy.mil. Faxes may be sent to 301-619-1132, Attn: 21T. Email submittal is preferred.

<DESC>Request for Proposal
Wireless Internet System 
Office of Personnel Management
Federal Executive Institute

Purpose and Scope of Project

This is a new competitive procurement that will result in the award of a single firm, fixed-price contract for installing wireless internet service on the campus of the Federal Executive Institute. The Federal Executive Institute, (FEI), is a federal government facility that provides residential training to federal executives. FEI has elements of government, hospitality industry, and educational institutions in its operations. The installation requires establishing wireless service to cover the entire campus which includes three buildings with eighty two guest bedrooms, 12 classrooms, dining and fitness facilities, and offices for a staff of forty government and contract workers.

REQUIREMENTS

Coverage
Wireless service must provide 100% coverage within all three buildings with the exception of the kitchen food prep and basement storage area of the main building and the maintenance area of Pendleton Hall. Coverage must include all bedrooms, classrooms, lounge areas, office areas an outdoor classroom area located between buildings and an outdoor patio area adjacent to the main building. 
FEI currently subscribes to a high speed DSL service connection in each building through Sprint/EarthLink. It is our intention to have wireless access points extended from these services using a central control and monitoring point in each building to provide coverage and access by technical personnel.
FEI will offer only internet service to it’s customers via wireless and will not be connecting this service to its wired network in any way. 

Security
FEI facilities are located on a fourteen acre campus and wishes to take advantage of its   physical isolation and of signal encryption to protect the security of it’s users as much as is practicable. Wireless access point antennae position and power levels must be adjusted to avoid any signal radiating beyond the perimeter of the property if possible. Access points must support the latest encryption standards to include, but not limited to, WEP, WPA2, and WPA.  Configuration of the access points must be approved by FEI.   Access points must be accessible from a centrally located controller within in each building and be accessible individually via wireless connection using manufacturer supplied utility/configuration software for reprogramming encryption keys and running diagnostic programs. 

System Maintenance
The offeror must include comprehensive maintenance support for one year and a maintenance plan option for out years two, three, and four. The minimum requirement for maintenance support must include two hour business day response by phone, 24 hour response 24X7 by phone, and forty eight hour business day onsite response to perform necessary service to the system. Offerors must demonstrate that they are doing business in, and have qualified service technicians under their direct employ whose duty station is within 50 miles of the FEI campus. No exceptions will be considered for this requirement.  The offeror will also provide 4 health checks and site assessments per calendar year, one each quarter.  This will include, but is not limited to, configuration checks, equipment checks and systems security assessments.


Installation
Offeror must provide all access points, wiring, routers, hubs, power supplies, antennae, smart jacks, and any other hardware or software necessary for a complete turnkey installation. All wiring must be hidden in walls or ceilings. Exceptions for short runs in inconspicuous areas may be approved to reduce cost and complexity of installation. All exposed wiring must be pre approved by the FEI technical representative to meet the requirements of this procurement.

WIRELESS QUESTIONS FROM VENDORS

Q. Are your switches PoE (Powe over Ethernet)?
A. Offeror must provide all switches as specified in solicitation.

Q. Can we drill hole if there is a need to extend cables?
A. Some drilling is normal for a project of this size. All exposed wiring must be pre-approved by an FEI representative.

Q In the main building do the LAN wires to be relocated require a new cabinet or housing?
A. Yes. All bedroom LAN wiring to be moved to the new DSL service need to be moved to a vendor provided equipment enclosure. There should be room for vendor supplied equipment in existing equipment enclosures in the other buildings.

Q. Do any of the buildings have risers or cable chases to route cabling?
A. No. 

Q. How old are the buildings where installation is required. Do you have any details about type of construction, i.e. plaster, sheet rock, etc…..?
A. The main building is about 50 years old, plaster walls, with an addition that is about                      15 years old, sheet rock, and wooden studs.
 Pendelton Hall is about 50 years old, plaster walls
 Gwin Hall is 7 years old, sheet rock.

Q. What are the classroom sizes?
A. Classroom size varies from large rooms approx 30X50 to small breakout rooms approx 14X20

Q. Will existing DSL service to wired workstation be integrated into the new system?
A. Yes. All existing work stations must be integrated with wired connections to the completed system. Their connections may not be disconnected during the installation except for brief periods of time during cutover.

Q. Describe the outdoor areas to be covered.
A. Two areas require coverage. The patio area adjacent to the main building now being served by a wireless hotspot and the outdoor classroom located in the area behind the main building. Coverage is not required at other outdoor areas.

Q. Can existing APs (Access Points) that serve two hot spots be used in the new system.
A. They can be used only if they can be controlled by the system controller for offeror installed APs.

Q. Must the maintenance/service required by the offeror include field replacement of failed components? Is a long term maintenance offering required and will it be scored in the technical evaluations?
A. Yes. Maintenance and service is required and are essential   Offerors must demonstrate that they have a bona fide service department with experienced personnel operating close to the Federal Executive Institute facility. They must demonstrate a history of providing long term scheduled maintenance, emergency service, and staff training. The solicitation has specific language addressing this requirement. Technical scoring will include consideration for this requirement for up to five years.

Q How many total users will be connecting to the network?
A. The total number of users at a given time is unknown. Total population of possible users at the facility will often exceed 100 persons.

Q. What is the speed of the existing services?
A. 1.5/384

Q. Will power backup be required?
A. A UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) will be required for each controller. It will need to provide power to the APs (Access Points) and controller for approx 30 minutes.

Q. Does Federal Executive Institute plan to use this network for applications other than wireless internet?
A. It is not likely that FEI will use this system for VOIP (Voice Over IP) at any time in the next three years. FEI may explore the possibility of accessing data from a web server or other servers and printing using the wireless system.

Q. Will the offeror be responsible to provide wiring to bedrooms or can existing wiring be used?
A. Existing wiring should be used. All bedrooms OPM (office of Personnel Management) LAN connections and a few selected public area connections must be switched to the new service provided by the offeror.

Q. Is there any equipment in the bedrooms that may interfere with the wireless system?
A. There is no known equipment that would interfere with the wireless system. Resolving interference problems in any area of the facility is the responsibility of the offeror.

Q. Is electrical power available in the outdoor classroom area? Can the offeror use it to power an AP (Access Point)?
A. There is electrical power in the outdoor classroom area. It can only be used if the offeror is able to hide all signal and power cabling to effect an attractive installation in this area. FEI must pre-approve any plan to use the existing power outlet before installation.

Q Is the offeror responsible for additional electrical circuits required for installation?
A. The offeror is responsible for any and all additional signal and power cabling required to complete the installation.

Q. Will a long-standing service relationship/partnership with a sub-contractor be considered to fulfill the requirement or must the installation technicians be directly employed by the bidder?  Is it the same requirement for the follow-on maintenance?
A. The solicitation clearly states that offerors have servicing technicians under their direct employ. Subcontractors are not direct employees. This is critical for ongoing maintenance and service support and helpful for the installation team.

Q. We have come up with several questions regarding cabling between the facilities? Does cabling already exist at Federal Executive Institute that is separate from the current Internet network? If cabling does not exist, can cabling be installed between the buildings for this RFP (Request for Proposal)?
A. There is no existing available cabling between buildings. Installing buried cabling between buildings is permitted. Aerial cabling between buildings is not acceptable. There are no available conduits connected between buildings
