Additionally, this BAA and all amendments and information related to this announcement will be posted electronically on the INTERNET at: http://www.mountainhome.af.mil/battlelab/index.asp and to the Federal Business Opportunities at http://www.eps.gov

C.         OBJECTIVE

(1) Technical Description: 

The mission of the Air Warfare Battlelab is to rapidly identify and prove the worth of innovative ideas for enhancing the deployability, sustainability, survivability, and lethality of contingency Air Expeditionary Forces for Global Engagement.     

It is focused in two areas: combat air forces and agile combat support.  Areas of concern include but are not limited to:  aircraft maintenance, ground support equipment, civil engineering projects, medical, intelligence gathering/distribution, bombs on target, munitions, air-to-ground operations, personnel recovery, communications, and supply.   

Proposed equipment should be simple in design and minimize the need for special tools.  Equipment configurations should avoid/minimize the need for any special support equipment beyond off-the-shelf assets.  All special equipment/tools required for assembly will be organic to the systems/components.  Equipment systems must be air transportable.

The equipment/system must be robust enough for diverse and harsh environments worldwide and operable in all climatic conditions.  Integrated systems will provide the capability to support operations for an extended period.  It should also be able to withstand numerous and extended storage/deployment/use cycles.

This BAA requests concept papers to identify material and non-materiel solutions to make our combat expeditionary forces lighter, leaner and more lethal.     

Concepts should directly benefit deployed expeditionary forces, although the entire cradle-to-grave continuum of warfare should be considered.   

AWB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment, but does have limited funding for demonstrations.  Ultimately, the AWB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative concepts, evaluates their military worth and presents its assessments to senior decision makers.

The proposed concept will be based on the demonstration of COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE  TECHNOLOGY.

All responses to this BAA will be evaluated for applicability to the aforementioned need.         

Should an offeror submit a concept that is better aligned with the needs of another Battlelab or requiring activity, the Air Warfare Battlelab will send written notice of this fact with reference to the appropriate activity. 

D.         ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Potential offerors are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference number BAA AWB 07-0001 with their submissions. Potential offerors are required to register their company information at www.ccr.gov before any contracts can be awarded to that company.     Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Minority Institutions (MIs) are encouraged to apply.     Notice to Foreign Owned Firms: Such firms are asked to immediately notify the Air Force point of contact, Mr. Raymond Prazak at (208) 828-3106 or email to: ray.prazak@mountainhome.af.mil upon deciding to respond to this announcement.

E.         CONCEPT PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS 

The cost of preparing concept papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost IAW FAR 31.205-18.     Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the concept paper and any evaluations.     The submitter must mark the concept paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 3.104-5.     Unnecessarily elaborate brochures or proposals are not desired.     Offerors are strongly encouraged to submit concept papers, not to exceed five (5) pages, to the electronic addresses listed in section A of this announcement.     However, if you do not have the capability of transmitting the concept paper electronically, submit three (3) copies, not to exceed 5 pages, of the proposed concept to Mr. Prazak at the address in Section A of this BAA.     The concept paper shall be formatted as follows: 

Section A: Title, Submitter, Date, E-Mail Account, Phone#, Fax #, Organization/Office Symbol, Address; Period of Performance, Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) cost of effort. 

Section B: Problem Statement, Need Statement or Operational Impact statement which concisely summarizes how the product of the demonstration will enhance Air Force AEF and/or CAF operations.

Multiple concept papers addressing different research areas may be submitted by each offeror; however, each concept paper should address only one concept.     Those concept papers found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA and of interest to the Government may be invited to submit a complete technical and price proposal.     AN INVITATION BASED UPON A SUBMITTED CONCEPT PAPER DOES NOT ASSURE THAT THE OFFEROR WILL BE AWARDED A SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT. 

F.         BASIS FOR AWARD

(1) Concept papers will be evaluated as they are received based on acceptability or non-acceptability without regard to other concepts submitted under this announcement.     Concept papers will be evaluated under the following criteria listed in descending order of importance: 

(a) The extent to which the proposed concept makes the Air Force lighter, leaner or more lethal, 

(b) Impact of the proposed concept on one or more of the six Air Force Distinctive Capabilities (Air and Space Superiority, Global Attack, Rapid Global Mobility, Precision Engagement, Information Superiority, Agile Combat Support), 

(c) Technical merit of the proposed concept with an emphasis on novel, creative, and innovative solutions, and 

(d) Proposed cost.     

All four areas, (a) through (d), will be evaluated at the same time during the evaluation process.     No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting the concept papers.

(2) Anticipated Period of Performance: Average duration of demonstrations will be up to 15 months from time of award through complete evaluation and demonstration of the operational concept.     However, some initiatives may require more resources depending on complexity of the concept.     Type of contract(s) expected: Firm-Fixed Price (Unless another contract type is determined by the contracting officer to be more appropriate).     Primary appropriation type: Operations and Maintenance

<SUBJECT>99--Down Blend of Highly Enriched Uranium and Establishment of Reliable Fuel Supply
<SOLNBR>DE-AC55-07NA25729
<ARCHDATE>05082007
<CONTACT>Carol Elliott, Contracting Officer, 865-574-3233, elliottcr@yso.doe.gov;Carol Elliott, Contract Specialist, 865-574-3233, elliottcr@y12.doe.gov
<DESC>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) plans to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to procure commercial down-blending services to down-blend 17.4 metric tons (MT) of highly enriched uranium (HEU) to low enriched uranium (LEU), and to store the LEU for use in the Reliable Fuel Supply (RFS) program. Based on the best currently available information, the HEU to be down-blended will have the characteristics described in the attached document. NNSA plans to issue the RFP late December 2006 or early January 2007 and execute a contract approximately April/May of 2007.  NNSA anticipates it will begin shipments of HEU within two months of award.  Shipments of HEU would be completed in approximately three years, with down-blending completed in approximately four years.  NNSAâ€™s Office of Fissile Materials Disposition will oversee the down-blending of the material. Consistent with Secretary Bodmanâ€™s remarks delivered to the IAEA General Conference on September 26, 2005, a substantial majority of the resulting LEU will be used to implement the RFS program, which is intended to ensure reliable access to nuclear fuel feedstock for power reactors in foreign countries that voluntarily choose not to pursue  uranium enrichment and reprocessing technologies.  This material will provide a significant reserve that will increase the confidence of countries voluntarily choosing not to pursue enrichment and reprocessing that they will not risk losing the benefits of nuclear power. The scope of work will require the contractor to down-blend approximately 17.4 MT of HEU to a 4.95 % uranium-235 assay.  NNSA will transport the HEU to the designated facility.  The contractor will be required to provide all equipment, materials, and services associated with down-blending the HEU to LEU, including providing uranium for blend stock.  The contractor will also be responsible for transporting the LEU to a fuel fabricator(s) facility, or other licensed facility for storage and conversion of the LEU to uranium hexafluoride (UF6). As compensation for the down-blending, transportation and conversion to UF6, the contractor shall retain a fixed portion of the down-blended LEU for its own use or sale. The contractor will be required to demonstrate it meets or has the capability to meet the following requirements prior to beginning shipments: (1) hold Nuclear Regulatory Commission license(s) for the receipt, storage, processing and shipping of HEU and/or LEU, as appropriate; (2) receive shipments in accordance with the DOE Secure Transportation System requirements; and (3) possess other necessary federal, state, and local permits relevant to the proposed activities. Bidders that satisfy these requirements will be evaluated on the basis of: (1) their technical capabilities to accept HEU and to process the HEU in the time frames required; (2) making their relevant facilities eligible for an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) verification regime on the down-blending process; (3) providing LEU on NNSAâ€™s schedule in the form of UF6; (4) Offerorâ€™s past performance and relevant experience; and (5) Offerorâ€™s business capabilities. The contract for down-blending services is anticipated to have a period of performance of five years and to cover all services through delivery to the storage facility and conversion to UF6.  A property loan agreement will be executed to cover the storage of the LEU and its availability under the RFS. As compensation for the storage of the LEU, much of the material can be used by the contractor as working inventory.  40 metric tons of UF6, in the form of 4.95% assay UF6 must be retained and available for recall with 30 days notice from the Department.  NNSA will retain the right to recall any or all of the stored LEU with 180 days notice.  All LEU delivered to the Department will be in the form of UF6. A pre-proposal conference is anticipated to be held approximately one week after release of the RFP. Because of the multi-faceted nature of this contract, it is expected that teaming arrangements may be necessary to meet all elements of the contract. All inquiries related to this procurement should be referred to the Contracting Officer, Carol R. Elliott.

<DESC>This is a synopsis for services to be procurred under FAR part 13.  The 45th Contracting Squadron intends to award a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) purchase order on a sole source basis with Zel Technologies, L.L.C., Hampton VA.  The primary objective of this effort provide scientific and professional program management services needed to assist in the continued development of a rapid, organized, nuclear forensics-based nuclear event attribution capability, development of related nuclear analysis techniques, analytical tools, systems and contingency plans.  This requirement is considered noncommercial in nature.  The period of performance will be approximately four months from 1 Feb 07.  The Contracting Officer has determined that only one source is reasonably available to fulfill this requirement under the authority at FAR 13.106-1(b).  The time required to learn and become proficient in contract and program requirements would lead to the need for a phase in period or overlapping periods of performance that would lead to a substantial dupliction of costs that would not be waranted given the short duration of the purchase order.  It is anticipated that these services will be procurred competitively in the future.  Market Research has begun for the follow-on requirement and was previously listed on the FedBizOps website under reference number Domino1.  No solicitation documents exist at this time.  This acquisition will be conducted on an unrestricted basis. This North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541710.  Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received prior to the closing date of this notice.    Point of contact is James Loeffler, 45 CONS/LGCCB, 1030 South Highway A1A Bldg. 989 MS 1000, Patrick AFB FL 32925-3002.  The clause at Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation (AFFARS) 5352.201-9101, Ombudsman, is applicable to this request.  In accordance with AFFARS 5301.9103, the first sentence of clause 5352.201-9101 paragraph (c) is tailored to read:  "If resolution cannot be made by the Contracting Officer, concerned parties may contact the Air Force Space Command ombudsmen, HQ AFSPC/A7K, 150 Vandenberg St., Ste 1105, Peterson AFB, CO 80914-4350, 719-554-5250, FAX 719-554-5299, a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil]".

<DESC>This is a synopsis of a proposed contract action in accordance with FAR Subpart 5.2.  This Research and Develop (R&D) requirement is to study the Condition Based Maintenance (CBM+) process, provide an implementation roadmap for a CBM+ program meeting full DoD and Air Force policy requirements and to develop prototype maintenance data collection and flight data collection systems for United States Air Force (USAF) C-130 aircraft.   

The estimated issue date for the solicitation to www.FedBizOpps.gov will be 16 August 2006 with an estimated response date by 30 September 2006 (or 45 days after actual RFP post date).  The estimated award date is 17 October 2006.  Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. 

A sole source award is contemplated to The Corporation of Mercer University, Mercer Engineering Research Center (MERC), 135 Osigian Blvd., Warner Robins, GA 31088-7810 (CAGE 0AC45).  The applicable authority and justification is 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (the supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).  Per FAR 6.302.1(a)(ii), services may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and there would be unacceptable delays in fulfilling agency’s requirements if other than sole source contracting methods were used.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  All potential offerors should contact the Contracting Officer  identified below for additional information or to communicate concerns, if any, concerning this acquisition.  

The proposed action is for a five-year Indefinite Delivery – Indefinite Quantity contract.  The basic period of performance will be for one-year and there will be four one-year options.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for four (4) qualification units and twenty-four (24) flight-unit Restraint and Release Mechanisms in support of the Deployment Subsystems of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Project. NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to NEA Electronics.  NEA Electronics shall deliver four (4) qualification units and twenty-four (24) flight-unit Restraint and Release Mechanisms in support of the Deployment Subsystems of the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) Project.  NEA Electronics is uniquely qualified for this requirement because of their ability to deliver this product in sixteen (16) weeks after contract award.  Based on the knowledge of the current market, NEA Electronics is the only available source that can deliver with the current urgency.  The partially reusable, split-spool type Restraint and Release Mechanism that will work in conjunction with a Restraint and Release System needed by the Government is not yet specifically available and can only be provided by one responsible source.  Other Restraint and Release Mechanism types will not meet the Government’s needs without compromising the reliability of the Deployment Subsystem of LRO.  NEA possesses the combined qualifications to deliver the required Restraint and Release Mechanisms as: NEA has an existing, similar product that lends itself to simple modification to satisfy the needs of the Government; NEA has successfully demonstrated the product’s performance under operational conditions similar to those of LRO; through the successful performance of the product, NEA has demonstrated that it possesses the engineering competence, facilities, and processes to produce a product to meet the Government’s needs; and, due to this engineering competence and capability, NEA is uniquely qualified to make the simple modifications to its existing product to meet the needs of the Government in the required timeframe.  To ensure meeting the 2008 launch readiness date with acceptable technical and schedule risk, the Restraint and Release Mechanisms must be delivered by early spring of 2007.  NEA Electronics is the only source that can meet this deadline.	 The estimated period of performance of this firm-fixed-price (FFP) effort is approximately 4 months. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See Notes 22, 26, and B. Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work, should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis. Interested organizations have 15 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their qualifications/capabilities. Such qualifications/capabilities will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Responses received after the 15 days or without the required information will be considered non-responsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. A determination by the Government to not compete this proposed effort on a full and open competitive basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by the agency.  Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for technical representative services at Ellington Field to support maintenance of the General Electric J-85 Engines installed in NASA/JSC's T-38N Fleet.	The technical representative is required to function as a liaison between General Electric and NASA/JSC personnel.  The period of performance for this requirement is one year.  The period of performance begins January 1, 2007 and ends December 31, 2007.    NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from General Electric on a sole source basis. This determination was reached based on the fact that General Electric has all of the proprietary information rights for General Electric J-85 Engines. This proprietary information is unobtainable from sources outside of General Electric. Thus, General Electric is the only known source capable of meeting all of NASA/JSC's requirements for this procurement.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on November 22, 2006.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 54199   Title: "Wetlands Environmental Protection and Management Grants." Response Date: 2:00 p.m. on November 23, 2006 Eastern Standard Time (Washington, D.C.) THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE PROCUREMENT, NOT A RFQ Notice of intent to negotiate and award a sole source task order under  the Simplified Acquisition Procedure to the Environmental Law Institute (ELI) for services to support Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Wetlands, Oceans and Watersheds' Wetlands Division under GSA contract # GS-10F-0330P.  Under this task order, ELI will administer the National  Wetlands Award Program.  Through the administration of the Awards Program, ELI seeks to continue to assist a wide array of stakeholders by providing comprehensive, unbiased, and reliable information on wetlands science, law, and policy.  The final products will include administration of an annual  awards program and a ceremony to be held in spring of 2007.  The National Wetlands Awards Program honors individuals who have demonstrated outstanding innovation and dedication in education and outreach, science research, conservation and restoration, wetland community leadership, private land  stewardship, and state, tribal, or local program development related to wetlands.  The nominees and winners provide critical examples of how individual citizens across the country can, and do, make a difference in wetlands protection and restoration efforts.  The U.S. EPA is one of several  co-sponsors, demonstrating the true collaborative effort associated with wetland protection in the United States.  A determination not to compete this proposed task order has been made because ELI has administered the National Wetlands Awards program in cooperation with the U.S. EPA since 1989 and  has built formal linkages with various groups, including trade and professional associates, non-profit organizations, and governmental agencies.  ELI is an internationally recognized, independent research and education center that has successfully developed and distributed a series of positive  press stories about the work of Award nominees in the past.  Through its information services, high caliber training courses and seminars, critical research programs, and policy recommendations, the Institute activates a broad constituency of environmental professions in government, industry, the  private bar, public interest groups, and academia. This is not a request for quotation.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. EPA, Stacey Wolejko (3803R) 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20460, or to facsimile number (202) 565-2560, or sent by email to  wolejko.stacey@epa.gov.  Response to this notice must be submitted within fifteen (15) days after this electronic posting.  Consideration of the responses is solely within discretion of the Government, generally for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Please  include your number, point of contact, address area code, telephone number, and facsimile number.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:  Advanced Track Illuminator Laser (ATILL)

A.  INTRODUCTION:
The Department of Defense (DoD) is interested in receiving proposals for a high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) development program.  Based on research the Government has funded and/or reviewed, it is believed that the requirements of this BAA procurement can best be met with a cryogenically cooled, Ytterbium-doped YAG (Yb:YAG) laser that operates at ~1.03 microns.  However, the Government is also willing to consider other DPSSL approaches that have a lasing wavelength of ~1.03 microns.  The program will be conducted as a joint effort involving MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL) and industry.  MIT/LL will have primary responsibility for risk reduction and laboratory breadboard research and development.  Industry will be responsible for working with MIT/LL on defining the risk reduction research efforts, transferring technology from MIT/LL, and developing a brassboard laser design.  The MIT/LL and industry efforts will be funded separately by the Government.  The industry program will consist of four phases: Phase 1 will cover technology transfer from MIT/LL to industry, a system performance trade assessment of the BAA technical requirements, preliminary laser system modeling and simulation (based on information/data provided by MIT/LL to industry), and a brassboard concept design review (CoDR).  The Phase 1 system performance trade assessment will allow the contractor to perform a detailed evaluation of their proposed design, covering system performance and packaging parameters such as laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.  The primary purpose of the system performance trade assessment is to arrive at a design for airborne applications that optimally balances laser technical performance with system packaging, maintainability and reliability constraints.  As part of the trade assessment, the contractor will also generate an error budget tree for identifying and monitoring key technical performance and packaging issues during all phases of the technical effort.  Phase 2 (Option A) will provide technology transfer from MIT/LL to industry, laser system modeling and simulation, a brassboard preliminary design review (PDR), and a preliminary cost estimate proposal for building a TRL 6 brassboard during Phase 4 (Option C).  Phase 3 (Option B) will provide technology transfer from MIT/LL to industry, laser system modeling and simulation, a critical design review (CDR), and a final cost proposal for building a TRL 6 brassboard during Phase 4 (Option C).  If this last contract option is exercised, the Government will only select one industry partner to fabricate the TRL 6 brassboard laser system.  The brassboard design effort in Phases 1 through 3 is for a ruggedized, flight-qualifiable laser brassboard (TRL 6) that meets all technical performance and packaging requirements listed herein.  Deliverables will be those called out in BAA AL-2007-01.  As noted above, delivery of a ruggedized brassboard laser is an optional part of this program solicitation for which funding has not been identified.  The total program budget for the industry technical effort is approximately ~$1M for Phase 1, ~$2M for Phase 2, and ~$10M to ~$12M for Phase 3 (up to ~$15M total funding over ~2.5 years).  Depending on funds availability and quality of the BAA technical proposals, one or two contractors may be funded for the first phase, which should be for approximately 6 months at ~$500K per effort.  If appropriate, one or two contractors may be funded for the second phase (~12 months).  If appropriate, one or two contractors may be funded for the third phase (~24 months).  The projected start date is at the beginning of the third quarter GFY07.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Stephen G. Post, MDA/AL, 505-853-3811, is encouraged until proposals are received.  Contracting questions should be directed to Ms. Susan McDaniel, MDA/ALK, at 505-853-1005.  In addition, the DoD proposal evaluation team may contact an offeror to clarify a point of information before completing the proposal evaluation process.

B.  TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:
During the first three phases of this Advanced Track Illuminator Laser development program, all industry modeling and simulation shall be validated by risk reduction experiments and testing of the laboratory breadboard at MIT/LL.  Any contractor funded for the fourth phase of this Advanced Track Illuminator Laser development program will use modeling and simulation to support design, development and delivery of a 6 kW-class, near diffraction limited, diode-pumped solid-state laser to the DoD.  Emphasis will be placed on solid-state laser architectures that are favorable in terms of size, weight, efficiency, affordability, reliability, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability (for airborne platforms), and ruggedness.  The contractor(s) is(are) expected to address these issues both in the proposal and throughout program execution.

ATILL technical performance goals:

1)  Wavelength: The laser wavelength shall be at ~1.03 microns.
2)  Radiance (W/cm^2-sr): The Radiance (Brightness) of the laser output beam shall be greater than or equal to a laser of 6 kW average power with a Beam Quality (BQ) better than or equal to 1.5 times the diffraction limit (xDL) as directly measured by a far-field power-in-the-bucket (PITB) technique, where the bucket extent is nominally defined by the energy/power contained in the laser?s far-field central lobe.  The laser shall have a minimum average output power of 5.0 kW over the entire run-time duration specified in paragraph (a) below.
3)  Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF): The laser's PRF shall nominally be 5.0 kHz, variable plus or minus 15 percent with a controlled PRF slew rate of up to 1500 Hertz per second.
4)  Pulse Length: The laser's full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) temporal pulse length shall be less than or equal to 15 ns, with a goal of less than or equal to 5 ns.  As part of the laser system trade study during the first contract phase, the effect of pulse length on laser system performance and reliability will be investigated.
5)  Coherence Length: The laser output temporal coherence length shall be less than or equal to 5 centimeters (goal of 2 centimeters).
6)  Polarization: The laser output polarization shall be linear with a contrast ratio of greater than 100 to 1.
7)  Beam Jitter: The total beam jitter shall be no greater than 10% of the far-field instantaneous beam diameter as measured at the FWHM power points.  The contractor should assume that the laser will be mounted on an isolated table (i.e., the table will not induce jitter in the laser head).
8)  Pulse-to-Pulse Energy Stability: The pulse-to-pulse energy variation shall not exceed plus/minus 2 percent.

ATILL packaging goals:

a)  Run Time: The laser brassboard shall be designed to operate continuously for at least 300 seconds (goal of 600 s).  All performance measurements on the Phase 1 sub-scale and Phase 2 full-scale laboratory devices (power, beam quality, efficiency, beam jitter, etc.) shall be recorded over a time period of at least 300 s.  Additionally, the device shall be capable of reasonable on/off cycling (e.g., ten or more twenty-second bursts with five-second periods of non-lasing between bursts, then return to stand-by).  In this mode of operation, the requisite run time only includes the sum of the 'laser on' periods.  The laser power supply and cooling system recycle times are mission and platform dependent; recycle time impact on system weight, volume, efficiency, etc., will be evaluated as part of the Phase 1 system performance trade assessments.
b)  Hold Time:  The laser brassboard shall be designed to store sufficient cryogen such that the laser will be able to run at full output power for at least 300 seconds even if the cryostat was filled with cryogen more than 40 hours prior to any laser operation.  This hold time requirement should be met for any environmental conditions discussed herein.
c)  Start-Up Time: The laser start-up time, defined as the time required to transition from a stand-by condition (defined during the Phase 1 system performance trade study) to a condition where all output requirements are met, shall be no more than 1 second.
d)  Wallplug Efficiency: The laser wallplug efficiency shall be greater than or equal to 10% (goal of 12%), where wallplug efficiency is defined as the average optical output power of the laser divided by the sum of all electrical average power delivered to all power supplies, drivers, cooling systems, pumps, and control devices used to operate the laser.  The contractor is required to design a 6 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
e)  Output Power-To-Mass Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration efforts, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their laser brassboard design will meet an output power-to-mass ratio requirement of 10 W/kg (goal of 12 W/kg) for a nominal 6 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total system mass of less than 600 kg (goal of 500 kg).  The laser is nominally defined as the laser head plus the system heat exchangers (no externally available thermal reservoir should be assumed), power supplies, controller, wiring, tubing, etc.  The laser head typically includes gain media and associated fixed attachments (diodes, heat exchanger manifolds, mechanical structures, etc), optics, mounts, along with an optical mounting assembly, cover, and other necessary fixtures.  The contractor is required to design a 6 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
f)  Output Power-To-Volume Ratio: During the system trade study, risk reduction and laboratory demonstration phases, the contractor must clearly show through appropriate systems engineering methodology and calculations that their deliverable brassboard laser will meet an output power-to-volume ratio of 10 W/liter (goal of 20 W/liter) for a nominal 6 kW average power laser system, which equates to a total volume of less than or equal to 0.6 cubic meters (goal of less than or equal to 0.3 cubic meters).  See item (d) for a definition of what constitutes the laser system.  The contractor is required to design a 6 kW-class laser brassboard meeting this specification for airborne applications.
g)  Temperature Range: The ambient operating temperature range of the laser brassboard design for ground-based and airborne applications shall be 15 to 35 degrees C, and its storage temperature range shall be ?54 to 50 degrees C.  Herein, 'storage' is defined as the periods between tests or missions (e.g., an aircraft in an unheated aircraft hanger).
h)  Humidity: For ground-based operations, up to 95% humidity from 2 to 35 degrees C; for airborne applications, up to 85% humidity from 15 to 35 degrees C.
i)  Operating/Storage Pressure: Minus 1,000 ft to plus 10,000 ft.
j)  Platform operating angles, acceleration, vibration, shock, and other operating/storage parameters will be provided early in Phase 1 during the system performance trade assessment effort.  As a minimum, offerors should provide a laser system design that is compatible with an airborne environment similar to a 747-type aircraft.

For item (2), the contractor shall discuss in their proposal how they intend to measure the laser's Radiance (Brightness), output power and beam quality and what the possible technical issues are in making such measurements.  Additionally, the contractor shall provide in their proposal a discussion of beam quality based on PITB (not M-squared).  The contractor must also define and discuss how measurements will be made for items (3) through (8) and (a) through (j).  Again, it is noted here that, though a laser system brassboard design shall be developed through PDR level during Phase 2 and CDR level during Phase 3, there is no laser system brassboard deliverable for the future BAA.

As noted previously, the program shall be carried out in three phases, with a forth phase carried as an unpriced option on the initial contract.  Each phase shall be priced separately, with Phase 1 offered as the basic contract and Phases 2 and 3 offered as contract options.  It is also noted here that hardware procured and used in Phase 1 may be also used in the Phases 2 and 3 contract options (if exercised).

As part of the brassboard laser system design effort, the contractor will ensure through appropriate evaluation/assessment techniques that the laser beam's output characteristics do not somehow preclude ready insertion into an agreed upon beam delivery system at a Government facility or on a specified platform.  This effort will be included in the Phase 1 system performance trade assessment, which as mentioned previously will also cover laser wavelength, average power, beam quality, pulse repetition frequency, pulse length, run-time and recycle time, start-up time, wallplug efficiency, output power to mass/volume ratios, operating/storage temperature ranges, operating/storage humidity ranges, and other operating/storage environmental specifications.

For the intended BAA solicitation, flight qualifiable means that the laser brassboard is designed to undergo flight qualification testing with minimal system hardware/software changes required.  This approximately corresponds to a Technology Readiness Level 6.

The proposal expectations (NOT for the RFI) are as follows: Offerors shall limit the length of their Technical Proposals to 75 pages or less (12 point font), including all pages (no exceptions).  Additional information on required fonts, page formatting, etc., may be found in the BAA Proposal Preparation Instructions (to be added when the BAA is published).  Cost proposals will be limited in length to 50 pages or less, including all cost sheets, basis of estimates and other supporting information.  Cost proposal preparation instructions will be included in the RFP package when the BAA is issued.  As part of the Technical Proposal, offerors must clearly demonstrate through past performance and corporate/institutional capabilities that they possess the resources and technical capabilities necessary to perform successfully on the BAA.  This should include identified experience designing, developing, fabricating, and testing ruggedized (TRL ~6), fieldable, high Radiance, high average power diode-pumped solid-state laser systems.  The Government encourages any interested, qualified not-for-profit laboratories/institutions (e.g., FFRDCs) or Universities that are based in the United States to team, or form suitable partnering relationships in conformance with their by laws and applicable statutes and regulations, with qualified industrial partners on this solicitation.  The intent of the intended BAA is to develop, in the first three contract phases, the technology and industrial base necessary to build a ruggedized, ~1.03 micron wavelength, high average power, diode-pumped solid-state laser system (TRL 6) that may be procured as part of contract Phase 4 (Option C).  As part of the response to the BAA, the offeror should provide a Phase 4 brassboard ROM cost and schedule.

Following are questions supporting the ATILL RFI and comments on any recommended clarifications involving the aforementioned RFI:

1)  Are the proposed ATILL technical requirements achievable with currently available technology?  Are there any technical requirements that are considered to be especially difficult to achieve with currently available technology?

2)  Are the proposed schedule and funding appropriate for the proposed ATILL technology development program?

3)  What text changes and/or clarifications, if any, are recommended for the proposed ATILL BAA?

4)  A brief explanation of company/organization/institution resources and technical capabilities available/necessary to perform successfully on the proposed BAA.

5)  Are you a company that has the capability to provide the requested hardware and are also eligible for a certain type of set-aside? If so, please note briefly your capabilities and the type of set-aside. Discussing the matter with the techical POC would also be beneficial to ensure you are fully capable prior to the Government establishing a set-aside.

Responses to this Request For Information (RFI) are due no later than Close of Business on *** 08 December 2006 ***.

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<SUBJECT>A--Sources Sought - Development and Design of a Passive Aerosol Sampler Shelter
<SOLNBR>RFQ-RT-07-00022
<RESPDATE>112006
<ARCHDATE>12202006
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Rebecca Clausen, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3002
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541710   THIS MODIFICATION IS TO ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE LOCATION TO BE IN IOWA CITY  AND TO CHANGE THE TESTING REQUIREMENT OF "THREE SNOW EVENTS" TO "THREE SNOW EVENTS (IF POSSIBLE)". The purpose of this synopsis is to conduct a market search for businesses or other  organizations with the demonstrated capability to design and test a shelter that isolates a passive aerosol sampler for particulate matter (PM) from wind and precipitation and conduct a field evaluation of the sheltered passive sampler. The US EPA's National Exposure Research Laboratory (NERL) is  currently conducting field evaluations of a passive aerosol sampler for particulate matter (PM). The Wagner-Leith passive sampler (Wagner and Leith, 2001a, 2001b, 2001c) shows potential for assessing PM exposure because it can be operated without a power source and can be miniaturized, making their  deployment at multiple locations easy and cost-effective. Initial tests of the passive sampler have shown mixed results in terms of the sampler's ability to measure ambient mass concentrations with acceptable accuracy and precision. Different rain shelter designs for the passive sampler have been  used in these initial field tests and may account in part for observed differences between passive and actively-measured mass concentrations.  The contractor shall:   (1) Design and test a shelter that isolates the passive sampler from wind and precipitation. The ideal shelter is one that affords  protection from most precipitation events, minimally affects particle deposition velocity, and is inexpensive. (The goal is to keep the cost of the shelter less than the passive sampler which is currently about $45).  The performance of the shelter in terms of its impact on the accuracy of the  passive sampler PM measurements must be characterized over a range of wind speeds encountered in ambient monitoring. The contractor shall conduct wind tunnel tests at 0, 2, 8, and 24 km/hr on a passive sampler protected by a candidate shelter. PM10-2.5 estimated with the sheltered passive sampler  will be compared to that measured with a collocated dichotomous sampler and a collocated unsheltered passive sampler. (The deposition model developed by Wagner and Leith to estimate mass concentrations from passive samplers was empirically based on tests conducted with unsheltered passive samplers.  The unsheltered passive sampler is therefore expected to yield the best agreement with active samplers). Three replicate sheltered samplers will be exposed at each wind speed to assess precision.  The proposed shelter should demonstrate adequate shielding against precipitation events. Three  sheltered passive samplers will be placed outdoors and exposed to a minimum of three rain events and three snow events (if possible). The passive samplers will be visually inspected for moisture during and after each precipitation event and the inspection results will be recorded in a log. At the  conclusion of these tests, it may be necessary to examine the samplers by microscopy in order to assess the integrity of the samplers. If requested, these samples shall be made available to the EPA for analysis;  (2) Conduct a field evaluation of the sheltered passive sampler. Using the shelter  developed in Task 1, the contractor shall monitor PM10-2.5 for five days at two locations. Each monitoring site shall be equipped with 3 sheltered and 3 naked passive samplers (to assess precision), a dichot sampler for PM10-2.5, and a wind speed monitor to provide hourly and average wind speed for  the 5-day monitoring period. Because unsheltered samplers will be deployed, it will be necessary to perform the field evaluation during 5-day periods when no precipitation occurs. If possible, the sampling should take place simultaneously at both sites (to see if the passive sampler can distinguish  two different monitoring locations within the same urban airshed), but this is not a requirement. The contractor shall repeat the 5-day field test detailed above a second time. PM10-2.5 from the passive samplers (sheltered and unsheltered) will be linearly regressed against PM10-2.5 measured with  the dichotomous sampler. The accuracy and precision of the sheltered and unsheltered passive samplers for PM10-2.5 mass will be determined by comparison with the dichot sampler results.  The EPA is requesting capability statements in response to this synopsis.  The statement should detail your  organization's experience with this type of sampler and with shelters for passive aerosol samplers.  The capability statement should also include your organization's size determination.  To be considered a small business, this procurement will utilize NAICS code 541710 "Research and Development in  the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences" with a size standard of 500 employees or less. The information submitted will be evaluated and used to determine what sources can provide the services, and whether or not this procurement may be set aside for small businesses.  Otherwise, this  procurement will be subject to full and open competition.  The US Environmental Protection Agency, 109 T.W. Alexander Drive, Research Triangle Park NC intends to award a purchase order for the above services.  All capability statements are due by 12:00 p.m. ET on November 20, 2006.  If submitting  your capability statement via the US Postal Service, please use the following address: US Environmental Protection Agency, Attention: Rebecca Clausen, RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.  If submitting your capability statement via courier, please use  the following address: US Environmental Protection Agency, Attention: Rebecca Clausen RTP Procurement Operations Division (E105-02), 4930 Page Road, Durham, NC 27703.

In accordance with FAR 10.001(a)(2) the Social Security Administration (SSA) is conducting market research before developing requirements for possible acquisition of two (2) Anue Systems Inc. network emulators, associated hardware interfaces and software to meet SSA's disaster recovery needs.  This is a Sources Sought announcement, a market survey for electronic/written information.  This is not a solicitation announcement for proposals.  No contract will be awarded.  This is a request for information only.
</p> <p>
SSA will pursue acquiring Anue network emulator products to allow the Agency to simulate the delays and impairments that occur over live production synchronous optical networking (SONET), synchronous digital hierarchy (SDH), optical transport network (OTN) and other networks.  SSA will use these products to validate and evaluate new hardware or software products and technologies under real world conditions in a controlled lab environment.  The primary applications for the emulator include validation of signal fail and degrade alarm threshold algorithms, facilitating automatic protection switch testing under the presence of persistent bit errors, loss of signal, validation of disaster recovery and storage extension solutions, real world interoperability, and proof of concept testing. 
</p> <p>
SSA intends to deploy Anue CKL-2U Rack mountable chassis with uni- or bi-directional emulation, along with Anue H10 Network Emulator Hardware blades, and 850-nanometer and 1310-nanometer optics to provide OC-192/STM-64, OC-48/STM-16, OC-3/12 / STM-1/4, 1 Gig and 10 Gig ethernet signal delay emulations.  The Agency intends to run Anue signal delay software for OC-192, OC-48, OC-12, OC-3, 1 Gig and 10 Gig in uni-directional and bi-directional testing. 
</p> <p>
Any firm that feels they have the capability of providing an equivalent product must respond, in writing, within 15 days of this notice.  Responses must be specific as to the alternate product proposed and must include detailed specifications to support claims of equivalency to Anue hardware and software detailed in this synopsis.  
</p> <p>
Vendors that believe they can offer a technically compliant product should submit information concerning their product?s capabilities.  Detailed responses to each of the above requirements (with substantiating documentation) are required.  SSA will not consider simple marketing information or incomplete responses.  SSA will not consider reference to vendor web sites as a valid response.  Vendors may submit pricing data.  Respondents should indicate whether their software is available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC).  
</p> <p>
Vendor?s shall submit responses electronically and be received by November 23, 2006.  SSA will not accept faxed information.  The size limitation for email attachments is 10 megabytes.  MS Word is the Agency's standard word processing software.  
</p> <p>
SSA IS NOT ISSUING A FORMAL SOLICITATION AT THIS TIME, and the Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted.  SSA will use this information in the assessment of capable sources.  SSA will not notify respondents of any evaluated results from the data received.  Any questions should be submitted via EMAIL ONLY (no phone calls please) to the Contract Specialist at: faith.goodacre@ssa.gov

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION


INTRODUCTION

The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) on behalf of the DOC Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). BEA is developing its requirements to design and administer a new survey that estimates travel expenditures in the International Transactions Accounts. The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather information to assist the BEA in formulating its requirements, and to identify qualified offerors who are capable of meeting the requirements.

BACKGROUND

BEA produces the International Transactions Accounts (ITAs) of the United States.  These accounts provide a comprehensive and detailed view of economic transactions between the United States and other countries.  In addition, they provide input into other estimates throughout BEA, contributing particularly to the National Income and Product Accounts.  The services transactions accounts are contained within the current account of the ITAs and are divided into several major categories. One of these major categories is travel.  BEA has identified weaknesses in the data covering travel expenditures.  This requirement will be concerned with improving BEA?s estimation of travel expenditures by designing and administering a new survey of travelers.

Accordingly, the BEA is soliciting input from the public to guide in developing such a survey.

DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED

All vendors providing commercial services relating to the requirements set forth in the attached Performance Work Statement are highly encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government is requesting that vendors submit information in the following three areas. 

Vendor Capabilities Statement. The Capability Statement should discuss the vendor?s capabilities as against the requirements. ?Capability? is broadly defined to include organizational experience, management and staffing structure, and past performance. As an example of demonstrating capability, vendors may provide copies of previous studies or reports that are similar in nature to the PWS requirements. 

Technical Solutions. Given the information in the PWS, it is requested that vendors provide a broad technical solution or approach to completing the PWS requirements. The Government is interested in knowing what innovative ideas are currently in the marketplace and how potential offerors may seek to fulfill the PWS requirements. To aid the technical approach, vendors are asked to provide a staffing plan describing the mix of labor (labor categories) and level of effort (approximate number of hours) necessary to complete all requirements. 

Suggestions for Improving the PWS. Vendors are highly encouraged to provide suggestions for improving the PWS. If there are any terms or topics that are ambiguous, or if timetables seem too restrictive to accommodate for more creative solutions, vendors are invited to constructively critique all aspects of the PWS and propose alternative suggestions. If information is lacking or not clear enough to provide suggestions, vendors may submit a list of questions which will be helpful in indicating details that should be added. Furthermore, attached to the PWS is a Quality Assurance Table which details core requirements, performance standards, and incentive/disincentive payments. Vendors are highly encouraged to propose alternative performance standards and incentive/disincentive payments. Currently provided in the QA table is a structure for how the Government will survey and evaluate contractor performance. 
 
HOW TO RESPOND

Vendors may use any electronic format to provide information for Vendor Capabilities Statement and Technical Solutions. In terms of providing Suggestions for Improving the PWS, vendors are encouraged to use this Word Document and insert comments using the Track Changes feature of Microsoft Word. 

Please submit your response to this RFI via email to Temujene H. Makua at Temujene.H.Makua@noaa.gov by Monday, December 4, 2006, at 12:00 P.M. EST


DISCLAIMER

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. Respondents needing confidential treatment for any proprietary information furnished must comply with the BEA?s confidential treatment regulations at 17 C.F.R. 200.83. Responses to this RFI will not be returned. Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. The Government may contact vendors for follow-up information or clarification.


52.215-3  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997) 

(a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. 
(b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.

<DESC>The Bureau of Census National Processing Center in Jeffersonville, Indiana, is seeking possible sources for corrugated desks, room dividers, and tables for use during the next decennial Census in approximately 500 temporary local offices, a quarter to one third of which may open in the fall of 2008, with the remainder opening in the fall of 2009.  A formal agreement would be an indefinite quantity and indefinite delivery contract.  Quantities for the items may range between 20,000 to as many as 50,000 units each, and deliveries may be required beginning in the fall of 2008 and last through 2011.  In the previous decennial Census, corrugated furniture was acquired whereby the items were packaged in groups of six, and in the case of the desks and tables, unassembled but with each package of six units accompanied by an assembly instruction sheet.
All corrugated furniture will have to meet various flame and/or fire retardant requirements and MSD sheets specifying the retardant material(s) would be required.  The Census Bureau may ask to take possession of designs and/or dies used in the development and production of the furniture.  Delivery would be to the Census Bureau in Jeffersonville, Indiana, although some deliveries may be required throughout CONUS.  Dividers shall be 108 inches wide by 72 inches high.  Desks and tables shall be 48x30x29.  Desks should have open left and right hand shelving.  The idea behind the corrugated furniture is to obtain inexpensive temporary furniture that can be easily stored and shipped and disposed of in a recyclable manner.  The Census Bureau is interested in discussing designs, production, and delivery of corrugated furniture with appropriate responsible parties with experience in corrugated materials.

<DESC>Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Procurement and Grants Office (Atlanta), 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3000, Atlanta, GA, 30341-4146

	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking potential offerors who have the capabilities of procuring Opportunistic Infection Drugs (OI) and Home Based Care Drugs & Products within and for Vietnam.  The Government intends to award an Unpriced Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order that will consist of a 6 month base period with four six month option period.  The offerors will be required to undertake the product procurement through an open quotation system.  The products are procured on open bid, with a minimum of three quotations required for each product.  The product with the lowest cost, which can meet all of the specifications and quality requirement, is then procured. Attached A is a sample list of OI Drugs that may be required to be purchased under the purchase order.
	
	Under Vietnam law and regulation only a registered and licensed pharmaceutical distributor may undertake physical distribution of pharmaceutical products. Additionally, PEPFAR Vietnam is currently operating in 40 provinces of Vietnam with a wide geographical range from the far Northern area to the far Southern area of the country – a longitudinal spread of around 2,000 Kms.  The contractor must be able to operate over a wide geographical range.
	
	The volume of medicines to be provided by PEPFAR, although small in comparison to the total country requirement, is nevertheless a significant proportion in relation to the central level public sector supply. Therefore the contractor must currently have high capacity volume capabilities and have adequate capacity to store and undertake the physical distribution volumes of medicines required by PEPFAR Vietnam.

	Because a number of treatment sites have very low storage capacity for medicines, it is a requirement that the contractor store medicines and undertake frequent small deliveries to the treatment sites. Further, storage is required to hold emergency stocks and buffer stocks against possible unforeseen circumstances and erratic usage patterns.

It is a Ministry of Health (MoH) requirement, {Extraordinary Letter No. 6036/QLD-CL Ministry of Health, Drug Administration of Vietnam, Attention: Pharmaceutical Companies, enterprises attaining Good Practices (GPs)} that all new operations, must use only storage facilities that have ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) GSP (Good Storage Practice) certification.

It is a MoH and MoF requirement that all proposed medicine distribution must be approved in advance by both Ministries.

All offerors who are to procure, store and distribute medicines destined for use within the public sector of Vietnam must receive specific approval for each activity from both the MoH and MoF.

Interested firms are invited to submit a statement of capability demonstrating their experience, capability and all Governmental approvals to fulfill the Government’s requirement.  The statement of capabilities should be limited to five (5) pages and should include: company name, company address, contact name, contact telephone number, contact fax number, and contact email address.
     
One copy of the capability statement must be received at the address listed below no later then 15 calendar days from date posted on FedBizOpps (July 25, 2006).  Capability statements should be sent to: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Procurements and Grants Office (PGO), Mail Stop, K75 Attn: John Ebanks, Contract Specialist, 2920 Brandywine Rd, Atlanta, GA 30341-5539 or by electronic mail to egz2@cdc.gov.

Responses via facsimile (FAX) WILL NOT be accepted.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes ONLY and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, or will the Government pay for information solicited.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether more than one firm possesses the capability to fulfill the Governments requirement.

The system will be referenced as the Mission Payload Module-Non-Lethal Weapons System (MPM-NLWS). The Marine Corps and Joint Forces have a mission to move into urban areas and confront force belligerent personnel by using this counter-personnel non-lethal weapons system to provide an improved non-lethal capability to control crowds, deny/defend areas, controlling access and engaging threats while providing increased stando!  ff for protection of friendly forces.  The Marines Corps is seeking so lutions and design concepts from industry for tube launched and other types of munitions and payload technologies that will be capable of incapacitating, disorienting, and distracting human targets at greater ranges, and provide greater area coverage and duration of effects than current NLW systems. This system must be able to be mounted onto the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV) with the capability to be dismounted to provide a range of non-lethal weapons effects.  The equipment shall be fully capable of being operated, maintained and stored in hot, ambient, and cold temperatures and rugged enough to withstand the rigors of convoy operations in an urban environment.  To expedite the RFI process, two types of data will be collected for this market research.

Description:

1. The Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate invites system integrators and government sponsors of information systems projects to attend the DHS S&T System Integrator Forum (SIF) on January 17, 2007, at 1100 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 2800 (28th floor), Arlington, VA 22209, or a similar location, from 8:00am to 4:00pm. The event will showcase several new cyber security solutions funded by the DHS S&T that aim to remediate Federal and commercial cyber security vulnerabilities. 

2. The goal of the DHS S&T System Integrator Forum is to introduce high-quality, top-performing research companies to large integrators of technology who serve the Federal Government and private industry. Each of the presenting technology developers have completed cyber security technology development projects funded under DHS Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) or Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) programs. They have been selected for participation in the SIF based upon the maturity of their technology solution, relevance to government needs, the apparent commercial viability of their approach, and their business leadership. These technology solutions represent cutting-edge innovations with the potential to improve the security of the nation's cyber-infrastructure, while also reducing the costs required to protect cyber assets from attacks.

3. Those interested in attending the DHS S&T System Integrator Forum should represent an information services company that specializes in integrating information systems and corresponding security capabilities that meet Federal Government and private industry requirements. The SIF is the ideal venue for system integrators, chief technology officers, chief information officers, chief information systems security officers, purchasing decision-makers, and government sponsors of system integration programs to learn about opportunities to integrate capabilities resulting from DHS S&T?s efforts to further developments in cyber security technology. The event is NOT a venue for researchers or small businesses seeking funding or networking opportunities.

4.  The DHS reserves the right to modify the agenda until the date of the event, but the forum may include the following presentations:  

a. Next generation intrusion detection and prevention systems designed to stop zero-day, targeted, and internal network attacks.

b. Source code analysis solutions to eliminate costly errors in open source applications. 

c. Secure memory monitoring products to detect and remediate sophisticated kernel attacks, e.g. Rootkits, as well as compliance monitoring. This includes centrally managed low assurance software and high assurance hardware implementations.

d. Devices for auditing and investigating electronic transactions that provides reliable proof of transaction content without compromising privacy, degrading public key infrastructure, or interfering with applications.

e. Change Control solution protects critical infrastructure from outages caused by change or security-related incidents. 

f. A Vulnerability and Compliance Assessment System which improves the security, availability, and compliance of IP networks through non-intrusive analysis of device configurations. 

5. The event is free of charge.

6. Register for the DHS System Integrator Forum by December 8, 2006, by visiting http://www.cyber.st.dhs.gov/siforum.  Space is limited.

7. This announcement is not a request for proposal.

(a) Prohibitions.
Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause, or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of national security.
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:
Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for at least 80 percent each place it appears.
Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)?
(1) The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held?
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.
Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.  (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:
(i) Stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.
(d) Special Rule for Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights.
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:
(i) warrants;
(ii) options;
(iii) contracts to acquire stock;
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.
(f) Disclosure. The offeror under this solicitation represents that [Check one]: __ it is not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of (HSAR) 48 CFR 3009.104-70 through 3009.104-73;

(End of provision)
 
Notice to Offerors:  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  

Informal forum with the Ombudsman:  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman:  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011
 
The closing date for receipt of offers is 20 November 2006, 2:00 pm, EST.  Quotes will be accepted via Facsimile at 252-334-5240, electronically via Email at Sabrina.A.Tippins@uscg.mil or at the following address:

USCG, Aircraft Repair and Supply Center
Attn: Sabrina Tippins
HH65 Procurement, Building 75
Elizabeth City, NC 27909

Late submissions will not be accepted.  Anticipated award date is on or about 1 December 2006.  Quotes are to remain effective for 90 days after close of solicitation.  A company representative authorized to commit the company must sign this offer.  Contractors are encouraged to register with the FedBizOpps Vendor Notification Service (located on the FedBizOpps home page) to receive all notices for solicitation HSCG38-O7-Q-200009.  All questions pertaining to the solicitation must be in writing and may be e-mailed or faxed to Sabrina Tippins at Sabrina.A.Tippins@uscg.mil or (252) 334-5240.  Telephonic requests will not be honored.  POC for this solicitation is Sabrina Tippins 252-334-5407 or sabrina.a.tippins@uscg.mil.

The evaluation factor for award of this requirement will be based on lowest price obtained from a responsive and responsible offeror.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations(RFQ)for ITEM 1, Qty. 1, MTS Tytron or equal; ITEM 2, Qty. 1 Documentation; and ITEM 3, Qty. 1, Installation, Checkout and Training. Item 1 shall contain the following features and meet the salient characteristics listed below: ITEM 1:  MTS Tytron or equal This system shall allow characterization of materials and micro-components under both static and dynamic loads.  Types of samples may be:  standard dogbone samples, sheets, foils, wire, whiskers, small fragments of materials, micro-devices, and MEMs systems.  The test rig shall have the capability of conducting standard tests such as:  tensile, compression, bending, shear, creep, stress relaxation, LCF, HCF (up to at least 50 Hz). The system shall include all components necessary for complete system operation including load frame, control electronics, power supply, cables, plumbing and all necessary fittings and connectors.   The components of the test system are to be new.  No demonstration or used equipment shall be acceptable. The components of the system shall be of proven design with a history of satisfactory performance.  Unproven equipment, components, or concepts shall not be acceptable. Since the specimens are envisioned as being small, certain key factors are important that can affect the test results.  The vendor shall provide evidence of how the following items have been considered and minimized in the proposed equipment: -	External vibrations -	Electronic noise -	Thermal noise The unit shall be adaptable for extreme heating of the samples (up to 1200 °F), cryogenic cooling of the samples (-320 °F), conducting tests in inert atmospheres, all without abnormal effects to the test rig (insuring that the user undertakes reasonable protection of the equipment), which would render the data meaningless. Due to the extremely small size of the test samples, specimen alignment with the load train is critically important.	The vendor shall provide evidence that this has been considered and alignment mechanisms shall be discussed. To minimize mass effects, the load train should be horizontal rather than vertical. The test rig shall be designed for low force and stable application of the force/motion.  Excessive friction and loads due to sliding forces are not acceptable, nor is excessive movement which would create instabilities in the force application. Monotonic displacement rates between 1 micron/hour and 500 mm/sec are required. Forces shall be measured over a range of values from 0.001N to 250N.  The use of various sized force measuring devices is acceptable to achieve this range. The rig shall be capable of at least 100 mm travel.  The rig shall also be adjustable such that various length specimens and gripping devices can be used.  The distance between the fixed ends shall be at least 500 mm. Fixtures for gripping various types of specimens shall also be provided. The test rig shall implement a controller, which shall interact with a PC for data acquisition and test control.  However, the rig shall also be able to run in a stand alone mode without the PC.  Suitable software shall be provided that allows implementation of the above mentioned test types.   The controller shall allow input of external test signals such as strain gages and temperatures and be capable of processing these signals into user-suitable values.  The controller shall also be capable of providing output signals to PCs, and analog and digital recording devices.  Digital I/O for triggering applications shall also be available. The test rig shall allow optical line of site to the sample such that optical displacement measuring devices and temperature measuring devices can be used during testing. The test system shall allow calibration of all controlling and resultant test parameters according to ANSI/NCSL Z540-1.	The entire unit shall not require returning to the vendor for yearly calibration. ITEM 2:  DOCUMENTATION One set of comprehensive hardware and software manuals, including schematics, which may include but is not limited to user, system, troubleshooting and maintenance.   ITEM 3:  INSTALLATION, CHECKOUT AND TRAINING A.  The contractor shall include all labor and travel expenses for installation and system performance verification at NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) at an agreed upon time within one month after delivery. The set-up shall insure that Item 1 meets all functionality specifications listed in this document.  Set-up shall be performed Monday-Friday, non-federal holidays, during normal business hours at NASA GRC (typically 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) B.  The contractor shall include a minimum of one person for one  day of on-site operational training to coincide with the system verification. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-09. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334519 and 500 respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. Delivery of Items 1 and 2 shall be to NASA Glenn Research Center, 21000 Brookpark Road, Cleveland, OH 44135 (Receiving, Bldg. 21) and is required within 60 days ARO.  Delivery shall be FOB Destination. The DPAS rating for this procurement is DO-C9.

<DESC>*  THIS RESPONSE IS DUE BY 10:00 AM ON 29 AUGUST 2006 *

Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Procurement and Grants Office (Atlanta), 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3000, Atlanta, GA, 30341-4146

       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking potential offerors who have the capabilities of procuring Opportunistic Infection Drugs (OI) and Home Based Care Drugs & Products within and for Vietnam; this is a Request for Quotation for providing these services and products.     The Government intends to award an Unpriced Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order that will consist of a 6 month base period with four six month option period.     The offerors will be required to undertake the product procurement through an open quotation system.     The products are procured on open bid, with a minimum of three quotations required for each product.     The product with the lowest cost, which can meet all of the specifications and quality requirement, is then procured. Included in this description is a sample list of OI Drugs that may be required to be purchased under the purchase order.
       
       Each offeror MUST submit ALL required certifications showing proof of meeting the government's requirements with their quotation, which are listed here:

       *  Under Vietnam law and regulation only a registered and licensed pharmaceutical distributor may undertake physical distribution of pharmaceutical products. Additionally, PEPFAR Vietnam is currently operating in 40 provinces of Vietnam with a wide geographical range from the far Northern area to the far Southern area of the country; a longitudinal spread of around 2,000 Kms.     The contractor must be able to operate over a wide geographical range.  
       
       *  The volume of medicines to be provided by PEPFAR, although small in comparison to the total country requirement, is nevertheless a significant proportion in relation to the central level public sector supply. Therefore the contractor must currently have high capacity volume capabilities and have adequate capacity to store and undertake the physical distribution volumes of medicines required by PEPFAR Vietnam.

       *  Because a number of treatment sites have very low storage capacity for medicines, it is a requirement that the contractor store medicines and undertake frequent small deliveries to the treatment sites. Further, storage is required to hold emergency stocks and buffer stocks against possible unforeseen circumstances and erratic usage patterns.

       *  It is a Ministry of Health (MoH) requirement, {Extraordinary Letter No. 6036/QLD-CL Ministry of Health, Drug Administration of Vietnam, Attention: Pharmaceutical Companies, enterprises attaining Good Practices (GPs)} that all new operations, must use only storage facilities that have ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) GSP (Good Storage Practice) certification.

      *  It is a MoH and MoF requirement that all proposed medicine distribution must be approved in advance by both Ministries.

      *  All offerors who are to procure, store and distribute medicines destined for use within the public sector of Vietnam must have within their possession/on file specific approval for each activity from both the MoH and MoF.

The Request for Quotations for this solicitation along with all proof of certification requirements MUST be emailed by electronic mail to egz2@cdc.gov (FIRST PREFERENCE) OR (IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO EMAIL) by mail delivered to: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mail Stop, K75 Attn: John Ebanks, Contract Specialist, 2920 Brandywine Rd, Atlanta, GA 30341-5539.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Laser scanning to produce 3D computer models
<SOLNBR>R1WH17000607

<CONTACT>Doug Punzel, Contracting Officer, Phone 617-565-5769, Fax 617-565-5748, Email douglas.punzel@gsa.gov
<DESC>This amendment is issued to post answers to questions concerning solicitation number R1WH17000607, Laser Scanning of the USS San Antonio ship board space and associated vehicles and cargo. *********************************************************
Question #1.   Page 8 specifies linear accuracy of +/- 0.1 ft, area accuracy of +/- 0.01 sq in and volume accuracy of +/- 0.001.  We will be calculating areas and volumes based on linear measurements, and the accuracy of the calculated values cannot be tighter than the accuracy of the starting measured lengths.  Also, the above linear accuracy differs from the +/- 0.025 ft requirement on page 9. Please clarify these requirements.***
Answer #1.  The intent of the linear, area and volume accuracy is based on fundamental formulas. For example a linear measurement of 100 feet +/- .1 feet results in an actual measurement between 99 and 101 feet. The area of a rectangle based on these measurements would be between 9801 and 10201. If the (+/-) .1 standard were to hold on an area measurement the calculation could be off by 1000 square feet which is unacceptable. 
The requirement on page 9 for "(+/-) 0.025 FT" is related to the scans of vehicles, equipment and cargo. These are 3 dimensional scans of the exterior of these objects. This requirement is separate from the accuracy of the volumetric scans of the inside of the ship.**********
Question #2. The basic Load Path Validation requirement from pages 9-10 is for simulation of 5 different vehicles through a total of 19 different paths, i.e. 19 separate simulations.  But this section also states that ?Up to two preliminary outputs and revisions to the path sequences should be expected?.  It?s not clear from this statement how many additional simulations will be required.  Please clarify.*** 
Answer #2. In the best case scenario each simulation will be acceptable on the first try however experience indicates that some rework may be required. The statement "Up to two preliminary outputs and revisions to the path sequences should be expected" is to allow contractors to build in contingencies into the project plan.********** 
Question #3. The vehicles/payloads for which load path validation is required include the HMMWV, M198 howitzer, and QUADCON containers which are not required to be scanned per page 8.  Will dimensional data be provided for these?***
Answer #3. On Page 8 there is a statement that reads:
"Ten (10) 10 USMC vehicles/vehicle combinations (no larger than the MTVR 7.0 ton truck);"  These would include the above mentioned items.**********
Question #4. It is assumed that the three forklifts to be scanned per page 8 are the three specific forklifts identified under Load Path Evaluation on page 9.   Is this correct? ***
Answer #4.  Your understanding is correct.
***************************
All interested offerors can request a copy of the PWS/Solicitation and/or questions from the Contracting Officer Doug Punzel at Douglas.Punzel@gsa.gov (617-565-5769) AND Jim Fahey at James.Fahey@gsa.gov  (617-565-5170).**********

<DESC>This Amendment #02 is sissued to post answers to questions (5-11) (1-4 was posted in amendment 01) concerning solicitation #  R1WH17000607, Laser Scanning of the USS San Antonio ship board space and associated vehicles and cargo.  
Question #5.  For the "Full Volumetric Scans" identified on Page 8, do you know which vehicles will be scanned at which sites?  Is there any further definition of the list of vehicles? ***** 
Answer # 5.  No.  The RFP lists the vehicles/equipment and possible locations.  Travel will be cost-reimbursable.********** 
Question #6.  Can we assume a relatively low level of visual obstruction for the internal shipboard compartments?  For example, will the spaces not contain any of the larger vehicles? ***** 
Answer #6.  Whether or not there are vehicles onboard is not addressed in this task. That is up to the ship and what is loaded onboard at the ship at that time.  Yes, you may assume a relatively low level of visual obstruction although there will be no guarantee of it. **********  
Question #7.  Should we assume 1st shift (daytime) access for the scanning operations and how long of a day can we operate?  Should we expect any interruptions in scanning due to normal shipboard activity? ***** 
Answer#7.  Since there is no exact date as yet to initiate the scanning portion, once the contract is awarded to the successful offeror, the logistical aspects of work hours so as not to effect ship schedules will be adhered to and/or will be worked out prior to arrival onboard with ship personnel by the awarding government office's representative and the successful offeror. For proposal purposes, utilize normal daytime/non-premium and expect no interruptions during normal shipboard activity.  It is impossible to predict the future. ********** 
Question #8.  Does each shipboard compartment contain existing dimensional control points?  If so roughly how many?  Are they sufficient for obtaining shipboard coordinate control?  Will the coordinate values for these control points be provided? *****
Answer #8.  There are no dimension control points provided by the US Navy. It will be up to the winning offeror to set. ********** 
Question #9.  We would like to get a better understanding on the level of resolution required for the scanning and CAD modeling of the compartments and vehicles.  For example for the internal shipboard spaces, do you need any existing piping, electrical panels, hatch rims, lighting fixtures, or any other non-structural features? ***** 
Answer #9.  The task is to provide a scan of the each compartment listed, the whole compartment including any equipment/material permanently installed onboard. ********** 
Question #10.  Will we be able to use any on-board manlifts, ladders, or platforms for the scanning?  Will we have access to on-board conventional power?  Can we store equipment in the evenings in a secure space? *****
Answer #10.  No, the scan equipment is owned and operated by the winning offeror and the equipment is under his or her care for the time onboard the ship. The shipboard equipment is owned by the ship and not available to civilians. There will not be any Government provided equipment and if compatible, power may be provided.  The Government will not be responsible for the contractors equipment.**********
Question #11.  Can we submit with our proposal an example of our 3D animations and CAD modeling created from previous related scanning projects? ***** 
Answer #11.  You can, but it will not affect the review against this specific task and it may not be looked at by the evaluation team as the Government may not have the specific software to view it.**********
  
All proposals (to include completely filled in past performance reports) shall be e-mailed to the Contracting Officer Doug Punzel at Douglas.Punzel@gsa.gov (617-565-5769)AND Jim Fahey  at James.Fahey@gsa.gov(617-565-5170).

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to incorporate answers to questions received from potential offerors regarding this solicitation, extend the closing date of the combined synopsis/solicitation, implement a closing date for questions and provide clarification as to how prices will be evaluated.

Solicitation 200-2006-18431 is hereby amended as follows:  

?	Answers to questions received for this solicitation are hereby provided. (See below)

?	As a result of changes being made in this amendment, the due date for proposals is hereby extended from 10:00 AM August 29, 2006 to 10:00 AM September 5, 2006. 

?	Inquiries concerning the solicitation document should be submitted in writing to the issuing office.  Any additions, deletions, or changes to the solicitation will be made by an amendment. OFFERORS ARE INSTRUCTED SPECIFICALLY TO CONTACT ONLY THE SOLICITATION CONTRACTING OFFICE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ASPECT OF THIS REQUIREMENT PRIOR TO CONTRACT AWARD. PROPOSALS AND ALL CORRESPONDENCE RELATING TO THE SOLICITATION DOCUMENT SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICE. Inquiries should be received at the Contracting Office no later than 	Monday, August 21, 2006, and maybe submitted via e-mail to egz2@cdc.gov.

?	Weighted average unit price method of evaluation will be utilized to evaluate price.  Line items requesting range pricing will be determined utilizing the Weighted Average Unit Price method.  Those with single numeric quantity will be determined by multiplying the quantity with the offeror?s proposed unit price.  This means that a representative percentage will be calculated for each quantity of each drug.  Please note that all percentages will be rounded to the whole percentage and the HIGHEST quantity for each option range will be utilized.  For example, quantities of ****300, 600, and 900 equal a total quantity of 1,800.  The percentage for each quantity is 17%, 33%, and 50% respectively (take each quantity divided by the total quantity).  Then each percentage is multiplied by its respective proposed unit price.  This represents each quantities weighted unit price.  For example, if the unit prices were $5.00, $3.00, and $2.00, respectively, the weighted unit prices will be $.85, $.99, $1.00 respectively.  Please note that all weighted unit prices will be rounded to the whole penny.  The weighted unit price is then multiplied by its respective quantity rounded to the nearest dollar, to get the total price for each quantity.  All prices for all line items will then be added together to determine the total overall evaluated price.  This price will then be utilized to determine the offerors total evaluated price.

?	Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the the combined synopsis/solicitation 200-2006-184231, remains unchanged and in full force and effect.

*  THIS RESPONSE IS DUE BY 10:00 AM ON 29 AUGUST 2006 *

Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Procurement and Grants Office (Atlanta), 2920 Brandywine Road, Room 3000, Atlanta, GA, 30341-4146

       The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is seeking potential offerors who have the capabilities of procuring Opportunistic Infection Drugs (OI) and Home Based Care Drugs & Products within and for Vietnam; this is a Request for Quotation for providing these services and products.     The Government intends to award an Unpriced Firm Fixed-Price Purchase Order that will consist of a 6 month base period with four six month option period.     The offerors will be required to undertake the product procurement through an open quotation system.     The products are procured on open bid, with a minimum of three quotations required for each product.     The product with the lowest cost, which can meet all of the specifications and quality requirement, is then procured. Included in this description is a sample list of OI Drugs that may be required to be purchased under the purchase order.
       
       Each offeror MUST submit ALL required certifications showing proof of meeting the government's requirements with their quotation, which are listed here:

       *  Under Vietnam law and regulation only a registered and licensed pharmaceutical distributor may undertake physical distribution of pharmaceutical products. Additionally, PEPFAR Vietnam is currently operating in 40 provinces of Vietnam with a wide geographical range from the far Northern area to the far Southern area of the country; a longitudinal spread of around 2,000 Kms.     The contractor must be able to operate over a wide geographical range.  
       
       *  The volume of medicines to be provided by PEPFAR, although small in comparison to the total country requirement, is nevertheless a significant proportion in relation to the central level public sector supply. Therefore the contractor must currently have high capacity volume capabilities and have adequate capacity to store and undertake the physical distribution volumes of medicines required by PEPFAR Vietnam.

       *  Because a number of treatment sites have very low storage capacity for medicines, it is a requirement that the contractor store medicines and undertake frequent small deliveries to the treatment sites. Further, storage is required to hold emergency stocks and buffer stocks against possible unforeseen circumstances and erratic usage patterns.

       *  It is a Ministry of Health (MoH) requirement, {Extraordinary Letter No. 6036/QLD-CL Ministry of Health, Drug Administration of Vietnam, Attention: Pharmaceutical Companies, enterprises attaining Good Practices (GPs)} that all new operations, must use only storage facilities that have ASEAN (Association of South-East Asian Nations) GSP (Good Storage Practice) certification.

      *  It is a MoH and MoF requirement that all proposed medicine distribution must be approved in advance by both Ministries.

      *  All offerors who are to procure, store and distribute medicines destined for use within the public sector of Vietnam must have within their possession/on file specific approval for each activity from both the MoH and MoF.

      *  *  Although the purchase order will be unpriced, all offerors are required to submit current pricing information for all drugs listed below.  The requirement for current pricing information is for evaluation purposes.  However, prices submitted will be used to determine the acceptability and fair and reasonability of prices included in resultant invoices.  Those quotes that do not include pricing information will not be considered for award.  Please refer to the attachment of sample drugs when developing price quotations.  A price for each range listed shall be included.  If quoder the purchase order will be purchased with PEPFAR funds, therefore drugs purchased through the purchase order are being provided by PEPFAR.
 
7q. If medicines are provided by PEPFAR at no cost, how will the contractor be reimbursed for delivery expenses of these medicines?
7a. See question 6.

8q. The solicitation requires the submission of two things:  all permits & certificates and drug pricing & quotes.  Is there a guideline for the solicitation or at least a check list?
8a. No.
 
9q. Do we have to purchase all the drugs in the US?
