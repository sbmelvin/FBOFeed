<DESC>The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to modify an existing contract (68D02065) with Research Triangle Institute (RTI), Research Triangle Park, NC, which was awarded on a competitive basis.  The current option period expires September 30, 2007. It is essential that progress be uninterrupted on the quality assurance related projects.  The modification will extend the current period of performance through February 29, 2008. 

The Research Triangle Institute is responsible for implementation and operation of national, state/local, and tribal air monitoring networks that  addresses the quality of the measurement data of the criteria air pollutants (carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), sulfur dioxide (So2), and various sizes of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5)), chemical speciation of particulate matter, air toxic compounds, and ozone precursors required to be measured by the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) program in the development of national air pollution control emission standards.  

The projects include; support in the development and revision of QA guidance documentation; facilitation of assessments and audits; ambient air quality assurance program support, including outreach and training activities;  and precision and accuracy program support.  One of the critical elements RTI supplies under this contract is support to EPA?s Quality Assurance programs primarily for the FRM Network.  The key functions of quality assurance is the characterization, quantification and publication of uncertainty in existing PM2.5 measurements, and to inform regulatory and policy decisions made by Federal, State, local and Tribal air pollution control agencies.  

RTI is the database manager for the Performance Evaluation Database (PED) which includes all facets of programming for data review and correction, data storage, data transfer, data integration, data reporting and data upload to AQS for the performance evaluation laboratory located in Athens, GA.  RTI also provides support for on-site field and laboratory training which is scheduled for November 2007.  

Interruption or delay of services would cause harm to the Government not only in the PEP program, but to the PM2.5 mass monitoring network, which consist of approximately 1300  monitoring sites and is a critical component in the national implementation of the PM2.5 NAAQS.   Therefore, based on RTI's unique knowledge and experience, it  is believed that RTI is the only contractor that has the ability to continue the critical support to the EPA within the necessary time frame.  It is, therefore, in the Agency?s best interest to obtain the services of RTI on a sole source basis by extending the current period of performance of this contract for a period of 5 months for continuity of services.   The place of performance is at the contractor's site. 

Updated status to this synopsis may be viewed at http:www.epa.gov/oam/rtp_cmd.  It will be your responsibility to frequently check the same site for any subsequent  amendments.  Telephone and FAX requests will not be honored.  No Solicitation is available.  Hard copies, CDs or disketts are not available.   All interested parties who believe they can provide the required services should fully explain their capabilities in writing within 15days of the date of this announcement.

Description:  This power amplifier works with European systems in the 880-960 MHz and 1710-1880 MHz ranges, and in coordination with the TEX and DEX modules for active interrogation.

Though this notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, information received by the response date of this solicitation will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed purchase order based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. The NAICS code is 334220.

Sole Source Justification:

<DESC>1.	This specification establishes the functional, performance, design, fabrication, and inspection requirements for composite spacers including spacer/cuff seals, and disc/spacer interface bushings used in the Arnold Engineering Development Center?s (AEDC) wind tunnel 16T.  A total of 211 spacer assemblies, including seals and bushings (67 Row A spacers, 71 Row B spacers, and 73 Row C spacers) and 700 fastener bolts, nuts and washers shall be supplied in accordance with parameters set forth in this specification.  The C1 Compressor provides airflow for the 16T wind tunnel.  The C1 compressor accomplishes this through standard axial flow technology.  The compressor is a large three-stage axial flow machine with a rotor blade tip-to-tip diameter of 30.2 ft.  Each stage is composed of rotating blades separated by variable pitch stator blades. Composite spacers including spacer/cuff seals, and disc/spacer interface bushings are used to fill and fair-in the compressor hub between the compressor rotor blades at the blade root section, to limit the blade tangential motion and to restrict air flow in the hub region to ensure compressor efficiency.  These spacer assemblies are integral to the operation of the rotating blades.

2.	The procurement will be accomplished by the two-step sealed bidding method.  STEP ONE consists of this Request for Technical Proposals, submission of Technical Proposals by prospective contractors, evaluation of proposals by the Government, and, if necessary, discussions of proposals with bidders.  STEP TWO will consist of the Invitation for Bids, submission of bids, evaluation of bidder?s ability to perform the proposed contract and contract award.  STEP TWO will be restricted to those contractors who submitted technical proposals in STEP ONE and were determined to be acceptable either initially or as a result of discussions.  Bids in STEP TWO must be based on the bidder?s own technical proposal.

3.	This Request for Technical Proposals consists of the following:

	(a)  Attachment 1 ? Item Specification for AEDC Tunnel 16T C-1 Composite Compressor Spacers and Associated Hardware Revision B dated 23 April 2007 (17 pages and 20 drawings).

	(b)  Attachment 2 ? Technical Proposal Preparation Instructions (2 pages).

	(c)  Attachment 3 ? Technical Proposal Evaluation Criteria (2 pages).

	(d)  Attachment 4 ? Spacer Movie

4.	Technical Proposals shall be prepared in accordance with Attachment 2, Technical Proposal Preparation Instructions.

5.	Technical Proposals will be evaluated by the Government with the assistance of Technical Advisors employed by Aerospace Testing Alliance (ATA) in accordance with Attachment 3, Technical Proposal Evaluation Criteria.

6.	The submission of multiple technical proposals will be permitted in accordance with the following provision:

Multiple Technical Proposals (Apr 1984)
In the first step of this two-step acquisition, solicited sources are encouraged to submit multiple technical proposals presenting different basic approaches. Each technical proposal submitted will be separately evaluated and the submitter will be notified as to its acceptability.
7.	Technical Proposals SHALL NOT include prices or pricing information.

8.	One original and five copies of each technical proposal shall be furnished.  Technical proposals shall be addressed to:  USAF Procurement Branch, 	Contracting Division, 		 100 Kindel Drive, Suite A332, Arnold AFB TN  37389-1332, ATTN:  Mr. Tony Clayborne.  Technical Proposals must be received in Room A332, A&E Building, AEDC, on or before 2:00 P.M. (local time) on 22 August 2007.  Technical Proposals received after that time shall be considered late and shall be governed by the following provision:

Late Submissions, Modifications, Revisions and Withdrawals of Technical Proposals under Two-Step Sealed Bidding (Nov 1999)
(a) Bidders are responsible for submitting technical proposals, and any modifications or revisions, so as to reach the Government office designated in the request for technical proposals by the time specified in the invitation for bids (IFBs). If no time is specified in the IFB, the time for receipt is 4:30 p.m., local time, for the designated Government office on the date that bids or revisions are due.
(1)  Any technical proposal under step one of two-step sealed bidding, modification, revision, or withdrawal of such proposal received at the Government office designated in the request for technical proposals after the exact time specified for receipt will not be considered unless the Contracting Officer determines that accepting the late technical proposal would not unduly delay the acquisition; and?
(i) If it was transmitted through an electronic commerce method authorized by the request for technical proposals, it was received at the initial point of entry to the Government infrastructure not later than 5:00 p.m. one working day prior to the date specified for receipt of proposals; or
(ii) There is acceptable evidence to establish that it was received at the Government installation designated for receipt of offers and was under the Government?s control prior to the time set for receipt; or
(iii) It is the only proposal received ant it is negotiated under part 15 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.
(2) 	However, a late modification of an otherwise successful proposal that makes its terms more favorable to the Government will be considered at any time it is received and may be accepted.
(b) Acceptable evidence to establish the time of receipt at the Government installation includes the time/date stamp of that installation on the technical proposal wrapper, other documentary evidence of receipt maintained by the installation, or oral testimony or statements of Government personnel.
(c) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that technical proposals cannot be received at the Government office designated for receipt of technical proposals by the exact time specified in the request for technical proposals, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the request for technical proposals, the time specified for receipt of technical proposals will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the request for technical proposals on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume.
(d) Technical proposals may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of technical proposals. If the request for technical proposals authorizes facsimile technical proposals, they may be withdrawn via facsimile received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of proposals, subject to the conditions specified in the provision at 52.214-31, Facsimile Bids. A technical proposal may be withdrawn in person by a bidder or its authorized representative if, before the exact time set for receipt of technical proposals, the identity of the person requesting withdrawal is established and that person signs a receipt for the technical proposal.
9.	Bidders are advised to submit technical proposals which are fully and clearly acceptable without additional information or explanation.  The Government may make a final determination as to whether a technical proposal is acceptable solely on the basis of the technical proposal as submitted and may proceed with Step Two without requesting further information from any bidder.  However, the Government may at its sole discretion, request additional information about technical proposals which it determines reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable.  The additional information must clarify or supplement the original technical proposal, but not basically change it.  The Government may discuss any technical proposal with the bidder.
10.	Each bidder submitting an unacceptable technical proposal will be so notified upon completion of the technical evaluation of his proposal and final determination of such unacceptability.  Any technical proposal which fails to conform to the essential requirements of the specifications or this Request for Technical Proposals shall be considered nonresponsive and categorized as unacceptable.
11.	Bidders are advised that their technical proposals may include data which the bidder does not want disclosed or used for any purpose other than proposal evaluation.  In such case, the bidder shall mark the title page of the technical proposal with the following legend:
	?This data, furnished in connection with Request for Technical Proposals for AEDC Tunnel 16T C-1 Composite Compressor Spacers and Associated Hardware shall not be disclosed outside the Government and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other than to evaluate the technical proposal; provided, that if a contract is awarded to this bidder as a result of or in connection with the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the contract.  This restriction does not limit the Government?s right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.  The data subject to this restriction is contained in Sheets _______________.?
12.	For information, bidders are advised that evaluation of technical proposals will required approximately four weeks.  Within one week after evaluation is completed, Step Two will be issued.  Bidding time will be approximately two weeks.  It is anticipated that contract award will be made in late October or early November 2007.  The Government?s performance period will be contained in the Invitation for Bids issued under Step Two.
13.	If as a result of Step One a technical proposal is determined acceptable, a survey team may contact the bidder?s facility to determine their financial and technical ability to perform.  Current financial statements and other pertinent data should be available at that time.
14.	Any questions should be addressed to the undersigned at telephone no. (931) 454-3918 or by email at the following address:  tony.clayborne@arnold.af.mil.

<DESC>This notice informs interested parties that the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a sole source solicitation for Design Agent/Engineering Services and Production for the Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) system to Raytheon Company, Network Centric Systems, 1501 72nd Street North, St. Petersburg, FL 33710. CEC is a sensor netting system that significantly improves battle force anti-air warfare (AAW) capability by extracting and distributing sensor-derived information such that the superset of this data is available to all participating CEC units. CEC fuses the distributed data into a fire control quality, single, air track picture that significantly improves own unit track precision, consistency and continuity; expands detection ranges; and increases reaction time. CEC also improves battle force effectiveness by improving overall situational awareness and by enabling longer range, cooperative, multiple, or layered engagement strategies. The propo!  sed acquisition for Design Agent/Engineering Services is to provide technical and engineering support, training, supplies, overhaul, maintenance and repair, assemblies, Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) preparation and proofing, and facilities for the FY08 through FY12 period of performance. The proposed Production acquisition is for 100 fully tested and integrated systems for the U.S. Navy (AN-USG-2A and AN/USG-3A), U.S. Marine Corps (CEC/CTN), U.S. Army (CEC/CTN and CEC/JLENS), and Foreign Military Sales (FMS), and ancillary equipment for the FY08 through FY11 period of performance. Raytheon Company, Network Centric Systems has been awarded the design agent, follow-on development and production contracts on a sole source basis, under authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1) as they are the only known source containing the requisite knowledge to support the CEC program schedule without introducing unacceptable delays and incurring duplication of costs. A cost plus fixed fee cont!  ract will be placed on the Design Agent/Engineering Services contract.  The CEC Production contract will be awarded on a firm fixed price basis.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Sea-Bird Electronics Incorporated (SBE), 1808 136th Place NE, Bellevue, Washington for the acquisition of two (2) SBE 19-plus Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Optics-Ready Profilers (NAVOCEANO configuration).  The CTD systems being acquired are urgently needed to support mission essential operations aboard Navy military helicopters and ships supporting Mine Warfare (MIW) operations.  Because optical mine hunting systems are migrating to the fleet, the U. S. Navy has an immediate need to increase their optics/CTD sensor package deployments on military platforms.  These sensors provide data in support of other sensors used for oceanography, hydrography, ASW, home land security, MIW, Naval Special Warfare, and many other mission related tasks.  There are no other contractors other than Sea Bird that can provide a CTD that meets all of the U.S. Navy requirements.  Any ch!  anges to these requirements would adversely impact the mission of NAVOCEANO and our support to the MIW community.  Additionally, the U.S. Navy already has an enormous inventory of the same/similar Sea Bird sensors being purchased.  Changing vendors or instrumentation would call for a significant increase in funding to re-engineer current CTD/optics systems.  This would also require additional maintenance dollars and training programs to ensure data collection and database population.  Sea Bird has the required expertise to provide necessary calibrations and repairs to these COTS units.  Staying with COTS available instrumentation provides the greatest financial benefit for the government.  NAICS Code is 334519, FSC Code is 6030, SBA Size Standard is 500 employees.

Enclosed you will find a Statement of Work for Re-surfacing of System Furniture Services.  Please submit your price and technical proposal by September 13, 2007 at 4:00 p.m. (EST).

The selection process will consist of a Best Value source selection based on technical capability, organizational past performance, organizational experience, and price.  Under a Best Value source selection, non-price evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  However, EOUSA will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.   The Proposals shall include the following information:

If a Contractor will be using a subcontractor, up to three (3) references must be provided for the subcontractor as well.  References may be from commercial and federal/state Government contracts; however, similar support services performed for Federal Government customers generally will be considered more relevant than those done for commercial or state government customers.  The Government reserves the right to check other references not provided by the Contractor.  The following information is required for each reference:
		
			(A)  Customer name and address
		(B)  Point of contact (name, telephone number) for contractual/administrative matters and technical performance.
			(C)  Period of contract performance
			(D)  Description of work performed

<DESC>The AOC intends to engage a qualified general contractor to perform all work as necessary to retrofit two emergency egress stairs within the United States Capitol Building.  Both stairways will be on the west side of the Capitol; one new stair will be on the House wing and the other will be on the Senate side.  Both shall be executed concurrently as the work area is easily isolated from the occupied areas of the building.  The creation of these two new stairways involves shoring, demolition, underpinning, and the subsequent construction of the new structure(s).   The new stairs themselves will be cast-in-place concrete with painted aluminum hand and guardrails.  It will be necessary to introduce two new exit doorways into the west face of the existing building structure.   These egress doorways will require the modification of the Capitol's existing historic stone facade.  Also part of the project is the related mechanical, electrical, storm drain, sprinkler, drywall and related architectural work.  Due to security concerns, access to the work site is restricted and closely controlled by the AOC and the USCP.  The solicitation will be issued on or about October 15, 2007.  The due date for receipt of proposals will be on or about November 16, 2007.  The solicitation will be available electronically at http://www.aoc.gov/business/procure-opps.cfm on the date of issuance.  INTERESTED PARTIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO DOWNLOAD THE ELECTRONIC VERSION AS THIS WILL EXPEDITE RECEIPT OF THE SOLICITATION.  IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CONTRACTOR TO MONITOR THIS SITE FOR ALL CHANGES!!  The estimated magnitude of this project is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000.  Attendance at the site visit (date, time, etc. to be determined) is strongly encouraged!!

All firms wishing to submit a quote subsequent to the solicitation described herein MUST be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as well as the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) database or risk their otherwise-timely quotes being considered non-responsive regardless of its completeness, timeliness or other salient considerations.

Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101: An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official.  Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.  Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.  Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).  If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB, IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, e-mail: michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.  The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.  Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements.  Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

Please refer to the accompanying documents which consist of:

(iii)	Loan Program Description 

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) is seeking via a full and open competition, sources capable of providing contractual support for the modernization of the SBA Loan Management and Accounting System (LMAS). This includes implementing a new, fully integrated system utilizing a phased-in approach.  

SBA is conducting market research to gain an understanding of the capabilities and qualifications that exist in the marketplace as well as formulate a performance-based acquisition strategy.  This market research is the 2nd step of the 7-step performance-based acquisition methodology.  The SBA will also use this information as part of the competitive process to  identify the most viable sources as described in the advisory multi-step process of FAR 15.202.  Consistent with FAR 15.202, SBA shall evaluate all responses and shall advise each respondent either that it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor. SBA also will advise respondents not considered as viable competitors of the general basis for that opinion and, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.  In doing this evaluation, SBA will use criteria of overall assessment of proposed solutions to meet the stated objectives and experience of respondents in providing similar type loan management systems.  The SBA is utilizing the services of a contractor to assist it with this acquisition.

We would like your organization to complete the information requested on the attached questionnaire. Your response should be limited to 20 pages, including all attachments but excluding the cover page and table of contents, using one inch margins and a font size greater than or equal to Times New Roman 12.

This is considered Phase I of the Internet Protocol/Bandwidth Expansion (IP/BE) program.  The Naval Air Systems Command  intends to issue Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) and Firm Fixed Price (FFP) orders under Basic Ordering Agreement N00019-05-G-0026 with The Boeing Company on an other than full and open competitive basis to accomplish this effort.  MDS modifications include adding Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) capability to the Flight Management Computer (FMC) to support Automatic Dependent Surveillance via an International Maritime Satellite (INMARSAT) data link.  ADWS system modifications involve upgrading the Block 0 Ku receive system to the Next Generation Antenna (NGA) Connections by Boeing Ku transmit/receive system.  Additional modifications to the ADWS installed command management local area network hardware will be accomplished to allow full functionality of ADWS. The Boeing Company is the sole designer and developer of theE-6B Multifunction Display System (MDS) and Automatic Data Processing, Demand Assigned Multiple Access, and Weight Savings (ADWS) and therefore the only source possessing the proprietary data, expertise, equipment and personnel to design develop and incorporate these modifications into the E6-B aircraft.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Division of Cancer Control and population Sciences (DCCPS), Surveillance Research Program (SRP) plans to procure on a sole source basis with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to continue its activities Describing Trends in Treatment Usage by Tumor Characteristics and Risk Factors for Breast Cancer.

The Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) is a consortium of NCI-sponsored investigators whose focus is to use modeling to improve our understanding of the impact of cancer control interventions (e.g., prevention, screening treatment) on population trends in incidence and mortality.  These models are also used to project future trends, and to help determine optimal cancer control strategies.

Members of the breast cancer CISNET collaborative group are performing a joint analysis to project mortality into the future under various scenarios related to early detection, treatment and chemoprevention. This will represent a large modeling effort to look at changes in usage of mammography or introduction of new technologies for early detection of breast cancer.  Additional analyses include modeling benefits of chemotherapy, hormone therapy and use of new drugs such as Trastuzumab (Herceptin) as well as increased use of appropriate therapies in underserved populations.

In previous work, MD Anderson has defined categories of cancers to be considered in the analysis (based on ER status/HER-2 status/nodal status/age at diagnosis) and estimated the prevalence of cases in each of the defined categories.  They used clinical guidelines and recommendations to identify appropriate treatment for each category of breast cancer over time and the survival benefit for each treatment/combination of treatment. This previous work has provided the background needed to start modeling the effect of treatment advances over time.

The University of Texas M.D. Anderson is uniquely qualified to perform the work outlined in the statement of work. The program in Biomathematics and Biostatistics at M.D. Anderson trains researchers who will contribute to biomedical research by developing new methods for the design and analysis of research studies and by formulating mathematical models of biologic systems, thereby contributing to the understanding of cancer biology and disease processes.  M.D. Anderson was previously funded to work with the CISNET model groups to provide inputs to joint analyses to describe population trends in treatment and early detection. M.D. Anderson has the distinction of being a world leader in cancer modeling as well as treatment of breast cancer. The work described in this contract requites defining and tracking the usage of the latest treatments and risk factor trends for breast cancer to put together modeling inputs appropriate for various statistical approaches. The exceptional combination of expertise found at M.D. Anderson puts this institution in an inimitable position to perform the work described. Dr. Donald Berry will be responsible for overseeing the team of researchers at M.D. Anderson.  Dr. Berry, who has worked with the CISNET consortium for the previous 7 years, is currently an affiliate member of CISNET, and has a detailed understanding of the types of models involved in this effort with an exceptional understanding of the most current information available related to the breast cancer drugs of interest. Dr. Berry led the initial collaborative effort for the breast cancer CISNET group to estimate the impact of mammography screening and adjuvant therapy on breast cancer mortality that resulted in a recent publication in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Ravdin led the study that suggested a link between the decline in HRT use and a decline in breast cancer incidence in the SEER data set and will be taking the lead on the task of modeling the impact of HRT on breast cancer tumor growth. At MD Anderson, Dr. Berry and his staff collaborate with clinical trialist and oncologists that are major contributors to current breast cancer research. Dr. Berry has numerous publications in the area of design and interpretation of clinical trials related to breast cancer treatment and in modeling population impact of trial results. Dr. Berry and his staff are in the unique position of understanding the CISNET program at the most detailed level, possessing the skills and knowledge to perform population modeling relating to breast cancer treatment advances, and are experts in the area of breast cancer treatment trials. Therefore in the best interest of the government, this contract should be awarded to the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Oncogenomics Section, Pediatric Oncology Branch, plans to enter into a sole source procurement for Biotage Sp4 system  in support of the development of NanoBiosensors for the Detection of DNA, RNA, proteins and small organic molecules to identify cancer biomarkers and for the application of sensitive cancer diagnosis tools with Biotage, 1725 Discovery Drive, Charlottesville, VA 22911.  

The North Amercian Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 Employees. 

The supplies herein are being procured in accordance with FAR Part 12 with the authority to use simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.5.  
 
Biotage is the only source known to the NCI with a four channel medium pressure flash chromatographic system that uses the same platform and conforms to pre-established chromatographic methods and data for the detection, purification and analysis of monomers and small organic molecules on the Biotage Sp4 system.  The Biotage SP4 system comes also with a solid adsorbent that is suitable for highly polar and non polar compounds as a pre-packed column. It is important that there is consistency in results between this contract and the tripartite NanoBiosensor initiative with major participation of NCI/ATC, University of Maryland and NASA.  These efforts would partly involve preparations of novel oligo-nucleotides and peptide nucleic acids (PNA?s) that can be integrated to engineered carbon nanotubes (CNT) for detection of very low signals that otherwise could not be detected by traditional means. The detection of extremely low signals from DNA-DNA or DNA-PNA hybridization could lead to a novel approach in early detection of cancer and other genetic abnormalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). To this end, The synthesis of modified DNA or Peptides requires the preparation of starting materials at larger scale of up to ten grams of material. It is therefore important to get these starting materials in highest purity for subsequent synthesis of our target probes. The Biotage brand of flash chromatography system has been reliable system and gives reproducible results of purification both for normal phase and reverse phase purification.
This notice is not a request for competitive quotation. Biotage is the only source known to the NCI which will meet the research needs of the project in a manner consistent with ongoing initiatives.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Cables PE3062-12, PE3062-24, PE3062-36, PE3062-48, PE3062-60, PE3062-72, PE3062-120, PE3062-180, PE3062-300, PE3062-600 will allow radios and test equipment to be interc onnected. Various lengths were selected to maximize flexibility in setting up several laboratory arrangements. To assist in interconnection an assortment of adapters are needed to add to the versatility of the cables. Adapter PE9086 Type N elbow allows for  the hard wire of test equipment and will eliminate noise. Other adapters such as PE9006, PE9007, PE6016, PE9383, and PE9002 will simply augment the cables listed above and allow for extensions if necessary.  To facilitate the interconnection of radios the following attenuators are necessary to adequately protect test equipment and other radios from inadvertent high power transmissions. The attenuators selected are all 30 dB with Type N connecters and are liste d as, 25 Watt PE7017-030, 50 Watt PE7019-030, 100 Watt PE7021-030, and finally 300 Watt PE7031-030. The higher rated attenuators such as PE7031-030 will allow complete performance testing of radio power amplifier performance as several radio power amplifie rs produce over 20 watts of power and others produce over 100 watts of power. Power dividers will also be needed to perform the combination or interconnection of radios and test equipment. The PE2046 8 Way power divider and PE2045 4 way power divider will accomplish the cable interconnections necessary. Terminators will be needed to properly isolate a radio and test its operation without affecting any other radio or piece of test equipment. Attenuators PE6009 and PE6032 will accomplish this goal for low pow er radios while PE6042 and PE6106 will provide for high power radio scenarios.  It is anticipated that a Firm Fixed Price Contract  will be awarded on contract W15P7T-07-C-P452 on a sole source basis to Pasternack Enterprises, Airport Business Center, PO BOX 16759 Irvine, CA 92623 under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 23041(c)(1) Only One  Responsible Source, as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The U.S. Army Communications Electronics Command (CECOM) has established a Industry Business Opportunities Page (IBOP) website to allow electronic transmittal of Request for Proposals (RFPs) from CECOM to  Industry. All parties interested in doing business with CECOM are invited to access, operate, send and receive information from the Business Opportunity Page at https://abop.monmouth.army.mil. It is the offerors responsibility to monitor this site for re lease of the solicitation and any subsequent amendments or information.

IRM/OPS/MSO/EML has identified the StoneGate product as a key component of the Department's core firewall infrastructure on OpenNet.  The maintenance listed above is required to support the Departments mission critical operating enviornment and its data from harmful attacks and viruses.  The StoneGate licenses and hardware maintenance aids in the management of the Department's two-tier firewall infrasture.<BR><BR>

<RESPDATE>103107
<CONTACT>William Keller, 202.267.7386
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Air Traffic Organization, is requesting information from industry on seeking small business or small disadvantage business, qualified vendors to furnish 80 Medium Intensity Approach Lighting Systems (MALSR) with Remote Maintenance Monitoring Subsystem (RMMS).  The Lighting Systems Group (AJW-46) of the FAA's Navigation Services has forecasted the need of approximately 80 systems for near-term installations.  This procurement will allow the FAA to meet agency goals for the next four years. The intent of this procurement is to identify vendors who currently have a MALSR system that have been evaluated and tested in accordance with either FAA-E-2325e or FAA-E-2980 specifications.  Also, the vendors must have a RMMS systems that meet FAA-E-2750/1 and /4 specifications and comply with the requirement of FAA-O-6000.53.  Logistic support is a key economical factor. Thus, the vendor must have a MALSR system that is supportable with the FAA Logistic Center (FAALC) and has a training course at the FAA Academy.  The vendor must have the ability to start delivery of FAA-approved production units within one year of the contract award and not require design qualification testing to achieve FAA approval.  The vendor must also have the capability to deliver these systems at a rate of 20 systems per year. Only interested parties who can comply with and meet all requirements called out in this market survey should respond.  Vendors must submit a traceability matrix to FAA-E-2325e or FAA-E-2980, FAA-E-2750/1 and /4, design qualification test data, delivery lead times, and maximum production rates.  Any proprietary information should be so marked. Individual company responses will not be disclosed to other vendors. The Lighting Systems Group future plan is to transition to a more reliable MALSR system using Light Emitting Diodes (LED).  This procurement will allow a seamless transition from a traditional MALSR system to a LED based MALSR system.  AJW-46 is currently investigating a MALSR system redesign using LEDs and is planning a procurement of an LED based MALSR system in the future.   This announcement is NOT a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind. Further, the FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. All interested parties are advised that the FAA will NOT pay for any information or any administrative costs incurred that are associated with any response received from industry in response to the request for comments.  Therefore, any costs associated with and submissions from an interested party will be solely at the interested party's expense. Failure to respond to this request will not result in exclusion from any future competition. At this time, the nature of this competition has not been determined. In accordance with paragraph 3.2.1.2.1 of the FAA's Acquisition Management System (AMS), this market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition would exist if this acquisition were set aside for eligible small business or for eligible socially and economically disadvantaged business under the Small Business Administration's 8 (a) Program. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is projected to be 334511 with a size standard of 750 employees. Interested firms are asked to submit the attached Business Declaration form (attachment A) and a copy of the 8 (a) certification (if applicable).

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command.  This synopsis is being amended to provide notification that alternate methods of meeting the requirement for the UPS battery replacement will be considered in addition to the C&D Technologies Liberty 1000 Batteries, Model LS2-600. An award will be made to the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.  If you are quoting an alternate method, please provide sufficient documentation to use in determining if your method will satisfy the government’s requirement.  Any alternate method should includ!  e batteries close in size to the original for ease of installation (9.90 inches in height, 16.58 inches in length, and 6.84 inches in width) as well as insuring limited modification to the batteries’ housing.   For any proposed method, the UPS must maintain a 20 minute run time during outages so please provide a run time curve with your quote.  In addition, since installation will take longer than one day, UPS must be in working order at the end of each day for any proposed method.  The end user has requested that the batteries are not delivered ahead of time but come with the company at the time of installation.  The closing date has been extended to 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, 12 September 2007.

1.	Include the following Questions and Answers regarding this combined synopsis/solicitation: 

1) Roof penetrations. Need to know the inside ceiling height, clearance between perlins, roof pitch, does a warranty existing w/ a roofing company and what style of roof?

As stated in the SOW, this contract is to include a site survey to look the proposed location over as well as inspect the existing booth that needs to be removed.  That will be the opportunity to determine exactly what is involved in the installation.  Existing roof penetrations can probably be used as they already have a booth in place, and the fire sprinkler system requires removal and replacement.  No other pipes should require relocating by the vendor.

2) Will any items above the spray booth area require relocating? (water or gas pipes, duct or electrical?)

<DESC>The overall goal of this solicitation is to foster new developments in Science and Technology which may ultimately lead to future operational capabilities beyond those represented by current acquisition programs and requirements.  As such, it is anticipated that successful proposals would ultimately contribute to the scientific and technological underpinning from which future Marine Corps and Combating Terrorism warfighting requirements and capabilities may become possible.  By necessity, the Applied Research and Advanced Technology Development efforts are extremely technically diverse.  As such, efforts are divided into six Thrust Areas each representing operational functions critical to Expeditionary Warfare.  Brief descriptions of ongoing efforts within the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare thrust areas are posted at http://www.onr.navy.mil/sci_tech/30/.  Other references describing concepts for Marine Corps future warfighting include MC Strategy 21, Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare and the Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare Capability List, Science & Technology Strategic Plan, and Distributed Operations that can be found at https://www.mccdc.usmc.mil/.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)
Introduction
This publication constitutes a Request for Information notice and no formal Request for Proposals (RFP), solicitation, and/or additional information regarding this request will be issued.  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel & Readiness) will not issue paper copies of this request.

Recognizing that asymmetric warfare will be the most likely means that potential enemies will continue to employ in their efforts to challenge U.S. interests, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) (OUSD P&R) previously tasked the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) to study how the military should train to combat asymmetric threats.  IDA concluded that, because of the unpredictable nature of such threats, the military should emphasize the development of adaptive leaders, units, and commander/leader teams.  In a new follow-on study, OUSD P&R has requested that IDA provide support in the development of an adaptability training strategy.  As an initial part of that study, IDA will conduct an analysis of current adaptability training initiatives of the military Services, other government agencies, and private industry.

Definitions
To clarify what is meant by ?adaptability training,? a definition of adaptability is required. The IDA study agreed with a report by the Army Research Institute which defines adaptability as ?an effective change in response to an altered situation.?  Thus, when looked upon as a skill, adaptability can be understood as the ability to recognize an altered situation and to conceive and produce an effective response to that altered situation.  Adaptability, while considered a skill in itself, was further decomposed for the purposes of the IDA study as a function, first, of the cognitive skills of intuition and critical and creative thinking and, second, of the relational skills of self-awareness and of team social skills.
?	Intuition, as defined by Gary Klein, author of The Power of Intuition, is ?the way we translate our experience into action.?  Intuition is the process by which one recognizes how a given situation fits a particular pattern and makes corresponding decisions about how to react to that situation.  Studies have shown, with or without training, that is what leaders do.  
?	Critical and creative thinking are understood to be interrelated and complimentary aspects of thinking.  Critical thinking, a widely used term, has been simply defined by Air Force Colonel Michael Guillot as ?the ability to logically assess the quality of one?s thinking and the thinking of others to consistently arrive at greater understanding and achieve wise judgments.?  Creative thinking most often relates to innovation and requires imagination, originality, and flexibility.  Most education institutions advertise the development of critical thinking as a primary goal
?	Self-awareness relates to a realistic assessment of one?s own abilities that allows the individual to play to his or her strengths while remaining aware of his or her weaknesses.  Self-awareness includes an individual?s understanding of how he or she is perceived by others and contributes directly to one?s ability to work effectively with others and as part of a team.  
?	Team social skills are simply those skills that allow groups of individuals to work together effectively.  The Consortium for Research on Emotional Intelligence in Organizations has identified one representative sample of key social skills which adaptive leaders and leader teams require.  A number of those skills involve social awareness?a parallel to self awareness.  These include empathy?an understanding of and interest in the concerns of others, service orientation?a commitment to the needs of those being served, and organizational awareness?recognition of the key relationships and dynamics within the group.  Other social skills involve the ability to lead and manage within a group.  They include the ability to inspire others, to help others develop their own skills, to initiate and manage change, to manage conflict, to influence others to agree with a position or proposed action, and to build relationships that contribute to creating a shared vision and desire to work collaboratively.  

Purpose
The purpose of this REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) is to obtain information concerning existing training and education programs being employed in industry, academia, and other government agencies that are designed to develop and enhance adaptability skills and the four components thereof as defined above.

All information received will be provided to IDA for use in its assessment.

<SUBJECT>59 -- DC SERVO AMPLIFIER REDESIGN OR REPLACEMENT
<SOLNBR>NWSRFI0002KAR
<RESPDATE>100507
<ARCHDATE>10102007
<CONTACT>Kelly Rima, Purchasing Agent, Phone 303-497-3779, Fax 303-497-3163, Email Kelly.Rima@noaa.gov
<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. The National Weather Service (NWS) is conducting market research to identify various options for redesigning the DC Servo amplifier used in the WSR-88D Antenna Positioning System. The purpose of this RFI is to explore options for significantly modifying the existing Servo amplifier or a replacing it with a commercially available design modified to meet our specific requirements.  

The Servo Amplifier Unit is designed to provide bi-directional pulse width modulated (PWM) DC power to drive the pedestal azimuth and elevation DC motors.  It has a 200 Volt DC rated bus voltage and provides 30 Amps of continuous output and is current limited to 45 Amps max.  The Servo amp also receives a plus/minus 10VDC analog current command signal from the antenna pedestals DCU (Digital Control Unit).   The Servo amp then drives the DC motors at the requested current and direction. The Servo amp gain is 4.5 Amps/Volts so a 10VDC input would result in max drive current of 45 Amps. The Servo Amplifier unit is designed to be placed inside an amplifier cabinet that fits into a standard 19-inch-EIA-type rack on slide-type rails.  The dimensions of the current unit are 11" x 8" x 4".  Any proposed replacement must be approximately the same size and must be connectorized to be compatible with the current system implementation.

The Servo amplifier Unit provides DC power to the azimuth and elevation motors, which are an integral part of the antenna positioning control system.  The existing amplifier has three major components:  1) A Motor Driver Power section with 16 transistors, diodes, and base drive circuitry to drive every one of the transistors; 2) a Logic Power Supply board to create all +/- 15 V DC and auxiliary logic supplies; and 3) a Control board that receives external commands and regulates current in the amplifier based on the command. 

Currently, the DC Servo-Amplifier Design enclosure uses 1 DB5 and 1 DB25 connector to carry various signals and is 11inX.  The pin out of the current servo amplifier design is as follows:

J1 Power Connection (DB-5W5P)
Pin 1: + High Voltage DC Bus Input (Rated 200 VDC)
Pin 2: + High Voltage DC Bus Return
Pin 3: Chassis Ground
Pin 4: Motor Drive Current + Output (30A min, current limited to 45A max)
Pin 5: Motor Drive Current - Output (30A min, current limited to 45A max)

J2 Control Signals (DB-25P) Pins not listed are "Unused"
Pin 4: Current command + input (0-10 VDC)
Pin 5: Current command - input (0-10 VDC)
Pin 9: Over-current Fault Output to user (45A max, TTL set low for fault)
Pin 13: Chassis Ground
Pin 14: 15V return
Pin 20: Enable Input (TTL low inhibits drive)
Pin 21: Over-temp Fault Output to user (Vendor specified temp, TTL set low for fault)
Pin 22: Power Supply Fault Output to user (Vendor specified, TTL set low for fault)
Pin 24: +28V Power Supply Input (User Supplied)
Pin 25: -28V Power Supply Return (User Supplied)

The command signals applied to pins 4 and 5 of J2 come from the Digital Control Unit.  This differential input signal controls motor speed and direction of rotation. 

 A 10VDC command input relates to maximum current output to the servo motors.  This condition calls for max current and should be current limited to 45Amps under normal operation. 

The "Over-current Fault" condition is an open collector output (ref to a +15VDC return) and set low when the amp draws more than the maximum current of 45Amps under a short condition in the motor and/or amp and shuts down the amp. (Pin9). 

The "Over-temp Fault" condition is an open collector output (ref to a +-15VDC return) set low when the temperature sensors in the amplifier detects a temperature exceeding the vendor specified threshold and should shutdown the amp. The threshold currently is set for 60 degrees C. (Pin 21)

The "Power Supply Fault" condition is an open collector output (ref to a +-15VDC return) set low when any of the internal power supply circuitry within the power amplifier fails and should shutdown the amp. (Pin22). 

A fault condition on Pins 9, 21, or 22 inhibits the operation of the amplifier to prevent damage.

The user would like to have current monitoring capabilities in the servoamp and displayed on the front panel of the Poweramp cabinet on an LCD panel for both Azimuth and Elevation.  The user would like to explore options to monitor peak and RMS current values.

The NWS will not fund the wholesale development of a new design to support this requirement.  Responses to this market survey must include the device manufacturer, a product description with performance parameters, a statement regarding current availability, a statement describing any required modifications and interface requirements, and the estimated cost of the product including any required modifications.  This RFI does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotes. Should the results of this market research indicate feasibility of a High Energy semiconductor switch replacement with an existing commercial product; the NWS will consider retrofit options for its nationwide network of 175 Radars as a potential follow-on product improvement project.  All information should be submitted to the attention of Ms. Kelly Rima, U.S. Dept. of Commerce/NOAA/MRAD, Acquisition Division MC3, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305, fax: 303-497-3163, or e-mail Kelly.rima@noaa.gov  All responses should be received no later then October 5, 2007.  No telephone calls will be accepted or returned.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, NOAA, intends to solicit for purchase of  25 each  Anemometer, Totalizing, Standard 3-Cup, 0-100 MPH, Automatic Reset to Zero, Manually Reset, Self-Lubricating, Replaces F104F With Correction Factor of 0.96, Center of Cups Installed 6?- 8? Above Evaporation Pan Rim, Mounting Hardware F105-MP1, Novalynx Model 200-2510NC. The Totalizing Anemometer is used in the National Weather Service, Cooperative Weather Observing Program (COOP) Evaporation Station Pan. The general characteristics of the 3-cup anemometer are not necessarily unique, they automatically reset to zero and it must be self-lubricating.  There are two specific and unique design characteristics that require the sole source procurement of the Novalynx Model 200-2510NC.  Government climatologic data sets are now collected with a correction factor 0.96 (1) to accommodate the change in standard anemometer hardware. Additionally, the mounting hardware and repair parts (2) are now stocked at the National Logistics Support Center. A change in the baseline anemometer would require a change in the COOP data collection and recording process at the National Climatic Data Center and in the complete logistics support system for the anemometer. The following is a list of associated hardware that would require change at a considerable expense to the Government: 1) Mounting Hardware, NWS ASN: F105-MP1; 2) Acorn Nut, P/N: T920720, NWS ASN: F105-MP2; 3) Hex Nut, P/N T9200721, NWS ASN:  F105-MP3; 4) Cup Assembly, P/N: T920722, NWS ASN: F105-MP4; 5) Gear Train (MPH), P/N: T920753, NWS ASN: F105-MP5; 6) Upper Bearing, P/N: T920755, NWS ASN: F105-MP6; and Counter Assembly, P/N: T920758, NWS ASN: F105-MP7.  The Novalynx Model 200-2510NC was evaluated and tested at the Government?s expense to replace the F104, which was discontinued by the original manufacturer. At the time of the evaluation and selection the Novalynx Model 200-2510NC was the only mechanical-type anemometer with similar performance characteristic to the previously sole-sourced F104. The associated expense resulting from another product selection would result in costs that far out-weigh any market benefits or initial savings resulting from a competitive procurement.  This item is being purchased for the National Weather Service (NWS), to be delivered to the National Logistics Support Center, Kansas City, MO. The intended procurement is for supplies for which the Government intends to acquire from only one qualified source under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1).  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. The Government reserves the right to solicit bids based on the receipt of affirmative responses to this notice or issue an order to Novalynx Corporation, whichever is determined to be more advantageous to the Government without further notice. The anticipated award date shall be within 12 calendar days after the date of this publication. Interested firms should submit in writing, its name, address, point of contact, telephone number, business size and a brief statement regarding its capability to provide the specified equipment. Also include the name, telephone number, and point of contact for businesses or other Government agency to which it has previously provided the item. The information should be submitted by email to karen.l.christian@noaa.gov or send a fax request with an email address to telephone number 816-426-7530 ATTN: Karen Christian. Failure to provide the required information will deem your request non-responsive. The NAICS code for this action is 339999. This requirement is considered a 100% small business set-aside. All responsible sources may submit a quote which will be considered by the Agency. All contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) and Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA).

<DESC>The Portland VA Medical Center, Portland OR intends to negotiate a sole source procurement in accordance with FAR Part 13 with Compumedics USA, 7850 Pasco Del Norte, El Paso, TX 79912. This procurement is for the purchase of Compumedics Neuroscan 64-Channel Synamps II EEG/Evoked Potential System (Neuroscan EEG/ET 64).  The VA RR&amp;D Service-funded National Center for Rehabilitative Auditory Research (NCRAR) located at the Portland VAMC is the only auditory research and development center of its kind in the nation specifically dedicated to rehabilitation.  The NCRAR is leading the nation's efforts to discover new knowledge and develop useful technologies that optimize auditory rehabilitation services for hearing impaired veterans.  We must be able to directly relate research results obtained during previous lines of rehabilitative auditory research with ongoing and future lines of research when they are part of the same body of work.  This necessitates that equipment used for data collection, management, and analysis, are performed with identical variables.  Since we have previously purchased and used the Neuroscan 64-channel SynAmps II EEG/EP64, the additional system will be compatible with what is currently at the NCRAR.

<CONTACT>Robert Grados, Contract Specialist, (973)724-8718
<DESC>The Government is contemplating awarding a Purchase Order to Monarch  Lathes, L.P., Sidney, OH for a Monarch Toolmakerâ€™s Lathe, Model EE 10 x 20  and various optional machine accessories.  Personnel in the Engineering Group  need to design, fabricate, and test various parts for developmental  programs.  In order to continue work on these programs, specialized machining  is frequently required.  Procurement of a new Monarch lathe will provide for  compatibility with existing tools and accessories currently in use, will  provide engineers with the ability to continue prototype part production and  testing in an uninterrupted fashion, and will translate into a more efficient utilization of existing test facilities and reduced Government expenditures.  This will expedite time to solution and translate into more efficient  utilization of engineering resources resulting in considerable cost savings  to the Government.  In addition, no other manufacturer that we have been able  to locate manufactures a lathe with an AC motor as large and as powerful as  Monarch Lathes, L.P.  A more powerful motor is desirable because it  appreciably reduces the time it takes to make prototype parts resulting in additional cost savings to the Government.  FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(ii), only one  responsible source is applicable to this requirement; awarding this purchase  order to any other source would create substantial cost duplication and  unacceptable delays to the Government that is not expected to be recovered  through competition.  The procurement is for the acquisition of a Toolmakerâ€™s Lathe, 10 x 20, and optional machine accessories.  Interested sources should  submit their qualification data not later than 5:00 P.M. EDST on September  21, 2007 to JM&L LCMC Acquisition Center, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000,  ATTN: Robert M. Grados, email: robert.grados@us.army.mil, telephone: 973-724- 8718.

<SUBJECT>R -- Internet Audience Measurement
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) intends to procure internet audience measurement services on a sole source basis from comScore Networks, Inc.  The NAICS code is 514191 and the period of performance shall be for a period of one year from September 25, 2007 to September 24, 2008.  

In FY00, NLM contracted with PCDataOnline, Inc. for Internet audience measurement services.  The Internet audience measurement accounts, including NLM's, were bought by comScore Networks, Inc.  comScore Networks honored the PCDataOnline contract by providing netScore data for the duration of the contract.  Additionally, comScore took steps to reconcile the netScore data with the PCDataOnline data to assure a complete and continuous time series.  In FY01, FY02, FY03, FY04, FY05, and FY06, NLM selected comScore Networks to continue to provide the Internet audience measurement service with custom subdomain drill-downs
NLM staff determined that comScore Networks Inc. is uniquely qualified to  maintain continuity with the earlier PCData and netScore time series data, offer the necessary flexibility in meeting NLM's needs for custom analyses and drill down data, and provide by far the most complete coverage of the domestic (home, school, work) and international user segments based on the largest panel size and thus offering a basis for more comprehensive and accurate usage estimates.   

 BACKGROUND INFORMATION:

The Internet and World Wide Web (WWW or web) now play a dominant role in dissemination of NLM information services.

The immediate priorities of the Web Evaluation Project include: a) quantitative and qualitative metrics of web usage; b) measures of customer perception and use of NLM web sites; and c) monitoring of the quality of Internet connections by which users access NLM information services.  The Web Evaluation Project is pursuing an integrated approach intended to encourage exchange of information and learning within NLM, and help better inform NLM management decision-making on web site research, development, and implementation.

<SUBJECT>B--Notice of Intent to Award - Report on fire and debris flow history on the Sawtooth National Recreation Area to Boise State University
<DESC>Notice of Intent - This requirement is for follow on to existing requirement with Boise State University, 1910 University Drive, Boise, Idaho 83725-1247 to furnish report on past records of fire and disturbance for the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, Sawtooth National Forest. The objective of this research project is to reconstruct records of fire and disturbance within lodgepole pine-dominated forests of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA).  The proposed study is intended to provide preliminary data for natural resource managers, and to provide data for further work.  Disturbance histories in these forests will be developed using three methods:  1) establishing the ages of even-aged stands of trees through tree-coring and aerial photo mapping; 2) dating of past fires using charcoal from past fires preserved in alluvial fans; and 3) comparing fire data to a data set of insect infestation to gain an understanding of the interactions between fire and insect infestations in the Sawtooth region.  This proposed work will provide preliminary data on; 1) the history of stand-replacing disturbance for even-aged stands lodgepole pine forests in the Sawtooth National Forest, and 2) a pre-settlement record of fire-related sedimentation events in Fourth of July Creek and adjacent drainages derived from alluvial fan records.  The product of this work will be a preliminary stand age reconstruction and fire history reconstruction for lodgepole pine forests in the SNRA.  This data will help address the question of whether or not large fires such as the Valley Road fire are truly exceptional in the Sawtooth area, and will provide an indication of the return interval of stand-replacing disturbance.  This data will help inform management of fuel accumulations and inform planning for future disturbance in the forest.   This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals.  This determination of the Government not to open subject requirement to full and open competition was made IAW FAR 6.302-1.  No offers received in response to this notice, but offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing
<DESC>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL, A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.  The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Division of Extramural Research Activities (DERA) for the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Prairie Technologies Inc., 3030 Laura Lane, Suite 140, P.O. Box 620677, Middleton, WI. 53562-0677, for one (1) each, 444 nm custom upgrade diode laser system.  

This new system shall be compatible and fit into the Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) 458 nm confocal launch system, which is attached to an Olympus-X81 TIRF microscope.  The new system will increase excitation of CFP, as well as increasing the spectral separation between CFP and YFP for FRET analysis via TIRF.

The new system shall include the following: 1) ~440 nm diode laser ~ 40 mW, 2) ND filter wheel with ND 1 & ND 2 filters, 3) Mirror assemblies, 4) Dichroic assembly, 5) Custom EPROM for AOTF controller, 6) Adapter plate for diode laser, 7) Design and testing of upgrade components, 8) On-site modification of launch to upgraded design and 9) installation.

Due to the compatibility of the system, only Prairie Technologies is available for the government to meet their mission.

<SUBJECT>--NASHVILLE TENNESSEE HOCKEY CLUB ADVERTISEMENT PACKAGE
<DESC>Notice of intent to award a sole source purchase order to Nashville Hockey Club. This company's physical address is 501 Broadway, Nashville, Tennessee, 37203-3932. The award will be made for the purchase of a signage package advertising the Tennessee  Army National Guard. This marketing effort will concentrate on marketing activities with the Predators professional hockey team during the 2007-2008 hockey season. This procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 6.302-1, for Other than Full and Open Co mpetition and FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.. All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to USPFO for Tennessee Contracting Division Attn: John W. Anders, PO Box 41502 Nashville, or sent by email to john.anders@ng.army.mil Telephone requests or inquir ies will not be accepted. Responses to this notice must be submitted by 3:30 PM CST, Friday, September 7, 2007. A determination not to compete this requirement is within the discretion of the Government. Any response to this notice must show clear and conv incing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government in future procurements.  The point of contact for this announcement is John W. Anders, Contracting Specialist, at john.anders@ng.army.mil.                                       SUBJECT:  Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition        1.	This request for justification for other than full and open competition is for an on-site advertising package for the Nashville Predators 2007-2008 Hockey Season.  The recommended vendor to fulfill this requirement is the company of, Nashville Predators , LLC.    The Tennessee Army National Guard would like to use this company to market them during the home games for the 2007-2008 hockey season.  This kind of concept for this particular venue is not otherwise available to the Government. 2.	In an effort to increase the number of people enlisting in the  Tennessee National Army Guard (TNARNG) on a game day representatives from the TNARNG shall be allowed to set up a Game Day display in order to educate spectators about the opportunities ava ilable in the Tennessee Army National Guard  3.	The total estimated value of this advertising package shall not exceed $44,750.00. 4.	The Statutory Authority as noted in the Federal Acquisition Regulation part 6.302-1 is satisfied based on the fact that there is only one responsible source for fulfilling this requirement in the vicinity of Nashville, Tennessee, and that there are no o ther supplies or services that will satisfy the agency requirements for this particular requirement.  5.	The Nashville Predators is the only professional hockey team in Tennessee, and is the only sports organization in the area with the potential to provide an advertising media capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the Tennessee Army National Guard wishes to recruit.  6.	Efforts to solicit other contractors have not been made as the Nashville Predators is the only professional hockey team in Tennessee for this particular venue capable of reaching the desired number of people in the demographic group that the Tennessee A rmy National Guard wishes to recruit. 7.	The anticipated cost of this acquisition is determined fair and reasonable by comparison of prices proposed in other advertisement packages of this nature. The price proposed for the advertisement and marketing efforts with Vanderbilt University is $44, 750.00.  8.	Efforts were made to identify other sources of competition by searching for vendors registered under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 711211 for Display Advertising in Tennessee. No other hockey teams in the Middle Tenne ssee area were identified in this search that could provide an advertisement package as required for this particular requirement except for the Nashville Predators organization. 9.	The Nashville Pr edators, LLC, is the only responsible professional hockey source identified in the market research that could provide an advertising package of this type in the Middle Tennessee area.  10.	Based upon the market research conducted by this office there were no other sources that could have expressed an interest in this acquisition. 11.	No actions to remove barriers to competition will be taken, as the Nashville Predators organization is the only professional hockey organization in Tennessee who can provide advertising to potentially reach the desired number of people in the demograph ic group for potential recruits into the Tennessee Army National Guard. 12.	This justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Any firm that believes it can provide the stated capability within the established timeframe is invited to submit written notification to the Contrac ting Officer within ten calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.

NAICS code: 238330, Size $11.5M
Magnitude:  Between $25,000.00 and $50,000.00
This requirement is for a Sprung floor replacement which requires knowledge in Sprung Flooring.
Contact William L. Tomson, Contract Admin, 402-294-2248 for additional questions/ information.

STATEMENT OF WORK FOR NEW AEROBIC FLOOR

Job site:  Offutt Field House, Bldg 321 Offutt AFB, NE  68113

Scope of work:  Area aprox 53? 5? by 45? 10?.  Install a 6-mil vapor barrier over the concrete slab.  A layer of ?? CDX Plywood with thirty two ?? rubber pads will be laid loose over the floor.  A second layer of ?? CDX Plywood will be nailed to the first layer.  25/32? x 2 ?? 2nd and better Northern Hard Maple will be nailed to the plywood.  Each board factory finished with 5 coats of UV cured Lacquer.  Vented rubber bases will be installed at the walls and angled aluminum floor plates will be installed at the 4 doors with a gradual slope.

Contractor will ensure there is a smooth transition in and out of rooms to exiting hallway floors.

Contractor will ensure area is clean and free of debris, dirt and materials upon completion of work.  Any damage to the room or areas leading into this room caused by the contractor shall be repaired per the original finish.

The floor must consist of a hardwood sprung floor which meets the criteria outlined below in DIN standards.  Please note the reference made under protective function which is the requirement for aerobic floor systems.

Floor must have a minimum of five (5) coats of pre-finish.

Contractor will be responsible for replacement of cove base in the room as well.

Contractor will furnish signage and cordon off the area by the door to prevent people access to the area during construction.

Hours of work are between 0700 and 1700 Monday thru Friday.

Contractor and workers will be required to apply for a contractors work badge.

	The floor should be covered with a sleeper system and a hardwood surface.  Maple tongue and groove and pressure treated beech are the recommended requirements for aerobic court surface.  Court must adhere and meet DIN standards (Deutsches Intitut fur Normung).  These standards require that a floor meet six criteria:

1.	Shock absorption-a floor?s ability to reduce the impact of contact with the floor surface.  The greater the shock absorption, the more protective it is because it reduces impact forces.  An aerobics floor, for example, would need more shock absorption than a basketball court.

2.	Standard vertical deformation- the actual vertical deflection of the floor upon impact.  The greater the deformation, the more the floor deflects downward.  Floors with minimal deformation are not good at absorbing impact forces.

3.	Deflective indention- the actual vertical deflection of the floor at a distance 50 cm from the point of impact.  The greater the indentation, the more likely impact at one spot will cause deflection at a distant point.

4.	Sliding characteristics- the surface friction of the finished floor.  A floor with poor sliding characteristics would be inappropriate for aerobics or basketball.

5.	Ball reflection- (game action response) the response of a ball dropped on the floor compared to a ball dropped on the concrete.

6.	Rolling Load- a floor?s ability to withstand heavy weight without breaking or sustaining permanent damage.

The DIN criteria are then used sto evaluate the effectiveness of a floor.  A floor will have one of three functions:

1.	Sports function- a floor that serves a sport function enhances athletic performance.  Surface friction and ball reflection are important here.
2.	Protective function- a floor that serves a protective function reduces the risk of injury (e.g. from a fall) during activity.  Shock absorption is important here.
3.	Material technical function ? a floor that serves a material ? technical function meets the sports and protective functions.

In a health/fitness facility, the gymnasium and multipurpose floors are classified under sports function or material technical function.  The aerobics floor is classified under the protective function, with some sports function characteristics.

Contractor shall provide the following floor surface that has a material technical function for Aerobic workout to meet the following DIN criteria:

Shock absorption				53% minimum
Standard vertical deformation			2.3 mm minimum
Deflective indentation				15% maximum
Sliding characteristics				0.5 to 0.7 range
Ball deflection					90% minimum
Rolling load					337.6 lb

Submittals Required

Flooring Material 		Specifications and sample	3ea
Ramp detail			Drawing of installation	3ea
Schedule			Progress schedule		3ea

Pre-manufactured materials and sprung floor systems will be evaluated by Civil Engineerting/User personnel for acceptability for use to meet the above requirements.

Review & Confirm:  Each site that meets client content thresholds (as determined by the contractor?s scoring algorithms) will be analyzed by the contractor to confirm such content meets client criteria. 

Action & Report:  The confirmed violations and websites will be presented to FDA in a protected and unique portal.  The FDA shall have the ability to manage each record, add website specific data, and use tools to assist in management of the targeted content violation. 

Monitor & Review:  After the Known Universe has been established, the contractor shall use technology to examine each page and additional merchants for changes and mal-content on at least a monthly basis.  When changes are detected, the contractor shall determine and confirm if the changes are relevant and forward them to FDA. 
Evaluation would be best done by the bidders submitting a sample work product.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held? 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
    (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

(End of provision) 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS. It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open  and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

SOLE SOURCE REQUIREMENT: The Aircraft Repair & Supply Center (ARSC) performs depot-level repair, modification, Progressive Structural Inspection (PSI) of Coast Guard aircraft, systems, and components.  In support of these efforts, ARSC requires a number of electric tow tractors, which are being replaced with new Tug Technologies tow tractors.  The tractors require charging equipment to recharge the on-board battery.   For optimum tractor performance, the tractor original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommended and approved the Ametek charger.  The USCG is currently using this charger with satisfactory results and maintaining consistency in equipment type would be advantageous to the government. The charger works in concert with the Battery Identification Device (BID) that is installed on the DEKA 80 volt battery installed in the MX4 electric tow tractor during manufacture.  The charger and the BID work together to identify the battery being charged, maintains a charging record, identifies each charge cycle to a specific battery, automatically monitors battery temperature during charge to adjust the charging voltage to maximize battery life (opportunity charging) and charges 20% charged batteries up to 80% charge in 3 hours or less (essential at Air Stations where equipment must be ready 24/7/365) to respond to Search And Rescue (SAR) cases, and other emergencies.

<CONTACT>Theresa M. Velasquez Contracting Officer 3032313937     theresa.velasquez.mms.gov;
<DESC>Solicitation No. M07RQ14670 Request for Quotation Closing Date 09/21/2007.  This is a combined synopsis/soliciation for commerical items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solication will not be issued.  This soliciation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisiton Circular FAC 2005-19.  This acquisition is set aside for small business.  The NAICS Code is 541519.  The size standard of 18.0 million.  The Minerals Revenue Management (MRM) Freedom of Information Act Office is looking for a commercial off the shelf (COTS) FOIA specific database to support the FOIA process with tracking functionality and document management system.  Period of Performance:  One year support and maintenance, user and administrator training minimum 5 licenses, up to 20 if no additional charge. Current System: The FOIA team currently uses a password protected Access database which contains tables, fields and reports.  The Reports menu includes workload, open bills, closed bills, all FOIA requests, closed FOIA requests, open FOIA requests.  The input sections include a Summary page, a phone/contact log, Distribution log (DODL-which is used to track time), and Bill for Collection (report created from the DODLs). Service Needed: The FOIA Access database needs to be replaced with a new system.   The FOIA Access database keeps track of current and historical data.  It is difficult to maintain, and reports are difficult to create and run.   MRM must comply with the requirements of Executive Order 13392 "Improving Agency Disclosure of Information."  According to the EO, staff must be able to provide the status of a FOIA at all times.  The FOIA office must also provide reports for the A-76 requirements.  The FOIA office uses multiple systems to create reports. The FOIA workload has increased significantly over the previous several fiscal years.  A new system would save time and help organize the FOIA process making it more efficient and effective. The MRM FOIA Office needs a new system which will include the following: Create adhoc and standard reports in one place, identifying the status of a FOIA request at all times, with including updates and clarifications. Align with the EFOIA amendments of 1996 regarding electronic records management.  The EFOIA requires that frequently requested documents be published to an electronic reading room. Be electronically searchable.  This would save time and will eliminate duplicate work.  The FOIA staff currently performs manual searches of the FOIA Access database to identify whether a request for information is similar to a previous request.    Organize all FOIA documents in one place for easy storage and access.  The current process of organizing documents through Viewstar to prepare for publishing and redaction is cumbersome and disorganized.  This process needs to be streamlined.   Track contacts made during the process of responding to a FOIA request.  The current practice of storing emails and phone contacts in three different places (MRMFOIA mailbox, ERooms, and MRM FOIA Access database) is confusing and disorganized.  It is hard to keep track of changes and updates made to requests. Allow the program offices to electronically report their time spent searching and/or reviewing responsive documents.  The current process of providing division logs via email takes too much storage space on the email server; additionally, the divisions have asked the FOIA office for an automated fill-in form.   Allow updates when the DOI FOIA rates change.  The administrator currently does this manually.  This process needs to be automated and the FOIA office needs to be able to do this with or without administrator assistance. Better organize the electronic and paper workflow all in one location.  The MRM FOIA Office currently stores electronic documents, FOIA letter templates, draft final letters and other administrative documents on a common drive.  It is difficult to keep the information organized and often there are duplicate documents in duplicate areas.  Another problem is inconsistency as documents are saved in electronic and paper formats in different locations.   Provide EMC Documentum electronic records functionality, or provide an automated migration path to EMC Documentum Records Manager.   Requirements - New System  I.

All quotes shall include price(s), FOB point, a point of contact, name and phone number, GSA contract number if applicable, business size, and payment terms. Quotes over 10 pages in total will not be accepted by facsimile.  Each response must clearly indicate the capability of the quoter to meet all specifications and requirements.

The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms. Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed.

The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoter?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION NOTICE.   This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with the format of FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.   This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.    

The reference number NHLBI-PB(HL)-2007-237-DDC. 

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular  2005-18. 

This requirement is being conducted as a full and open competitive, with no set aside restrictions. The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) applicable to this requirement is 334513 and the associated small business size is 500 employees.

The Government?s estimated expected delivery date is sixty calendar days after receipt of the purchase order.

Market Research conducted by the Government has determined that the equipment can be provided only by GE Analytical Instrument.

The delivery point is the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Vascular Medicine Branch (VMB), Bethesda, Maryland.

The Government?s estimated expected delivery date is sixty (60) calendar days after receipt of the purchase order. 


This acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-18.  The total contracted dollar amount, including options will not exceed $5 million.  

Market research conducted by the Government has determined that the Nitric Oxide Analyzer (NOA) is manufactured in sufficient quantities by at least two (2) manufacturers which confirm the commercial market.

The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisition (OA), for the NHLBI, Vascular Medicine Branch, intend to award a single, fixed priced purchase order for the purchase of an Nitric Oxide Analyzer.    

The specifications of NOA are as follows: (1) modular unit that can be used to analyze nitrite concentration with the use of a chemiluminescence system (2) must be an extremely precise system, accurate down to nM concentrations of nitrite.  

In order to provide accurate and consistent results, the NOA must have: (1) the analyzer itself; (2) a circulating water bath; (3) a vacuum and all the requisite tubing; (4) applicable system software; (5) purge vessels allowing for the injection of different sample volumes; (6) and a NaOH trap.

Our lab uses the NOA to analyze the concentration of nitrite and nitrate. The primary objective in most of our research relates to the nitrite concentrations in whole blood and plasma and other bodily fluids from humans and animals. Our subjects may be on different nitrate and nitrite diets or are given nitrite derivatives as a type of medication. We then observe the resultant concentrations of the NO2. Many physiological and chemical effects have been found once NO2 has been added and we and many labs throughout the medical and scientific community are finding new properties of nitrite and nitrate.

Brand name justification; 1. Requiring Authority: 60 MDSS/SGSIR.  2. Contracting Activity: 60 Contracting Squadron.  3. Purchase Request Number: F3Z4537226A001.  4. Description of Requirement: 3 XTS4000 land mobile radios and necessary hardware and software required for them to be compatible with the Travis AFB Trunked Land Mobile Radio TLMR system.  5. Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition: Section 4202 of the Clinger Cohen Act of 1996 as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one brand name if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available to satisfy the agency requirement.  6. Justification or Authority for action: Motorola Inc is the brand that can satisfy the Governments requirement for compatibility with the existing system on base.  End user needs encrypted LMR systems, consisting of the proposed Motorola equipment, in order to be program compatible with existing base trunking system.  Without these radios the end users will not be able to access base trunking system and communicate with each other, their work control centers, and the rest of the base.

Market Research: The only other manufacturer of radios capable of operating on the TLMR system are manufactured by EF Johnson however they are not technically capable of meeting this requirement.  8. Brand Name: Motorola Inc.  9. Steps to improve competition: Market research will continue to be conducted.  Until other vendors produce equipment meeting NSAs policy guidance, Motorola Inc, is a brand name provider of this equipment for this requirement.

BRAND NAME SOURCE JUSTIFICATION

September 6, 2007

1. Requiring Activity:  AFCESA/CEMIRT OL-A
Gary Campbell, Powered Support Systems Supervisor

2. Contracting Agency: 60th Contracting Squadron, Travis AFB CA

3. Purchase Request #: F3ZT897208A002

4. Description of requirement: Purchase Caterpillar diesel parts for a 3512 Caterpillar engine with an arrangement number of 24Z00780

5. Statutory Authority permitting other than full and open competition:  Section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by: FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement.  This can be full and open competition for providing the identified parts listed in the contract.

6. Justification or Authority for action: 
a. These items will be utilized for an emergency power plant upgrade project at Andersen AFB, Guam. These items directly replace existing Caterpillar parts of the same part numbers that interface with an arrangement number of 24Z00780 specific to the manufacturer Caterpillar.  

b. CEMIRT is not aware of any competitive brands that may be substituted to meet this requirement and will question the validity of their specifications. 

c. If these specific parts are not ordered the engine can not be properly overhauled and could result in engine damage or destroy the engine totally.

7. Market Survey/Other facts:  A market survey was not performed as Caterpillar is the only manufacturer of the proper equipment to interface with the existing components without totally replacing the entire system, making it cost prohibitive for the Government.                                            

8. Sole Source Company: Any authorized Caterpillar distributor.

9. Steps to improve competition:  As long as repairs are being made to Caterpillar equipment only the OEM parts will continue to be ordered.  

10. Certification:  I hereby certify that the above information is complete and accurate.

The course will help in building an NCBO internal coaching program by increasing the understanding of the power of coaching.  Participants will receive one-on-one coaching and learn the value of such support in addressing their individual development needs as well as establishing better working relationships with others.  Each class session will include a ?working group? session that focuses on real NCBO working situations that participants bring.  This applied discussion will be the basis for additional networking and forming of a community of managers as coaches.  Tasks:  The program will be comprised of two, 2-day sessions.  The second session will follow the first session after approximately 45 days in order to allow participants to practice new concepts, self-observe, reflect on learnings, and identify challenges/questions for additional training and coaching. Course time will involve a combination of lecture, learning activities, and practice sessions. Classses will be presented by 2-3 different instructors who will each bring a unique perspective and experience to the classroom.  Pragmatics, discovery, and engaged learning will be emphasized in this program.  The course work and application will be provided onsite at the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office in Annapolis, Maryland.  Following the initial class, participants will be required to identify an employee or situation that will be the focus of the manager's effort to develop and apply his or her coaching skills.  Each class will also include time in a small Work Group of 5 or 6 participants. The Work Group will be led by an experienced coach and will allow participants to dialogue, consult to each other, and create approaches to resolve specific business concerns or problems. Each participant will also receive 2 hours of individual coaching provided by the Work Group coach.  Deliverables:  The contractor shall provide the following: 1) Full Proposal to conduct course as outlined above; 2) Initial meeting with NCBO Director to complete framework and timing of training for program managers; 3) Training and coaching support for program managers; and 4) Follow-up/debrief on training/coaching support.

     (4) The term "date of delivery" means the date product is received on a truck-by-truck basis.
     (5) The term "calendar week" means a consecutive seven-day period, beginning with whichever day of the week is specified in (c) below.
(c) ADJUSTMENTS.  The Contracting Officer shall issue a modification to the contract to reflect any price change pursuant to this clause.  The contract price shall be modified at three month periods after the date of award.  The contract price will not be modified during the three month period unless the market price increases or decreases by 10% or more of the current contract price.  Delivery Orders will be issued monthly at the adjusted contract price.  The unit price for individual delivery orders will not be adjusted.  
     (1) DAY OF PUBLICATION.  The market price in effect on the date  of adjustment shall be that item's preselected market price that is published on the Monday of the calendar week in which the adjustment is made, or, in the event there is no publication in that week, it shall be the item's preselected market price as last previously published.  
     (2) CALCULATIONS.  The prices payable hereunder shall be determined by adding to the award price the same number of cents, or fraction thereof that the market price increases or decreases, per like unit of measure.  All arithmetical calculations, including the final adjusted unit price shall be carried to four decimal places, not rounded.  
 	(i) If averages are published within a given publication, then these averages will be used. 
         (ii) If averages are not available within a given publication, manually calculated averages, will be used.
     (3) REVISION OF PUBLISHED MARKET PRICE.  In the event--
          (i) Any applicable market price is discontinued or its method of derivation is altered substantially; or 
          (ii) The Contracting Officer determines that the market price indicator consistently and substantially failed to reflect market conditions--the parties shall mutually agree upon an appropriate and comparable substitute for determining the price adjustments hereunder.  The contract shall be modified to reflect such substitute effective on the date the indicator was discontinued, altered, or began to consistently and substantially fail to reflect market conditions. If the parties fail to agree on an appropriate substitute, the matter shall be resolved in accordance with the Disputes clause of the contract.
     (4) FAILURE TO DELIVER.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this clause, no upward adjustment shall apply to product scheduled under the contract to be delivered before the effective date of the adjustment, unless the Contractor's failure to deliver according to the delivery schedule results from causes beyond the Contractor's control and without its fault or negligence, within the meaning of the clause Default of this contract, in which case the contract shall be amended to make an equitable extension of the delivery schedule.
     (5) UPWARD CEILING ON ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT.  The Contractor agrees that the total increase in any contract unit price pursuant to these economic price adjustment provisions shall not exceed 55 percent of the award price in any applicable program year (whether a single year or a multiyear program), except as provided hereafter.
          (i) If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that within the near future a price adjustment under the provisions of this clause will be required that will exceed the current contract ceiling price for any item, the Contractor shall promptly notify the Contracting Officer in writing of the expected increase.  The notification shall include a revised ceiling the Contractor believes is sufficient to permit completion of remaining contract performance, along with appropriate explanation and documentation as required by the Contracting Officer.
          (ii) If an actual increase in the established catalog price would raise a contract unit price for an item above the current ceiling, the Contractor shall have no obligation under this contract to fill pending or future orders for such item, as of the effective date of the increase, until the Contracting Officer issues either a contract modification to raise the ceiling or written notification that the ceiling will not be raised.
(d) EXAMINATION OF RECORDS.  The Contractor agrees that the Contracting Officer or designated representatives shall have the right to examine the Contractor's books, records, documents, or other data the Contracting Officer deems necessary to verify Contractor adherence to the provisions of this clause.
(e) FINAL INVOICE.  The Contractor shall include a statement on the final invoice that the amounts invoiced hereunder have applied all decreases required by this clause.
(f) PUBLICATIONS:  The following publication(s) is (are) used: BPN's Weekly Propane Newsletter This does not indicate a mandatory source of supply or area where bidders must obtain supplies.                       (End of clause)

To be eligible for award offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration database.

This announcement hereby announces the request for quote for the required items under a new RFQ V218537241CT99; a subsequent solicitation document will not be issued.

Reference RFQ V218537241CT99 on your proposal. [FSC= 7220].  Numbered Notes; Number 1, the proposed contract is 100% set aside for small business concerns. NAICS 238330 ($12.0M).
The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this solicitation and are incorporated by reference: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items (JAN 2004), 52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (JAN 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.   Contracting Officer shall consider the following in regards to evaluation iaw FAR Part 13; Past Performance and Price, with past performance being somewhat more important than price. (1)  Past Performance Evaluation Standards: The offeror shall demonstrate Past Performance through completion of similar U.S. Navy contracts for same or similar installations.  The Contracting Officer may consider past performance experience with contracts that cover numerous other types of marine decking installation contracts.  Data submitted by the offeror other than relevant contracts may not be considered.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.  Failure to submit past performance information shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate.  Offerors are required to provide information on no more than three (3) of the firm?s most recently completed U.S. Navy (not to exceed three years since completion) for like or similar services to those to be provided under this RFQ.  Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.  Offerors who present similar contracts/orders should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contract/order to the requirements of the solicitation.  
Offerors lacking relevant past performance history, or for whom past performance information is either not available or has not been submitted to the Government, will receive a neutral rating for past performance.  A neutral rating will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably.  However, the proposal with no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral in past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the proposals of other offerors having acceptable or better past performance.
Offerors are cautioned that the Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any sources including sources outside of the Government.  The Government will obtain whatever information it deems most relevant to the required effort by telephonic and/or written inquiry.  This information may include Contracting Officer?s knowledge and experience with contracts he or she has written, Performance Assessment Reporting Systems (CPARS), or past performance information from any source.  The information contained in offeror's Past Performance submittals will be evaluated by the PCO with the assistance of a Contract Specialist, if assigned.  The PCO will evaluate the offeror's Past Performance using the following sub-factors, which are of equal importance.
(a) Quality:  The offeror?s demonstrated history of delivering products and services of high quality and compliance with contractual requirements.  Quality will be evaluated in terms of: overall customer satisfaction, instances of rework and/or deficiency reports, and evidence of effective and/or innovative work applications that were beneficial to the customer.
(b)Timeliness: The offeror?s compliance with delivery and/or performance schedules, timeliness of submission of requested information, reports, and invoicing. 
(c) Contractor Responsiveness:  The offeror?s demonstrated ability to respond to customer concerns, isolate and resolve problems, and take systemic improvement action.
Each performance risk assessment of the factors listed above will consider:  the number, type, and severity of problems, the effectiveness of corrective actions taken and the overall work record.  
The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be the product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror?s performance on a list of contracts, but rather the product of subjective judgment of the government after it considers all available, relevant and recent information, therefore the adjectival ratings generally correlate with the definitions of performance risk as follows: 
Very Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, virtually no doubt exists that the offeror will very successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets and exceeds contractual requirements to the Federal Government?s benefit.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed was accomplished with some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor were effective.  This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Low Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, little doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort. Performance meets contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains some minor problems for which corrective actions taken by the contractor appears or were satisfactory. This equates to Highly Acceptable (HA).
Moderate Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, some doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet some contractual requirements.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed reflects a serious problem for which the contractor has not yet identified corrective actions or the contractor?s proposed actions appear only marginally effective or were not fully implemented. This equates to Acceptable (A).
High Performance Risk:  Based on the offeror's performance record, significant doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Performance does not meet most contractual requirements and recovery is not likely in a timely manner.  The contractual performance of the element being assessed contains serious problem(s) for which the contractor?s corrective actions appear or were ineffective. This equates to Marginal (M).
Neutral:  No relevant past performance history, or for which past performance information is not provided or available.  Unknown performance risk assessment.  This equates to Neutral (N).
Under most circumstances, it will be unnecessary to divulge the solicitation number, or other identifying information to the reference.  In the event that it is necessary, you need to obtain a non-disclosure statement from the party to whom the information was provided.
The assessment of the offeror?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offerors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFP.  In determining the rating of past performance evaluation factor, the Government will give greater consideration to the contracts which the Government determines are most relevant to the RFP. 
2.  Price:  The PCO will evaluate Price.  When the proposals are received, the PCO shall review the submission of offers as specified in FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors? Commercial Items (Jan 2004), paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(11).
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous to the Government.  Offers must include prices for the CLIN listed.  Failure to do this may be cause for rejection of the offer for the CLIN listed.
The offeror?s proposed price will be evaluated on the basis of price reasonableness in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.404-1.  The evaluation may include, but is not limited to: 
a)	Price comparison with other offerors; 
b)	Completeness:  All pricing information as it directly relates to the SOW; and
c)	Comparison with independent Government estimates.
Although price is the least most important evaluation factor, it has the potential to become more significant during the evaluation process.  The degree of importance of the price will increase with the degree of equality of the proposals in relation to the other factor on which selection is to be based.  The importance of price will also increase when a proposal's price is so significantly high as to diminish the value to the Government that might be gained under the other aspects of the offer.  If, at any stage of the evaluation, all offeror?s are determined to have submitted equal, or virtually equal, or generally equivalent, non-price proposals, price could become the factor in determining which offeror shall received the award; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (JAN 2004) ALTERNATE I (APR 2002), FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items (OCT 2003)(a) Inspection/Acceptance Addendum:  Contractor shall expect a reasonable degree of pre-acceptance inspection by ship?s representative(s) to validate and confirm all final product conforms to the specifications described in this solicitation and in conjunction with what is considered industry standard on U.S. Navy vessels here in Norfolk, FAR 52.212-5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders (JAN 2004) within this clause, the following clauses apply and are incorporated by reference: 52.219-06 Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside (June 2003),   52.222-19 Child Labor?Cooperation with Authorities and Remedies (JAN 2004)(E.O. 13126), 52.222-21 Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (Feb 1999), 52.222-26 Equal Opportunity (APR 2002) (E.O. 11246), 52.222-35 Equal Opportunity for Special Disabled Veterans, Veterans of the Vietnam Era and other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-36 Affirmative Action for Workers with Disabilities (JUN 1998) (29 U.S.C. 793), 52.222-37 Employment Reports on Special Disabled Veterans and Veterans of the Vietnam Era and Other Eligible Veterans (DEC 2001) (38 U.S.C. 4212), 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965 (JUL 2005), 52.222-42 Statement of Equivalent rates for Federal Hires (MAY 1989), 52.225-13 Restrictions on Certain Foreign Purchases (OCT 2003) (E.O.S, proclamations, and statutes administered by Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of Treasury), 52.232-33 Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer --Central Contractor Registration (OCT 2003) (31 U.S.C. 3322), FAR 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission Of Payment Requests (DEC 2003), FAR 52.215-5 Facsimile Proposals (OCT 1997).

<SUBJECT>36 -- Honeycomb Wash Conveyor System
<SOLNBR>AG-6395-S-07-0072

<DESC>***The purpose of this amendment is to post the questions and answers related to this item which are as follows: QUESTION ONE - I have a question on part IX.  Stages 2 3 and 4 below do they need to be heated and if so what temperature? 1)A bleach solution (3-12% bleach) wash station with heaters  capable of heating the solution to 140 F in the wash station. 2) A high pressure rinse station. 3) A low pressure rinse station and 4) A high pressure air drying station.  ANSWER - No heat on stations 2, 3, 4.  QUESTION TWO - What would be the size limitations (or preferences) of this unit?   We understand that you may have a specific area in which you would like to place this conveyor and it would be our desire to accommodate that need. For example, if due to space restrictions the unit can be only  1 meter wide then the honeycomb would need to be sent thought the conveyor one at a time, or in single file.  But if the unit can be 2 meters wide then the honeycombs can be sent though side by side in groups of 2,3, or even 4.  This, of course would greatly effect the required length of the unit.  ANSWER - We have the space for a 2 meter wide washer.  QUESTION THREE - Has there been any R&D done which has determined the amount of time the honeycombs need to remain under "high pressure" wash in order to become clean?  And what pressure can the honeycomb take before they begin to lose their integrity?  ANSWER - The honey comb can withstand up to 1500 PSI. This is the higest pressure we have tested . The wash time required to make the honeycomb clean has not been established.  Remember prior to high pressure wash we will run through a low pressure bleach concentration  wash. ***

DETERMINATION AND FINDINGS (Attachment 1)

SUBJECT:  Brand Name Procurement (National Crane)

FINDINGS

1.  In accordance with (IAW) FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases less than the SAT, the Contracting Officer may make a determination to solicit for ?brand name? only. Also,  IAW IG5306 in Air Force Contracting Guidelines, J&A is not required for purchases under procedures in FAR Part 13 (see above). Dollar amount on requirement does not expect to exceed the SAT.

2.  IAW 10 USC 2304(c)(1), the property or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. Procuring a brand name other than National Crane will require recertification and training course (see attached memo) of operators in 341 MOS. Consequently, the Government will not be able to meet 564th deactivation deadlines. 


DETERMINATION

Based on the findings above and IAW Air Force Instructions, it is hereby determined that a brand-name procurement for this requirement of National Crane is in the best interest of the Government.

SCOPE OF WORK

INTRODUCTION:
The purpose of this contract is to collect available information on the characteristics of areas of concern, such as Natural Reserves around Puerto Rico, specifically benthic habitat, and impacts of non-fishing activities on these areas.  The information obtained will help in characterizing and selecting habitats for future monitoring of impacts of non-fishing activities.  The project will result in a compilation of historical information on the status of marine resources for areas identified as priorities for conservation by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DNER).  This project addresses some of the needs identified in the Local Action Strategy Overfishing Group priority project, ?Select, characterize and monitor those habitats essential for fishery resources that are being affected by non-fishing activities.?

BACKGROUND:
Non-fishing activities often result in negative impacts to the coral reef ecosystem, including associated fishing resources, around Puerto Rico, in particular due to the loss of benthic habitat.  Recreational activities that result in trampling of seagrasses and corals, cutting of mangrove roots and branches to create areas of shade or tie up boats; coastal development that results in erosion and sediment transport to the sea, clearing of mangroves, seagrasses, and other wetlands, and water quality changes; and boat groundings are some of the non-fishing activities that have been identified as impacting the coral reef ecosystem.  As part of Goal Number 4 of the Local Action Strategy Plan, Overfishing Theme, the Puerto Rico government, through the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources, is working to reduce the negative impacts on non-fishing activities to the coral reef ecosystem, including associated fishery resources.

This project is being initiated as a component of NMFS? efforts on behalf of the Coral Reef Task Force established by President Clinton in June 1998 through Executive Order #13089. The Executive Order, identified as Coral Reef Protection, seeks to ?preserve and protect the biodiversity, health, heritage, and social and economic value of U.S. coral reef ecosystems and marine environment.?

SCOPE:
Start date: Date of award 
End date: September 30, 2008 

In order to meet the objective of this contract the contractor shall complete the work in two distinct phases:  the compilation of historical information for priority areas, including reports, maps, and geographic data in electronic form; and final report detailing the methods used to collect the information, sources of information, and presenting tables with information on habitats in the areas, changes over time, and geographic references.  Short-term results will consist of the production of a detailed report with qualitative information on changes to important marine habitat areas over time.  Long-term results will consist of the identification of those systems and the activities that should be considered for monitoring and the implementation of management to protect marine resources.

The project operation must be conducted in order to carry out the technical tasks described in this document within the established timeframe.  The contractor must report any problems or complications that may arise during the realization of each task that could affect the time table.

These areas are mainly designated natural and marine reserves.  The contractor shall use a literature review prepared as part of an FY04 coral project that is available in the NMFS Caribbean Field Office as a starting point to determine which references should be consulted as part of this contract in order to summarize historic information regarding marine resources within priority areas over time.  The contractor shall obtain copies of documents that contain critical historical information regarding the sites and are not available in the NMFS Caribbean Field Office and provide these copies to NMFS as part of this contract.  The contractor shall create tables with summary information regarding the geographic location of habitat studies within the priority areas with coordinates where possible, the type of habitat, dates of studies, etc.  The contractor shall also obtain copies of historic maps in paper and electronic format and benthic maps in paper and electronic format (except NMFS benthic maps for Puerto Rico, which are available in the NMFS Caribbean Field Office) and provide these copies to NMFS.

B)  The contractor shall also compile information regarding development impacts to marine resources in these areas based on scientific studies, theses, reports, and other sources available in the University of Puerto Rico libraries, DNER offices and library NMFS office, FWS library, and CFMC library.  The contractor shall use a literature review prepared as part of an FY06 coral project that is available in the NMFS Caribbean Field Office as a starting point to determine which references should be used to compile historic information on non-fishing impacts to marine resources over time.  The contractor shall obtain copies of documents that contain critical historical information regarding non-fishing impacts to marine resources within the priority sites and are not available in the NMFS Caribbean Field Office and provide these copies to NMFS as part of this contract.  The contractor shall create tables with summary information regarding the geographic location of studies documenting non-fishing impacts within the priority areas with coordinates where possible, the type of habitat impacted, dates of studies, types of impacts, etc.  The contractor shall also obtain copies of surveys, images, etc. of non-fishing habitat impacts such as the recreational boater survey using aerial photographs performed annually by DNER as part of a mooring buoy project and provide these copies to NMFS in paper or electronic format.

C)  The contractor shall submit monthly progress reports in electronic or paper form detailing the work completed to date, including drafts of the tables for review and comment by NMFS.  The contractor can submit the copies of documents and geographic information obtained as part of this task along with the progress reports or as copies are acquired.


	Task II. Final Report

The contractor shall prepare a final report detailing the methods used to collect information on marine resources and non-fishing impacts within priority areas, sources of information, and presenting the final summary tables with information on habitats in the areas, changes over time, geographic references, impacts from non-fishing activities, etc.  Any copies of documents and geographic data not provided to NMFS as part of Task 1 shall also be submitted along with the final report in paper and electronic format when possible.  Four copies of the final report in hard copy and ten copies of the final report in electronic format shall be submitted to NMFS.
