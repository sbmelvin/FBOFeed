<DESC>AUTOSAMPLERS: The United States Geological Survey intends to issue an order under other than full and open competition to Astoria Pacific International, P.O. Box 830 Clackamas, Oregon 97015. The purpose of this acquisition is to purchase an Autosampler.The automated flow analyzer will be used in the Common Use Laboratory of the Branch of Regional Research / Northeastern Region to analyze nutrients in natural water samples. The analyzer should meet the following specifications: 1.	The analyzer should have three channels and six detectors. Three channels should be capable of analyzing for Ortho-Phosphorus, Nitrate/Nitrite, and Ammonia simultaneously in natural water samples by the approved USGS methods listed in item 3 below. The other channels and detectors are for Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen, which is to be analyzed separately.  2.	The analyzer must be capable of analyzing at least 60 samples per hour for Ortho- Phosphate by USGS method I-4601-85 and Ammonia by USGS method I-4522-85. 3.	The analyzer must be able to meet our current detection limits for low level nutrients using the referenced method (detection limits can be lower than these stated here, but not higher). These are 0.001 mg/L for Nitrite (USGS Method I-4540-85) and 0.002 mg/L for Ortho-Phosphate (USGS Method I-4601-85), Ammonia (USGS Method I-4522-85), Nitrate/Nitrite (USGS Method I-4545-85) and Total Phosphorus (USGS Method I-4600- 85). 4.	The analyzer must have a 6 channel digital detector capable of measuring absorbance over more than one dynamic range without the need of operator intervention in order to expand the concentration range of the determination. The detector should interface with computer software to provide automatic ranging of the detector signal on the computer display of the sample peaks.  The detectors for each channel must work at the following wavelengths: 		Nitrite	520 nm 		Nitrate/Nitrite	520 nm 		Ammonia	660 nm 		Ortho-Phosphorus	880 nm 		Total Phosphorus	880 nm 5.	The mixing coils must be made of glass in order to facilitate the transition of methods from our current low-level analysis system. 6.	In order to be better able to analyze unfiltered samples, there should be no right angle bends or connections in the flow path where sediment can collect and impede flow through the system. 7.	An XYZ autosampler capable of handling at least 180 sample cups is required. There should be an auto-diluter added to the sampler. 8.	Instrument should be compatible with those in use at the USGS-WRD National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL) in Denver, Colorado and in Ocala, Florida.  Obtaining an instrument that is directly compatible with the instruments used in the NWQL will facilitate the exchange of methodology and limit duplication of effort between laboratories in the USGS, thus saving time and money for method development in the future.  Astoria Pacific International is the only know source that provides the above specifications.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  See note 22.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for 40, 22-bit USB data acquisition units with 16 digital I/O & 2 frequency/pulse input channels. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from IOtech.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as contemplated by the provisions of FAR 6.302-1 which states, full and open competition need not be provided for when "Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in - substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition".  In this case the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (ARED) project team has previously selected this particular model as final flight hardware design.  Initial units have been purchased to build a prototype system and now the project requires purchase of all flight units.	 The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 27, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a single unit of the 810 system used for fatigue and fracture mechanics testing of materials.  The unit is required for integration with a new FTA-ADwin data acquisition and control system and a new FRACTOMAT crack measurement system. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from MTS Systems Corporation, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1.  The justification for the single source and for duplicating the existing three test systems is that a change in any of the three listed components of the new system would result in significant impacts-primarily in the training of technicians, hardware maintenance and repairs, needed revisions of software, and testing capability.  These expenses could not be recaptured through competition. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research is soliciting white papers for development and transition of aircraft nondestructive inspection (NDI) technologies designed to reduce operations and support cost without compromising fleet safety and readiness. The primary area of interest is to inspect/assess structural damage and cracks/delamination on aircraft components without removing paint during on-condition or scheduled periodic inspections. 

The rapidly increasing inspection hours per flight hour can be ascribed to the detrimental impact of materials damage on aging aircraft structural components, a condition that has been widely recognized for years.

Accordingly, there is a need for practical and affordable methodologies to detect and monitor the onset of structural damage, cracks and delamination on critical parts of aircraft in real time.  These technologies must accurately depict deteriorating conditions of materials (metals and composites) without disassembly or removal of components. Application of these devices must be as non-intrusive as possible, provide wide area inspection capability, and result in a significant reduction in inspection and processing time over current inspection methods with a false alarm rate approaching zero. They should be easy to handle in normal field conditions. The data collected by these inspection devices must enable technicians to interpret information, characterize the problem, and recommend proper maintenance actions.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award, on a Sole Source basis, a fixed price contract to the Peter Lamy Center for Drug Therapy and Aging, University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, 515 West Lombard Street, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, to expand upon the initial one-year findings to consider patient-level, institutional-level, and medication-level factors behind these prescribing patterns.  The analysis of anti-psychotic drug use will consist of four elements: (1) a 
4-year, nationally-representative trend analysis of anti-psychotic use in nursing home and assisted-living populations, (2) descriptive tables describing which institutionalized beneficiaries tend to get anti-psychotics, including information on health status and their residential setting, (3) descriptive tables describing their psychoactive and overall medication use, including details on the types of anti-psychotics and other psychoactive medications, and (4) a manuscript describing the study approach, salient findings, and a literature review suitable for an audience of policy-makers.  In addition, the project will evaluate the utilization of drug treatment by aged Medicare beneficiaries with Cardiovascular disease; the use of anticholinergic medications by nursing home residents, and the use of analgesics by nursing home residents in order to develop a profile of pain management in these residents.

<DESC>NA This procurement is for 2,500 M40A1 Medium Masks, NSN: 4240-01-370-3822, P/N: 5-1- 2740-20 and is restricted to ILC Manufactured Products Division, Two Moonwalker Road, Frederica, DE 19946.  This is published for subcontracting purposes only and offers from concerns other than the above are not solicited.  Note 22 applies.  A mask consis ts of a silicone rubber facepiece with a filter canister.  The facepeice is equipped with front and side voicemitters, drink tube, and eye lenses.  Clear and neutral gray outserts protect the eye lenses and reduce glare and lens fogging.  A hood, not perma nently attached to the facepiece, provides protection of the head and neck.  A canvas carrier is provided with each mask for storing and carrying the mask and its accessories.  A waterproof bag is provided for temporary storage of the facepiece when requir ed by climate and mission.  A faceform holds the facepiece in proper shape when stored longer than 30 days.  The silicone rubber facepiece fits closely against the face to form a seal. Air enters the canister and passes through an air deflector into the ey e area of the facepiece.  The canister (screwed on to either the left or right side of the facepiece) filters out the CB agents, toxins, and radioactive particles.  From the eye area, air enters a nosecup and is inhaled through the nosecup valves.  Exhaled  air passes through the nosecup area and is expelled through an outlet valve.  Outserts are fitted with a rubber ring, which hold them securely to the facepiece eye lenses.  Optical inserts, available by medical prescription, are required for personnel who  must wear glasses.  The mask does not protect the wearer from ammonia or carbon monoxide.  It is not effective where the amount of oxygen in the air is too low to support life.

<CONTACT>Martha Youngblood, Contracting Officer, 505 845-4268, myoungblood@doeal.gov;David Gallegos, Contract Specialist, 505-845-5849, dgallegos@doeal.gov
<DESC>The US DOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Transportation Safeguards (OST) intends to procure 40 MM Grenade Launchers (a sole item) from Heckler & Koch, Inc., (a sole source) to meet its critical mission requirements.  NNSA has determined that the Heckler & Koch, Inc. 40 MM Grenade Launcher is the only item meeting NNSA OST mission requirements - based on its double action trigger system, 50-350MM ladder sight, breach loaded, ability to use various 40MM rounds (smoke, signal flares, etc.) and removable butt stock for stand-alone applications - and no other grenade launcher available has these capabilities.  NNSA has also determined that the Heckler & Koch, Inc. 40 MM Grenade Launcher is a military/law enforcement weapons system with strict guidelines for sales from the US Department of Justice (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) - and with strict company guidelines restricting sales of this weapon only to the federal government; since Heckler & Koch, Inc. does not permit any of their distributors to sell the weapon system, the NNSA must procure the item on a sole source basis.  Therefore, NNSA intends to conduct this sole-item/sole-source procurement under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 and no other items or sources will be considered.  A public solicitation will not be available.  This notice satisfies the requirements of FAR Part 5.  The estimated value of the procurement is $283,000.  Any questions or comments pertaining to this planned action should be addressed to David Gallegos, NNSA Contract Specialist, at (505) 845-5849.

<DESC>The NINDS intends to negotiate a follow-on contract with University of Utah to continue pharmacologic evaluations of potential anticonvulsant compounds. A new 5-year award (July 2004 -- July 2009) is anticipated. The Anticonvulsant Screening Project (ASP) conducts an extensive drug discovery and translational science effort aimed at identifying potential new antiepileptic agents to be developed and marketed for treatment of human epilepsy disorders. Active compounds are tested through a series of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic evaluations (both in vivo and in vitro tests) that help define a candidate’s anticonvulsant profile including activity, neurotoxicity, effect on hepatic microsomal metabolizing enzymes and pharmacodynamic interactions. These efforts have been carried out under the contract mechanism since 1975 with the University of Utah. Approximately 800 compounds are evaluated for anticonvulsant activity per year. Overall testing requirements include, but are not limited to, the following: 1) Anticonvulsant Identification: Testing includes the evaluation of anticonvulsant activity and associated neurotoxicity in mice, following intraperitoneal administration of 100 mg/kg of test compound using the 6 Hz induced focal seizure test for approximately 800 candidate compounds.  Compounds displaying significant anticonvulsant activity by the 6 Hz test may be further evaluated following intraperitoneal administration of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg using the supramaximal electroshock seizure pattern test (MES), the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol (sc Met) threshold test and the rotorod test. Those compounds possessing significant anticonvulsant activity in mice shall also be evaluated in rats in the MES, pentylenetetrazol and neurological deficit seizure tests. 2) Anticonvulsant Quantitation -- Candidate compounds found active in the identification screens shall be subjected to further testing designed to establish ED50's for the 6 Hz, MES, sc Met tests and TD50's for minimal motor impairment. The anticonvulsant activity and minimal motor impairment shall be quantitated following both intraperitoneal and oral administration to mice and rats at previously determined time of peak effects. 3) Pharmacologic Differentiation -- An anticonvulsant profile shall be developed for selected candidate compounds wherein the efficacy of the novel agent will be compared with that of prototype drugs. As part of this process, the anticonvulsant efficacy of candidate compounds shall be quantitated in mice using seizures induced by bicuculline and picrotoxin. The anticonvulsant profile of candidate anticonvulsant compounds shall be further developed in rats by the gamma-butrylactone (GBL) spike-wave model of absence and by the rapid hippocampal-kindling model of complex partial seizures. Candidate substances shall also be evaluated for their ability to block the expression of kindled seizures in the rapid hippocampal kindling model. A limited number of compounds shall additionally be tested for their ability to block the acquisition of kindled seizures induced by rapid hippocampal stimulation. The anticonvulsant profile of selected test substances shall also include a genetically susceptible model of reflex epilepsy. 4) Evaluation of Proconvulsant Potential --The length of time taken for the first evidence of seizure activity following the infusion of pentylenetetrazol into the tail vein of mice shall be used as a measure of seizure threshold. 5) Evaluation of Mechanism of Action -- Studies directed toward elucidating anticonvulsant mechanism(s) of action shall be conducted on a limited number of test substances. These include the use of whole cell voltage-clamp recordings from cortical neurons in primary culture to characterize possible interactions with GABA and glutamate receptors. 6) Drug Interaction Studies - The metabolic potential for drug-drug interactions are determined using human liver microsomes.  The potential for a candidate substance to inhibit a battery of the major P-450 human liver isozymes are determined along with comparative assessment of the standard available anticonvulsants. 7) Mutagenicity – The Ames will be employed to identify whether a compound is or has pro-mutagen activity and whether bioactivation in this screen is cytochrome P450 dependant.  Comparison with known mutagens and pro-mutagens at various concentrations are required. 8) Lamotrigine Resistant Kindled Rat Test -. Animals will be kindled according to the procedure described by Postma et al. (2000).  Seizures will be scored according to a Racine Scale (Racine, 1972).  In addition, the seizure score and afterdischarge duration will be recorded for each animal.  9) AED Modulation of Axonal Neurotransmission - This will be assessed via two tests: Partial Ligation of the Sciatic Nerve and the Formalin Test:  This model is ideally suited for efficacy of an investigational AED against the acute and chronic hyper-responsive neuronal discharges following activation of peripheral nerve fibers. Positive results in one or both of these models will: 1) support the broad-spectrum activity identified in the acute seizure models; and 2) imply activity for other non-epilepsy indications. Selected compounds will have summary reports prepared detailing all methodologies and comparative values to known anticonvulsants. 

During the past 28 years, the University of Utah has been able to successfully adopt specialized techniques, methods of evaluation and accumulation of extensive pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles for all the current therapeutic agents and new investigational drugs. This accumulation of data and experiences is the basis by which all new test compounds are pharmacologically compared.  The NINDS believes that the University of Utah is the only known source for performing these comprehensive evaluations by virtue of their experience, demonstrated expertise, availability of required staff, laboratory and animal facilities and requisite resources. NINDS' requirement for consistency and compatibility of data derived from these screening procedures is paramount to the success of this program. Inability to produce compatible evaluation results to our existing data base would lead to delays in screening new compounds and incurrence of duplicate costs, both of which would be unacceptable to the Government and would disrupt the continuity of this work. Organizations that believe they have the qualifications and capabilities necessary to undertake this work should submit complete documentation of staffing, facilities, and methodologies currently in place to the Contracting Officer at the above address within 45 days from the date of this announcement. An organization must have an ongoing program with available staff with substantial experience in conducting the required tests, equipment, space and infrastructure in place to carry out the work described above. Authority: 41 U.S.C. 253 (c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. This is not a formal solicitation nor an annoucement that a Request for Proposals (RFP) is available.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>EXPERT SERVICES: This is a notice of a proposed award to Personnel Research Decisions Institutes (PDRI) for their continued assistance in developing world-class performance appraisal systems for GAO Analysts/Specialist staff, Attorney staff and Administrative Professional and Support Staff (APSS) staff.  PDRI has already completed, under contract with GAO, much of the work on these systems  and is needed to continue the work for additional refinements.  The new Analyst/Specialist system was implemented in January 2002 and enabled GAO managers to carry out the full range of performance management responsibilities (i.e., coaching and feedback, employee development, compensation, rewards, recognition, promotions, counseling and discipline).  A complementary system for the Attorney Community was implemented in October 2002 and work is on-going to implement a new system for the APSS community.

This award will result in three separate contracts for each of the personnel systems.  This is not a request for a quotation.  No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice.  All inquiries and concerns must be addressed in writing to U.S. General Accounting Office, 
441 G Street, NW, Room 6B46, Washington, D.C., Attention Ms.Darion A. Powell.  Responses to this notice must be received within 30 days after electronic posting.  Ms. Darion A. Powell, Contracting Officer, voicemail (202) 512-3725, fax (202)

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute, Health Communication and Informatics Research Branch (HCIRB), intends on entering into a sole source contract with the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), Center for Communication Policy (CCP) for support of additional modules to the annual UCLA, “Surveying the Digital Future” longitudinal survey as a strategy for expanding the reach of data collected with the NCI’s Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) research projects.  The HINTS project collects data about the American public’s access to health information, preference for communication channels, and use of health information.   UCLA launched the annual “Surveying the Digital Divide”  research project to examine the social, political and economic impact of Internet technology on society, both nationally and internationally.  For the first time in 2003, UCLA will be adding a health information module to this important survey.  The Internet is a vital source of health information for many people and promises to become even more important in the future.  Data from the UCLA study will  complement HINTS by providing in-depth information about public Internet access and use, as well as expand NCI data collection about health information access and use.

<ARCHDATE>10052003
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Otelia Newsome, Purchasing Agent, Phone (919) 541-3164
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   URL:  newsome.otelia@epa.gov.  The EPA intends to award a sole source procurement on or about September 5, 2003 to Higher Nines Energy Services/Dr. Victor Gorokhov, pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1):--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will supply agency requirements.  EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards ( OAQPS) managed EPA's Russia Air Management Project (RAMP) from 1992 until 1999.  RAMP was a cooperative effort between EPA and the Russian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources to improve national  institutions, policies and practices for air quality management in Russia.  Various American air quality management techniques were adapted to the situation in Russia and implemented in the industrial city of Volgograd.  An inexpensive U. S. control technique for iron and steel mills?the precast  delta?was implemented successfully in an iron and steel mill in Volgograd.  The demonstration was very successful and generated a great deal of interest in Russia but there were inadequate resources to disseminate and implement this strategy throughout Russia and the other Newly Independent States  (NIS).  The initial step shall be to inventory operating EAFs and the types of roofs used in Russia and the former Soviet Union to begin to assess the potential market for precast deltas.  Equally important will be communications with U.S. Department of Commerce and others to engage potential  partners who have expertise in making ventures like this commercially successful and could take the initiative for subsequent steps. The project's goal is to compile the inventory of the EAFs and roof types and transfer that knowledge to the Department of Commerce or others in the United States and  in Russia who are better qualified to help implement the strategy commercially--a Russian institute, an American business or government agency, or a combination of the two.  He was the Principal Investigator for the iron and steel elements of the RAMP project.  As such, he led the design and  implementation of the precast delta strategy in Volgograd through design, production, transport, installation, testing and evaluation.  He has over 30 years of experience in power engineering and environmental protection, including more than 15 years experience with power plant equipment in the  former Soviet Union.  He is particularly knowledgeable about the iron and steel industry in Russia and the other Newly Independent States.  As a native Russian, Dr. Gorokhov has a command of the language, which is essential for the timely completion of the project.  With this background, he is able  to immediately initiate this project, including identifying and making a working agreement with a Russian institute/firm to assist in gathering data in Russia.  He has demonstrated a wealth of expertise with the iron and steel industry in Russia, the other NIS, and eastern Europe in general and  with the precast delta technology transfer in Russia in particular.  As such, he is uniquely qualified to lead this effort and to work with a Russian firm/institute to gather data and develop a strategy to disseminate the precast delta strategy.  No Request for Quotation is available and this  notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  All responsible sources may respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability within 15 days of this notice to Otelia Newsome at the above address for consideration by the Agency.  Responses must include detailed  technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet these requirements.  Responses shall also include itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days of this notice  to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the government, an order will be placed with Higher Nines Energy Services/Dr. Victor Gorokhov. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the  discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

In addition, these capsules shall have the capability to be installed in the SSGN Multiple AUR Canister (MAC).

NAVAIR intends to award this effort to Raytheon Systems Company (RSC), P.O. Box 11337, Tucson, AZ 85734-1337.  Raytheon is the only company capable of performing this effort.  Since 1994, RSC has been the sole developer, designer, and manufacturer for the Tomahawk All-Up-Round (AUR).  RSC solely possesses the current configuration and manufacturing data for the Tactical Tomahawk missile.  RSC currently manages the key requirements, interface, integration, and verification documents for the Tomahawk Weapons System.  Because a detailed knowledge and expertise of the Tactical Tomahawk missile is required to perform this upgrade to the CCLS, RSC is the only source capable of accomplishing this requirement in the required timeframe and without duplication of costs.

<DESC>STATEMENT OF WORK – ANALYZING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF WOMEN’S BUSINESS CENTER PROGRAMS FOR THE NATIONAL WOMEN’S BUSINESS COUNCIL 

BACKGROUND

The National Women’s Business Council is a bi-partisan public policy advisory body created to serve as an independent source of advice to the President, Congress, and others on economic issues of importance to women business owners.  The Council is committed to:
•	Conducting research on issues of importance to women business owners and their organizations; 
•	Communicating these findings widely; 
•	Connecting the women’s business community to public policy makers; and 
•	Providing a platform for change to expand and improve opportunities for women business owners and their enterprises.

The NWBC is interested in analyzing and measuring the economic impact of the Women’s Business Center program, which is administered by the Small Business Administration’s (SBA’s) Office of Women’s Business Ownership (OWBO). The 80+ Women’s Business Centers nationwide provide women entrepreneurs with business training and counseling, technical assistance, mentoring, and access to the SBA’s programs and services. They also have programs to assist economically and socially disadvantaged women, especially those on welfare. Each center tailors its services to the needs of the local community.

This study will provide a quantifiable impact of the Women’s Business Center program, taking a macro-economic view. The analysis will look at business growth trends and other indicators correlated with the existence and size of Women’s Business Centers, including the number of women business owners served and location of the Centers. It will include an analysis of the relationship of size and longevity of Center with business and job growth in the region and will compare women’s business growth in metropolitan areas with and without women’s business centers.

STATEMENT OF WORK

Task Number One:  Research and Study. The contractor shall gather available information on factors associated with each Women’s Business Center (WBC), including, but not limited to, size of Center, geographic location, presence of SBA or other partners near the Center, and number of clients served. This data shall be collected for all available years and will be made available to the contractor by the SBA’s Office of Women’s Business Ownership. Macro-economic factors will be collected in both those areas with women’s business centers and matching areas without a Center. Existing data to be collected will include, but not be limited to, growth of women-owned businesses, overall economic growth, demographics, and population density. Other existing data to be collected will include state report cards and other data related to the state of women’s entrepreneurship. The researcher will use the collected data to conduct an analysis of the state and impact of women’s business centers. This analysis must include correlation analysis along with other statistical methods.

Task Number Two:  Development of Findings and Preparation of Final Report. The contractor shall explain its findings from the analysis detailed in Task Number One in a report. The report must include, but not be limited to, an outline of the process and data the contractor used for this study. The report shall include an executive summary and a bibliography listing all sources of data and information used. Proposed questions to be addressed in this study include:
•	Do WBCs in urban areas perform differently than those in suburban or rural areas?
•	Does the existence of other service providers (SBA or otherwise) impact the size of or services offered by WBCs?
•	How does the economic growth compare in metropolitan areas with a WBC compared to those without a WBC?

PROGRESS REPORTS
The contractor shall be required to provide a report detailing the progress made on the project and identifying and addressing problems encountered. This progress report shall be delivered to the Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (“COTR”). At the end of one month, the contractor shall first provide a preliminary report to the COTR showing the data that will be collected, method, process, and statistical design of the study. The contractor shall also include in the report a timely response to any questions or clarification of any points raised by the COTR about the data, or study method and design. At two-month intervals from the date of contract award, the contractor shall provide interim reports on the progress and shall also provide a timely response to any questions or clarification on any points raised by the COTR about the interim reports. At least one draft version of the report shall be supplied to the COTR in advance of the final deliverable. The final report must take into consideration comments received from government employees and the COTR.

The NWBC currently uses a variety of communications vehicles to fulfill its mission.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to negotiate a sole-source agreement with the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI) for the purpose of providing services to organize and conduct a 1-day policy research and education seminar that would examine the interactions between workers compensation and SSA’s disability programs.  NASI has been collecting and analyzing workers compensation state data for use by agencies, academicians, and various organizations and companies conducting research work in related areas since 1995.  In addition, NASI examines policy and procedural issues related to workers’ compensation programs and the interrelationship between those programs and other disability program.  In order to systematically collect and analyze state date, NASI has organized and heads a Workers’ Compensation Steering Committee comprised of the nations’ leading experts in workers’ compensation policy and practice.  This unique steering committee provides expertise needed to shape the data collection and review process, as well as the expertise needed to inform NASI’s policy-related discussions and analyses in the areas of disability and workers compensation.  As a result, NASI has the unique expertise to provide the most comprehensive national aggregates and State-level estimates of workers’ compensation costs and benefits, as well as the mechanisms to readily provide the best high-level research and analysis as a result of the data they have collected. The research seminar is to be conducted in Sept/Oct 2003 timeframe.  See Number Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Project Number 960703: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10834 (Base) Project Number 960704: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10835 (Option I) Project Number 960705: Repair Fire Safety/AC, Facility 10836 (Option II) Solicitation Number F33601-03-R-0050. The scope of this project consists of furnishing all materials and performing  all labor required to complete the replacement of the fan coil units,  heating/cooling water system, windows, and roof in Facilities 10834, 10835, and  10836.  The scope will also include associated architectural, mechanical,  plumbing, electrical, and miscellaneous work as shown on the project drawings  and described in the specifications.  The estimated price range is  between $1M and $5M.  The NAICS Code is 238220.  The size standard is $12M.   This is an UNRESTRICTED procurement in accordance with the Small Business  Competitiveness Demonstration Program Act of 1988, Public Law 100-656 (15  U.S.C. 644 note). In accordance with DFARS 252.204-7004, contractors must be registered in the  Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to award of solicitations issued  after 31 May 1998.  Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov, or  telephone at 1-888-CCR-2423.  Every solicitation issued after 31 May 1998 must  include the clause at DFARS 252.204-7004, *Required Central Contractor  Registration.: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: This project involves  the Visitor Quarters (VQ), which houses military and  civilian personnel of all levels, including VIPs on  Temporary Duty at WPAFB for numerous official Air Force  activities.  This project is in an extremely high  visibility area, due to the number of visiting individuals  housed at any one time, and will receive an unusually high  level of scrutiny.  This project will be subject to a very  tight construction schedule.  The project is in phases, and  involves work in each room.  This work will require close  coordination between disciplines, and close supervision by  the contractor in order to minimize the number of  unavailable rooms at any one time.  The work must be  accomplished so that the remaining occupied units will not  be impacted, nor the personnel housed in them  inconvenienced.  The requirement to supervise and  coordinate the work in all of the rooms contained in the  VQ will present the contractor with a difficult  construction management challenge.  Failure to supervise  and coordinate the different trades required to provide a  quality and timely product will not be acceptable.   Performance is critical to minimize disruption to WPAFB  activities.  The liquidated damages associated with not  meeting the contractual period of performance will be high  due to the cost of housing Air Force personnel off base if  the rooms are not available on schedule. NOTES: (1) The solicitation, specifications, and drawings will be available on the  website on or about 14 July 03, at http://www.pixs.wpafb.af.mil. (2) Hard copies of the solicitation will NOT be provided.  However, you may  download and print the file from the website. (3) There is no fee for this solicitation. (4) A hard copy of the solicitation will be available for review at Dayton  Builders Exchange, Minority Contractor Business Assistance Program, and F.W.  Dodge Division in Dayton, OH. (5) A registration page will be attached to the website.  You are not required  to register.  Howeverm when you register you will receive notice of any  amendments and/or addendums that may be issued to the solicitation.  If you  have not registered, it will be your responsibility to check the website for  any changes to the solicitation. (6) Contractors shall be capable of securing bonding for the total proposed  amount (base plus options).  However, contractors shall only be responsible for  providing bonding for the base amount plus the amount of any/all options  exercised at the time of award.  If an option is exercised after award,  contractors shall be responsible for securing the additional bonding equal to  the amount of the option. (7) You shall provide a signed copy of the SF 1442 by the proposal closing date  specified in the solicitation.  There will not be a public bid opening. (8) Contractors that are Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment are  excluded from receiving contracts.  Agencies also shall not consent to  subcontract with such contractors.  Proposals prepared by Debarred, Suspended,  or otherwise ineligible contractors are at the risk and expense of the  contractor.

Accordingly, the solicitation is amended as follows:

1.	The proposal due date is hereby extended to 3:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time on Monday, 25 August 2003.

2.	Proposals shall be delivered electronically by e&#64979;mail to glarosr@nima.mil and michaelc@nima.mil, and by paper copy together with Compact Discs (CDs) containing sample database(s) delivered to National Imagery and Mapping Agency, ACME, MS D-5, Attn:  Rachel Glaros, 4600 Sangamore Road, Bethesda, MD 20816.

b.	All references to provisions and clauses beginning with 52 refer to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), all provisions and clauses beginning with 252 refers to the Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and all provisions and clauses beginning with 5X52 refers to the NIMA Acquisition Regulation Implementation (NARI);

c.	Under DFAR clause 252.212-7001, FAR clause 52.203-3 is applicable to this solicitation; and

d.	Clauses FAR 52,217-5 and FAR 52.217-9 are added to the
solicitation. (See paragraph 4q. below)

FAR 5217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (MAR 2000)  

(a)	The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Cotnractor within 30 days; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 60 days before the contract expires.  The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.  

(b)	If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.

(c)  The total duration of this contract, including all exercise of any 
     options under this clause shall not exceed 3 years.  

e.	Offerors are hereby advised that proposals may be evaluated by NIMA contractor support to include the MITRE Corporation, and that Contractors involved with the evaluation of proposals under this solicitation will be required to complete non-disclosure and non-compete agreements before evaluating proposals.

4.	Answers To Questions Received From Interested Parties

a. What Government Furnished Information (GFI) will be provided by NIMA?  To what extent must the contractor use the GFI as its reference data?  Please list the full range of files and data elements that will be included in the GFI.  Can another national transportation database be used to help with the geo-coding process, help populate the EMS Database and improve the accuracy of the feature data?  Does the GFI apply to all line items?

NIMA-provided GFI will include the NAVSTREETS Database (a commercial product; information regarding this product is available from Navigation Technologies Corporation, 222 Merchandise Mart Plaza, Suite 900, Chicago, IL  60654) and phone numbers and points of contact within the Department of Defense (DOD) for the DOD Medical Sector.  The contractor is not required to use the NAVSTREETS Database; however, the contractor is required to use an accurate transportation database in geo-coding. As stated in the solicitation, NIMA shall consider the accuracy of the contractor’s geo-coding process and transportation database used in making its award decision.  The GFI applies to line item 0003 only.  

b.	Must offerors propose all line items (that is, Line Items 0001, 0002 and 0003) to be considered for award?  Also, we have an existing database that provides some, but not all, of the required information; will NIMA consider proposals that do not include all desired line item components (for example, hospital helipads) for award?  

Offerors may propose one or more line items.  NIMA may award one or more contracts for each line item, or may make no award.  NIMA will determine which proposal, or combination of proposals, provide the best value to the Government, completeness, accuracy, cost and other factors considered.  Also if determined to be in the Government’s best interests, NIMA may consider proposals for less than complete line items.  Offerors are encouraged to propose existing databases to the extent such databases exist and to propose modifications to these databases to comply with stated requirements.  As stated in the solicitation, proposals of modified databases shall include a plan that describes the required modifications to the existing database, the qualifications and experience of the contractor’s technical team performing the modifications, the process for geo-coding the modifications, and the processes for validating and verifying the modifications prior to delivery.  Accordingly, offerors may propose all or some of the required line items; however, offerors are encouraged to propose complete line items.   

c.  The synopsis/solicitation requests that the proposal include a copy of the company’s license agreement; it also refers to the “purchase” of data.  Our agreements traditionally cover the licensing of data to customers, with licenses subject to annual renewal.  Is NIMA willing to consider the alternate approaches to licensing?  

Per the request for proposal the rights being sought include: “The contractor shall deliver the databases with a Federal Government license to include the unrestricted right to access, use, modify, reproduce, release (hardcopy products), perform, display, and/or otherwise disclose contents among the Federal Government and its contractors.  In time of emergency or crisis these rights shall be expanded to Non-Federal Government disaster/emergency response agencies and/or personnel.  As a costed option (separately priced line item), the contractor shall provide the unrestricted right to access, use, modify, reproduce, release (hardcopy products), perform, display, and/or otherwise disclose contents to Non-Federal Government disaster/emergency response agencies (e.g. state and local governments) when an emergency or crisis does not exist.” 

It is the intent of NIMA to purchase the data now and pay for quarterly updates on a yearly basis.

The company license agreement was requested to review any other terms and conditions that would apply to the data other than the minimum requirements specified by the Government stated above.  

d. Instead of a Federal wide license can line item 0002 be defined in terms of number of users for number of agencies?

Yes, a license that would allow for 1,000 users across 20 federal government agencies is needed.  However, in time of emergency or crisis these rights must be expanded to Non-Federal Government disaster/emergency response agencies and/or personnel.  

For the costed option for Non-Federal Government disaster/emergency response agencies (e.g. state and local governments) during a non-emergency, a price list that would allow NIMA to select the number of users and number agencies should be provided.

e. Please further define the following attribution-related elements:  “description of source” and “date of source”.

The terms “description of source” and “date of source” mean, for the purposes of this solicitation, a good description of the ancillary source material used to create the database and the year of that source to give a “pedigree” to the data in the database.  For example, source data found on the World Wide Web might read, “Source data 2003, Web Site WWW.…, Date of Download, Nov 23 2003, …”.  Thus, the “description of source” and “date of source” provides an indication of the currency and accuracy of the data.

f. Please clarify the following attributes:

(1)	“Metadata Link ID” – a computer “tag” that associates, within the database, the metadata about the data file to the data file itself.

(2)	“Zip code and Zip Code + 4” is stated as an integer, it must be a character - Actual Zip Code values are desired to be in the fields; if the zip code (example, "20162") or Zip Code + 4 (example, "20162-4855") require specific character types within the database, that is acceptable.  Changes to the attribute value are acceptable as long as the idea/information, and accessibility of the information is maintained.  Changes from the suggested formats and conventions are to be clearly outlined in the documentation provided with the data at time of delivery.

(3)	“NAICS Code” is stated as an integer, it must be a character - Changes to the attribute value are acceptable as long as the idea/information, and accessibility of the information is maintained.  Changes from the suggested formats and conventions are to be clearly outlined in the documentation provided with the data at time of delivery.

(4)	Attributes (e.g., under the Hospital sector, “# of Ambulance, # of Total Beds, and 24 Hr Service”) cannot have a number leading a field name - Changing attribute column headings as appropriate (example, "No. of Ambulance" or "Number of Ambulances") is acceptable as long as the idea/information and accessibility is maintained.  Changes from the suggested formats and conventions are to be clearly outlined in the documentation provided with the data at time of delivery.  Changes to the attribute value are acceptable as long as the idea/information and accessibility of the information is maintained.

g. We offer a number of additional value-added data elements beyond those defined in the synopsis/solicitation that we feel would further facilitate NIMA’s ability to perform its mission.  Are we to include these in our proposal or should we list them as costed options?  Also, what is meant by the term “costed option”?

As stated in the solicitation, “The minimum requirements for Items 0001 through 0003 are identified below; however, additional information contained in the database will be considered…”.  Offerors should separately price as option items any additional value-added data beyond minimum requirements.  Also, the term “costed option” should be interpreted to mean “a separately priced option item(s)”.

h.  Can NIMA provide a copy of the bidders list for this synopsis/solicitation?

NIMA did not formulate a bidders list prior to issuing this solicitation.  Since this is a full and open competition, NIMA is unable to identify potential sources until after proposals are received.  Accordingly, who NIMA cannot provide a copy of the bidders list.  

i. For line item 0002 does the Federal Government include National Laboratories and other Government-Owned/Contractor-Operated (GOCO) facilities?  

Yes; the National Laboratories and all GOCO facilities are included.  

j. The required accuracy cannot be achieved with a coordinate system that uses four decimal places.  Please clarify.

The minimum requirement for the Coordinate System is hereby revised to read:  Geographic Decimal Degrees (six decimal places).

k. Will there be any provision for payment before final delivery?

Offerors proposing modifications to existing databases (see the answers to question 2) may propose a delivery and payment schedule.  For example, offerors may propose a delivery date and value associated with delivery of the existing, unmodified database, then a delivery date and value associated with delivery of each modification/addition of feature group (e.g., hospital, police station, 911 Call Center, Evacuation Center, Fire Battalion Boundary, and Police Precinct Boundary data).  

l.  What sample database should be provided?  May the sample database include information beyond the minimum requirements?

For existing databases, offerors should provide for evaluation purposes only, a sample of the offered existing database.  NIMA will return the evaluation sample of the database after it completes its evaluation.  For modified databases, offerors should provide a sample of the existing database upon which the required database will be modeled; this database shall contain, to the maximum extent practicable, the same database structure and software tools as the required database offered.  NIMA will consider databases that are under development for the commercial marketplace but that have not as yet been sold commercially.  Samples shall be provided for the metropolitan areas of Detroit, Michigan and Houston, Texas, or such other metropolitan areas as may be mutually agreed upon by the offeror and NIMA (Rachel Glaros).

The sample should be a clip from the entire database (every single data element) on a CD in ESRI shape file format, not just the information that meets the minimum requirements.  As stated in the solicitation, NIMA will consider additional information contained in the database that supports special security events, crisis response, and comprehensive homeland security analysis and decision support.  A sample of the database is required for each line item.  

m.  For offerors proposing modifications to an existing database or databases currently in development, please describe the past performance information that is to be provided.

Offerors should identify three references (name, title, company name, and telephone number) who obtained and used the existing database within the past year.  Offerors proposing databases that are currently under development should propose three references (name, title, company name, and telephone number) for a database that has similar type of information about a different sector of the U.S. infrastructure.

n.  What is the anticipated contract award date?

Contract award will be made no later than 30 September 2003.

o.  Please state the evaluation factors and sub-factors and provide the respective weighting of factors and sub-factors.

NIMA is soliciting offers of commercial items and, therefore, is using Simplified Acquisition Procedures under FAR Part 13.  Pursuant to FAR 13.106&#64979;1(a)(2), NIMA may award one, multiple or no contracts based upon the offer or combination of offers that provide the best value to the Government.  NIMA will consider technical, price, and past performance in making its best value determination(s).  

p. Request the due date be extended by 10 business days.

The date and time for the submission of proposals are hereby extended to 3:00 P.M. EDT on Monday, 25 August 2003.  The Government intends to award one or more contracts no later than 30 September 2003.   

q.  What is the likelihood that NIMA will require updates more frequently than quarterly? (the RFP says “at least quarterly” – what does that mean?)  What is the likelihood that NIMA will require subsequent updates following the first year indicated in the contract? (the RFP indicates they “may be purchased at a later time.”) Should quarterly updates be priced separately?  

NIMA requires one year of quarterly updates to the databases.  There are no plans for the Government require more frequent updates; however, Offerors may propose more frequent database updates at no additional cost to the Government.   The price for the quarterly updates should be priced separately unless this is contradictory to standard commercial practices.  

Quarterly updates beyond the first year will depend on National priorities and the allocation of suitable funding to these efforts. Therefore, request that quarterly updates for two subsequent years following the initial one-year contract period be proposed as options to be exercised after contract award.  Each of the two subsequent years should be priced separately and within those years a separate price for a federal license as defined in the solicitation and a license that would allow access to Non-Federal Government disaster/emergency response agencies (e.g. State and local Governments, Red Cross, its contractors, etc.) during a non-emergency or crisis.   
 
r.  Can you give me a data layout of the open sources within the Federal Government and State Government, U.S. military services, private industry, and Government Furnished Information (GFI)?  The layouts would help us determine which attributes would need additional sources to meet the requirements.  

NIMA will only provide information on contacts within the Department of Defense for data related to DOD Medical Sector.

<DESC>The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Directorate, Ordnance Division, Energetic Materials Branch (MNME) seeks commercial quotations for a highly-specialized pulsed-laser spectroscopic diagnostic system.  The following paragraphs explain the minimum technical specifications/requirements for the spectroscopic detection component of this system, consisting of a multiple-grating spectrograph equipped with an intensified, gated, charge-coupled-device (IgCCD) detector, an electronic detector control unit, and data acquisition and analysis software.

Basic Configuration:  In this paragraph, system components to be provided by the vendor are discussed. Those to be provided by AFRL/MNME are identified as “government furnished equipment (GFE)”.  The GFE will not be made available to the vendor for testing.  The IgCCD detector will attach via a spectrometer mount to the spectrometer which contains a number of interchangeable diffraction gratings.  A camera adapter will also be provided to permit attaching the IgCCD detector to a standard F-mount bayonet style camera lens (GFE).  Vendor will supply any interface computer card required for communication between the IgCCD detector’s electronic control unit and an IBM-compatible personal computer (GFE).  This computer will run a Windows 2000 compatible software package to control the function of, and collect data from, the electronic control unit.  The system will include all power supplies, power cables, and control cables required for 110 VAC single phase 60 Hz operation.  

Mechanical Dimensions:  The IgCCD’s image intensifier photocathode will cover an approximately 25 x 7 mm rectangular area.  The image intensifier output will be fiber optically coupled to a CCD having at least 1000 x 250 pixels.  The spectrometer will have an input aperture ratio of approximately f/4, a minimum focal length of 250 mm, and will provide a wavelength dispersed image of the spectrometer input slit over a flat output focal plane large enough to overfill the IgCCD photocathode.
  
System Performance:  The system must be capable of recording spectra over the 200 to 800 nm wavelength range, with non-interchangeable components chosen to optimize performance over the 200 to 500 nm range.  Interchangeable diffraction gratings will be provided to permit recording spectra over approximately:  (a) 65 nm, 125 nm, and 250 nm wide regions anywhere in the 200 to 500 nm range, (b) 125 nm and 250 nm wide regions in the 500 to 800 nm range, and (c) a 500 nm region covering 300 to 800 nm.  The IgCCD detector will be capable of resolving at least 40 line-pairs per mm.  The IgCCD detector must be gateable to as short as 20 ns wide gates, with the electronic control unit providing for software selectable variable delays between an external TTL trigger signal and the start of the gate.  The IgCCD detector gate-on:gate-off contrast ratio will exceed 1,000,000:1 over the entire 200-800 nm region.  The IgCCD detector image intensifier phosphor recovery time must be compatible with data acquisition at 100+ Hz repetition rates.  The IgCCD detector will be thermoelectrically cooled, and must be hermetically sealed to avoid the need for an external dry gas purge.  The data acquisition software package will include provisions for manipulating the full 2-dimensional image data; including the capability of performing background subtractions, image ratioing, and calculation of the common logarithm.

Warranty and Hardware/Software User Manuals: Within your company’s quotation specify the terms of the standard warranty which your company offers with your system. Also, within your quote include pricing for all technical manuals necessary to operate the proposed hardware and software.   

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a quotation is being requested and a written request for quotation will not be issued. The reference number for this acquisition is F08630-03-M-0222. The government estimate for this procurement is $59,000.00.

The NWBC currently uses a variety of communications vehicles to fulfill its mission.  These include press releases, fact sheets, brochures, annual reports, research reports, issue briefs, a Web site (www.nwbc.gov), and an electronic newsletter.  The NWBC believes that by enhancing and coordinating the design of the materials, these communications tools can be further enhanced with an overall look that consistently reflects the Council’s integrity and values, yet also clearly conveys the information in an accessible manner.  Thus, the Council is seeking a business that can provide the following services:

STATEMENT OF WORK

Task Number One:  The contractor will meet with the NWBC to discuss the project plan, including the communications vehicles for which we will need a new design.  The contractor will receive current samples of each of these vehicles.  These samples will be used as a foundation for creating a more sophisticated image and identity for the NWBC.  The samples will include the NWBC’s Web site, www.nwbc.gov, the NWBC’s electronic newsletter, and the NWBC’s press releases, fact sheets, brochures, annual reports, research reports and issue briefs. 

Task Number Two:  The contractor will present several ideas for designs that might be used for the different communications vehicles.  

Task Number Three:  Building upon the approved designs from the previous presentation in task number two, the contractor will present near final designs for the communications vehicles.  

Task Number Four:  The contractor shall provide a new design for the Web site, www.nwbc.gov and will work with the Web site maintenance team to ensure the design is properly programmed into the site.  Elements of the Web site should include:
•	A “What’s New” section on the homepage.
•	“Contact the NWBC” information on the homepage.
•	The NWBC’s logo displayed prominently on the homepage and throughout the site.
•	An online poll section for the homepage (not yet in existence, but part of a future plan for the Web site).
•	A section for capturing the contact information of visitors who wish to be added to our database for future mailings (not yet in existence, but part of a future plan for the Web site).
•	A prominent section on the homepage for describing “Women’s Business Connection,” the NWBC’s monthly business conference call for women business owners.
•	Easy navigation tools for browsing through the Web site.
•	Different sections for such topics as:
o	Research
o	About the NWBC
o	Key Facts
o	Press Room
o	Other Publications
o	FAQ’s
o	Council Members
o	Links to Other Resources
o	Upcoming and Recent Events


DELIVERABLES  

The contractor shall provide the NWBC with designs for each of the NWBC’s communications vehicles as listed in task number one.  Stationery designs must include versions in a JPG format for convenient electronic use by NWBC staff.  Designs must also include a template for an electronic newsletter that can be embedded in the body of an e-mail, with instructions for editing the template for each new NWBC newsletter.  

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE  

The period of performance of this contract is 6 months from date of award.

REQUEST FOR QUOTATION

The successful offeror will respond to this request by:
•	Presenting relevant business experience and examples of similar work.
•	Offering a succinct proposal (no more than 10 pages), time-line and general cost-estimates for the aforementioned tasks.  The proposal should focus primarily on addressing the tasks listed in this document, but may also include suggestions for designs of other possible communications vehicles.  These additional suggestions should be listed separately in terms of the overall cost estimate for this project. 
•	Responding no later than two weeks from end of publication period in fedbiz.gov

<DESC>The RFP is modified as follows:
The time and date for receipt of proposals has been extended to:
10:00Am, Tuesday, September 2, 2003.
Request for Proposals
Commercial News USA

SECTION 1:  SUMMARY/BACKGROUND

This Request for Proposals (RFP) seeks proposals from contractors to be implemented at NO-COST to the U.S. Government, to implement the online and print export promotion products described below. 

Contractors are to be paid their costs and a reasonable profit out of program revenue generated.

The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service ("US&FCS" or "Commercial Service"), part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA), operates over 100 domestic Export Assistance Centers (EACs), and approximately 175 Commercial Posts in 78 countries overseas. US&FCS is statutorily mandated to promote U.S. exports by providing export promotion and facilitation services, products and programs to small-to-medium-sized U.S. business enterprises (SMEs).  US&FCS Commercial Officers and Specialists in our overseas posts, and Trade Specialists in our EACs in the United States, counsel U.S. firms, offer strategic export planning expertise, assist with trade event participation, and develop and deliver market intelligence and trade data on a cost-recovery fee basis. 

US&FCS services designed to assist SMEs and relevant to this solicitation include the following two periodicals:

Commercial News USA (CNUSA) is a monthly magazine that promotes U.S. exports around the world to buyers, distributors, and representatives in more than 145 countries.  This widely-read publication is currently distributed outside the United States, free of charge to foreign importers and businesses through U.S. Embassies, Consulates, and trading partners worldwide.  The magazine has been published for more than 20 years and has a companion Web site - www.cnewsusa.com.  The contract between US&FCS and the current private sector publisher of CNUSA will expire on September 30, 2003.  US&FCS seeks at this juncture to produce the CNUSA magazine and discontinue the www.cnewsusa.com website.  The contract resulting from this RFP may be extended by amendment to include the marketing of BuyUSA.com at a date yet to be determined.  

BuyUSA.com is a Government-to-Business (G2B) website intended to assist U.S. SMEs in the location of qualified international buyers and trading partners.  In the near future, the site will offer to users the ability to create a product/service brochure or catalog, interactive connection to promising trading partners, and a variety of educational information and guidance on conduct of international business.  BuyUSA.com membership is available to U.S. exporters under a tiered system.  Basic listings on the site are available for roughly $50 while enhanced listings will be available for a more significant fee. All fees will be determined on a cost-recovery basis.  

Qualified potential foreign buyers of U.S. exports are allowed to register free of charge, leading to robust foreign traffic on the site.  This is a major selling point in the eyes of potential U.S. companies. 

The BuyUSA service and program is specifically structured to integrate US&FCS and other internet-based service delivery with the unique global physical network of US&FCS field offices, offering BuyUSA.com users direct access to and assistance from experienced US&FCS Trade Specialists and Commercial Officers with expertise in all major industry sectors/subsectors, and in all major country and regional markets worldwide. The BuyUSA.com website is fully owned by US&FCS, and is located at http://www.BuyUSA.com.

US&FCS also owns BuyUSA.gov, a series of Web sites that showcase international trade service providers (e.g., freight forwarders, interpreters, local law firms) available to help U.S. companies' export to a specific country.  For example, BuyUSA.gov/Switzerland lists Swiss business service providers that can help U.S. exporters in the Swiss market.  BuyUSA.gov is linked to BuyUSA.com.

SECTION 2:  SCOPE, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE

This solicitation seeks a contractor to produce and distribute the magazine.  Specifically, the contractor will be responsible for:
1)	selling listings and display ads to U.S. companies;
2)	copy writing and editing of listings; 
3)	camera copy production and making electronic version (.PDF) of the magazine available electronically; 
4)	printing;
5)	distribution; and 
6)	customer service.

At a later date, the contract resulting from this RFP may be amended to include the marketing of BuyUSA.com to U.S. exporters and international trade service providers.  Please note that the site maintenance for BuyUSA.com and BuyUSA.gov is handled through a separate, existing contract.

This solicitation seeks proposals as described above from U.S. firms that:
"	Currently produce and distribute a magazine or similar publication;
"	Currently market print advertisements in magazines;
"	Currently facilitate the buying, selling, or promoting U.S. goods and services; or 
"	Currently promote and/or facilitate the export of goods and services from the United States.

US&FCS is seeking business proposals from firms interested in providing contract services to US&FCS to structure and implement value added, print and internet based export promotion/facilitation tools to primarily benefit small- to medium-sized U.S. exporters.

US&FCS specifically does NOT seek to fund the activities covered by this RFP, but rather seeks proposals in which contractor produces and distributes the print version of CNUSA and recovers its costs and a reasonable profit from program revenue generated by these products.  Thus, services or capabilities are to be proposed at NO COST to US&FCS.  Respondents are encouraged to propose creative marketing strategies but are directed to review Office of Management and Budget circular A-25 regarding the government mandate for full cost recovery.  Generally, under Circular A-25, US&FCS must fully recover the costs of services it provides to identifiable recipients. We are open to creative partnering agreements with other groups that might be interested in promoting or distributing the magazine.

Proposals should, ideally, generate sufficient revenue to share between US&FCS and the contractor so that US&FCS recovers the costs it incurs related to the subject programs and the contractor recovers its costs and a reasonable profit.  

SECTION 3:  PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

Offerors shall propose a comprehensive marketing/sales strategy that ensures "critical mass" for CNUSA.  Specific duties include:

a.	Promotion - The contractor shall use its market research, budget, channels of distribution and schedules to develop and, with the cooperation of US&FCS field offices, implement a domestic promotional campaign for CNUSA.  We anticipate that the vast majority of advertising revenue will be generated by the contractor's sales staff.  

b.	Copy Writing - The contractor shall be responsible for writing and editing listings from materials it receives from qualified clients, ensuring that what is written, accurately describes the product or service in a manner that facilitates comprehension by potential overseas importers whose native language may be other than English.

c.	Production - The contractor shall, with US&FCS oversight, determine the cover design, editorial format, style and content, graphics, feature articles, etc., for CNUSA.  Also, using established DOC industry codes, the contractor shall determine the industry category of individual "listings" that shall appear in each issue.

d.	Layout - The contractor shall be responsible for producing the camera copy layout for the final printing of each issue.  The contractor shall publish individual "listings" promptly within a period not to exceed 45 days from any given issue's closing date.

e.	Printing - The contractor shall use its own resources and facilities, either in-house or on a subcontract basis, to print the appropriate number of copies up to 80,000, of CNUSA for each of the no less than six (6) issues that are to be published annually.  The current publication schedule includes 11 issues per year.

f.	Distribution - the contractor shall distribute appropriate quantities of each issue of CNUSA to all distributing posts and eligible domestic recipients in a timely manner.  The contractor shall be authorized and may at its option elect to use (a) its own resources and facilities, either in-house or on a subcontract basis, to distribute CNUSA; or (b) distribution methods currently offered by US&FCS and described below.  Regardless of the circulation for CNUSA, US&FCS shall receive, at no charge, no less than fifty (50) copies of each issue.

g.	The contractor shall make a .PDF version of the magazine available on BuyUSA.com and setting up an electronic email system to notify clients when each new issue is available.

Current Distribution is made by: (a) Diplomatic Pouch; (b) Military Postal Service (APO/FPO); and private sector vendor.  The current distribution charges are estimated at roughly $50,000 per issue for 120,000 copies, but please note that such charges may change.  Under this solicitation, we anticipate distributing significantly fewer e.g. approximately 50,000 -80,000 copies, and respondents are strongly encouraged to develop cost-saving strategies and partnership arrangements for the distribution of the print magazine.  Please note that simply providing the magazine in an electronic format is not currently an acceptable strategy for overseas distribution because many of our recipients are not Internet enabled.

The contractor shall notify the Department of all subcontractors, including printing and distribution subcontractors, providing services under this contract prior to the first issue of CNUSA that involves any subcontractor.  If the contractor elects to employ Department of Commerce distribution channels, the Department will provide the contractor with distribution invoices within eight weeks of the shipment date and the contractor shall reimburse the Department for all costs within 30 days of receiving the invoice.

The contractor shall, on a semi-annual basis, assess and report to US&FCS, the effectiveness of CNUSA.


SECTION 4:  DELIVERY SCHEDULE/DELIVERABLES

Contractor Deliverables
The contractor shall have its sales force operational within one month of contract signing.  The first issue of the magazine shall be published and distributed within 90 days of contract signing.

US&FCS Deliverables
US&FCS will, as relevant and appropriate, provide contractor with contact information for current online and print advertisers upon contract award.  US&FCS will also provide current marketing materials, training materials and other information deemed relevant to the program.

SECTION 5:  RELEVANT INFORMATION 

In order to assist firms considering or preparing a response to this solicitation, the following areas are of interest to US&FCS in its relationship with the contractor, with further details to be articulated in the ensuing contract.  
 
a)	Sales/Marketing:  Proposals should articulate an effective sales/marketing strategy to populate CNUSA.  Proposals should articulate how the contractor will generate enough revenue to ensure that the program is commercially viable.

b)	Cost Recovery:  US&FCS is required to charge sufficient costs for its services to recover its costs of developing and implementing said services.  Respondents should develop their own budgets regarding sales staffs, layout and printing costs, distribution, and other expenses.  Revenue sharing proposals should be developed by the bidder for print advertisements sold by the contractor and those sold by US&FCS personnel keeping in mind that current distribution cost of $50,000 per issue should be substantially cut and shall be borne entirely by the winning offeror.

c)	Applicability of USG Statutes, Policies and Audit/Review:  All project financial systems, operations and procedures shall comply with applicable Federal and U.S. Department of Commerce statutes (e.g. see US&FCS statute below), regulations, standards and policies, and shall be subject to Commerce and General Accounting Office audit.  US&FCS will perform quarterly review of the project's operations and revenues. 

d)	Pricing: US&FCS is statutorily mandated to focus on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given the price sensitivity of SMEs, proposed prices for the project's services for 1/9 page ad must be agreed upon by US&FCS and the contractor to ensure that the prices are reasonable for the U.S. SME client base, while meeting the needs of both US&FCS and its contractors.

e)	Intellectual Property Provisions:  With respect to all content prepared by or for contractor under this Agreement, such as articles, collections of data, graphics, Web design, charts, and all other materials, the US&FCS will reserve the right to own, via assignment or otherwise, any works on which copyright is claimed by the contractor or its agent(s), ultimately resulting in copyright being owned by USFCS, to the extent permissible by law.

Property Rights: Although US&FCS and the contractor shall work jointly to produce the publication, it is understood that the name, title, and logotype of Commercial News USA, BuyUSA, and the U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service shall remain the property of the United States Government, as shall, in the case of logotypes, any reasonable resemblance thereto.  Similarly, the US&FCS will own all newly created domain names and trademarks arising under this Agreement.  Both parties recognize that the current Commercial News USA and BuyUSA client and/or subscriber mailing lists are, and shall continue to be, the property of the United States Government.  Any advertiser list developed exclusively by the contractor shall be the property of the contractor, but provided this or subsequent contracts are in effect, the contractor shall, on a monthly basis, provide US&FCS full access to such lists, at no charge to US&FCS, for US&FCS's own uses.

Liabilities:  US&FCS will require the contractor to maintain adequate insurance in the event of any disputes arising from use of CNUSA by customers. 

Confidentiality Agreement:  The contractor and its employees or other associates under this contract must be willing, if appropriate, to sign confidentiality agreements.

Additional Information

Contract Award and Implementation.  Selection will be made by US&FCS based on (1) assessment of offeror responses against criteria provided above; and (2) direct discussions between US&FCS and offerors addressing business programmatic, technical and business aspects of contract. 

(2) Any firm currently publishing a similar Department of Commerce publication or engaging in a similar export promotion activity (e.g. publication or on-line marketing) may be considered to have an organizational conflict of interest as defined by FAR 9.5 and if so would not be considered for this award. The winning firm may be not be eligible for future contracts or other arrangements with the Department of Commerce for similar publishing or export promotion activity that would create conflicts with this CNUSA
contract.  This prohibition would be in place so long as this contract for CNUSA is in effect.

SECTION 6:  PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE

The initial term of the resulting contract will be for a period of two (2) years with options for three (3) one-year periods based upon satisfactory performance.  The place of performance will be the contractor's place of business.

<DESC>This is a follow-on to Announcement 3078 dated May 2, 2003.  Based on=  responses received, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determin= ed to narrow potential offerors to Small Businesses located within a 50-mil= e radius of the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center (MMAC) at the time of thi= s announcement.  This limited geographical requirement is based on the cons= iderable amount of time the contractor will be required to spend at the MMA= C.  The contractor will interact on a daily basis with the Program Director=  of the FAA Logistics Center (FAALC), managers, and organizations.=20 The FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) Business Declaration form (Atta= chment 1) is required to be completed, signed, and submitted with your resp= onse to this SIR1. The FAA, MMAC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, has a requirement to obtain writer = and editor services for the FAALC.  The FAALC will utilize editor/writer se= rvices to market its products and services. The purpose of this requirement=  is to give the FAALC the capability to craft compelling ad text, develop p= rofessional brochure text, communicate to its customers, and prepare polish= ed, professional communication materials for its employees.  The writer/edi= tor will be required to write brochures and descriptions of the FAALC progr= ams and capabilities, prepare and submit applications for national and agen= cy awards, and develop proposals and briefings as described in the attached=  draft Statement of Work (SOW), Attachment 2. The FAA contemplates the use of an Indefinite-Delivery/Requirements type co= ntract with time-and-material pricing arrangement and use of task orders.  = The resultant contract has a potential duration of four (4) years including=  a base 1-year period with three (3) 1-year options to be exercised at the = sole discretion of the government. =20 This acquisition will use streamlined acquisition procedures employing best=  practices for competitive negotiated procurements as authorized by the Fed= eral Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (AMS) of 1997.  = Offers will be evaluated and contract award made on the basis of "Best Valu= e to the FAA".  Best Value is defined as the Government's willingness to pa= y more for a superior proposal if there are added benefits, which justify t= he additional cost. This acquisition contemplates a phased approach.  This initial phase involv= es the announcement/SIR1 of the requirement in order to permit vendors to d= emonstrate their capabilities.  Evaluations involved in SIR1 will permit th= e FAA to down-select to a manageable number, not to exceed five (5), of off= ers permitting an efficient competition from among the most highly rated su= bmissions.  SIR2 will incorporate the evaluation accomplished under SIR1 as=  well as evaluation of oral presentations with contract award based on over= all best value to the FAA.  The remaining phase(s) of the down-select proce= ss will be identified in future communications with those firms who are amo= ng the top five (5).   =20 Vendors that are interested and possess certain capabilities are to provide=  the specific information described below as to their unique capabilities t= o be brought to the performance of this requirement.  The specific informat= ion provided must be accurate and complete because it will be used to deter= mine each vendor's eligibility to participate.

8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

BACKGROUND:

The USAID/Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is a regional USAID Mission with responsibility for the development and management of the U.S. Government’s assistance program for the five Central Asian Republics.  This program is directed at supporting a program of policy reform, humanitarian assistance, economic recovery, democratic and social transition in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

Tajikistan poses one of the most difficult development challenges in the region.  This small isolated country was already the poorest of the republics when part of the Soviet Union, but civil war and economic collapse since independence have now reduced over 80% of the population to poverty.  The country has begun to see a political and economic turnaround since peace accords were signed in 1997.  Tajikistan is on the front line of pressing U.S. concerns in the region: narcotics and persons trafficking and terrorism, Islamic extremism, democratic transition, economic reform, and management of region's vast water resources.  USAID assistance to the country initially focused on urgent humanitarian needs and supporting the peace process.  Under the new assistance strategy for Central Asia, USAID is increasingly supporting the country’s longer-term development needs, while still meeting humanitarian needs.  

In the fall of 1998, relocation of the U.S. Ambassador to Tajikistan and all U.S. employees from Dushanbe to Almaty, Kazakhstan limited USAID's capacity to support the development change. The security situation has improved to the point that a new U.S. Embassy is under construction and U.S. Government employees, including the USAID/CAR Tajikistan Country Program Officer, travel for extended temporary duty assignments in Tajikistan.  With the opening of the U.S. Embassy in 2004, all U.S. Government staff assigned to Tajikistan may be assigned there on a full time basis.
The Development Assistance Specialist would be resident on a limited basis in Almaty, Kazakhstan but be on long term temporary duty assignment in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, consistently with the U.S. Government’s security and staffing policies.  In the event that the new U.S, embassy opens in 2004 and staff are assigned to Tajikistan full time, the present position may be transferred full time to Dushanbe. 
Please note:  Currently, this is an unaccompanied position (i.e., members of the incumbent’s household or family can not accompany the incumbent to Kazakhstan or Tajikistan).

BASIC FUNCTION:  

Serves as a professional Development Assistance Specialist, performing responsible work associated with delivering, monitoring and evaluating U.S. development assistance programs to Tajikistan.  Also serves as deputy to the USAID/CAR Tajikistan Country Program Officer, who manages the USAID program in the Republic of Tajikistan.  Work is performed primarily in the Republic of Tajikistan, but the incumbent is expected to participate in assignments throughout the Central Asian Region. The incumbent coordinates activities in all sectors (democracy and conflict mitigation, health and education, enterprise and finance, energy and water, humanitarian and social-sector programs) within the Republic of Tajikistan, at the level described below, and specifically performs the following major duties and responsibilities:

Performs other duties as assigned.	

POSITION ELEMENTS:

Factor 1-7 Knowledge Required by the Position
Knowledge of program principles and procedures applicable to a wide range of duties in one or more program and/or functional areas, and a high level of skill in applying this knowledge in solving complex problems involving diverse aspects of development assistance programs/projects (e.g. performing investigations, or oversight activities of greater than average difficulty, as in a new program or a program that is being redefined, where procedures require frequent modification and change in order to incorporate revised theories and techniques); modifying or adapting established methods and procedures or making significant departures from previous approaches to solve similar problems; revising standard methods to improve or extend management systems; and evaluating, modifying, or adapting new methods to meet the requirements of particular situations. Knowledge of statutes, regulations, requirements, and precedent decisions governing program/project operations sufficient to use in planning, implementing, or monitoring development assistance programs and services (e.g., determining needs, evaluating program effectiveness, assuring compliance with regulations).  Management, and administrative knowledge and skill sufficient to provide advisory, reviewing, evaluating, educating and/or training, negotiating, or problem-solving services (as a ''troubleshooter,'' specialist, or coordinator) on specific problems, projects, programs, or functions (e.g., developing, coordinating, reviewing, and evaluating the implementation of scopes of work, including estimates of staffing needs, equipment, and supplies, and detailed instructions necessary to carry out plans).

Factor 2-4 Supervisory Controls
The supervisor sets the overall assignment objectives, program emphasis, and resources available. The Development Assistance Specialist and supervisor, in consultation, develop the deadlines, projects, and work to be done.  The Development Assistance Specialist, having developed expertise in a particular program or functional area, has continuing responsibility for independently planning and carrying out important development assistance programs or projects; determining the approach to be taken and the methods to be used; resolving most of the conflicts that arise; coordinating the work with others as necessary; and interpreting policy in terms of established objectives.  The Specialist keeps the supervisor informed of progress, potentially controversial matters, and problems with far-reaching implications.  Completed work is reviewed for conformance to overall requirements, compatibility with other work, and effectiveness in meeting objectives.

Factor 3-3 Guidelines
Guidelines are available, including standard references, handbooks and procedural manuals, ADS Chapters, FAM, FAR, and textbooks and other resources of the field; Federal regulations relating to development programs; and agency regulations and directives. Guidelines are not always completely applicable to specific work assignments, but precedent materials are available for reference (e.g., development reports, plans, and records illustrative of similar projects or assignments). The Development Assistance Specialist uses judgment in choosing, interpreting, and adapting guidelines and precedents to specific issues or problems in accordance with established policies and accepted practice; researching regulations and determining the relationship between the guidelines and USG and Agency needs and requirements; and in recommending changes to procedures to improve the reliability of data, enhance services, correct deficiencies, etc.

Factor 4-4 Complexity
The work typically involves full responsibility for well-established aspects of one or more development programs/projects and/or functional areas and includes a wide variety of duties involving diverse and complex technical and/or program or administrative problems and considerations.  Decisions regarding what needs to be done depend on the assessment of unusual facts or conditions.  Variations in approach depend upon the development and political setting, available resources, impact on the Mission and the host-government, etc.; and incomplete or conflicting data (e.g., inadequate program information from contractors or grant applicants, new methodologies or new programs for which only a minimum of information is available). The work requires making many decisions concerning such things as interpreting considerable data, planning the work, refining existing criteria, or extending or modifying conventional methods and techniques.

Factor 5-3 Scope and Effect
The purpose of the work is to plan and carry out a variety of development assistance projects or programs or to improve the process for analysis of project and country-specific constraints to development. The work involves identifying, analyzing, and making recommendations to resolve conventional compliance problems with development assistance projects, and situations that are covered by established precedents and procedures. Assignments may include portions of broader activities or complete projects of limited scope. The work affects the success of USAID development assistance programs/projects, the adequacy of such activities as progress reviews; research/study conclusions; or, through the success of programs/projects, the well-being of persons in affected regions or communities.

Factor 6-3 Personal Contacts
The persons contacted include persons from outside USAID in a moderately unstructured setting. Typical of contacts at this level are those with persons in their capacities as contractors, attorneys, company executives, host-country officials, or representatives of other Federal agencies, professional organizations, or organized or ad hoc groups. This level may also include contacts with high-level Agency or program officials, several managerial levels removed from the employee, when such contacts occur on an ad-hoc basis.

Factor 7-2 Purpose of Contacts
The purpose of contacts is to plan or coordinate work efforts or to resolve operating problems by influencing or motivating individuals or groups who are working toward mutual goals and who have basically cooperative attitudes (e.g., discussing contract requirements or resolving problems with contractors; advising others on the need for or the results of evaluations; discussing program/project progress).

Factor 8-1 Physical Demands
The work is primarily sedentary, although some physical effort may be required, e.g., walking, standing, carrying light items such as manuals or briefcases, or driving or traveling by motor vehicle.

Factor 9-1 Work Environment
The work environment involves everyday risks or discomforts that require normal safety precautions typical of such places as offices, training rooms, and libraries. The work area is adequately lighted, heated, and ventilated. There may be occasional exposure to moderate risks or during program/project and country visits.

<ARCHDATE>08182004
<CONTACT>HARLAN JOHNSON CONTRACT SPECIALIST 2084335025     harlan_johnson@oas.gov;
<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) solicits responses from firms currently involved in the aerial disbursement of fire retardant materials and firms interested in future opportunities to perform such operations for the Federal Land Management Agencies.  The submitted information will be used by the involved agencies to assist managers in the formation of future contract requirements for air tankers.  After a determination has been made regarding contract requirements and appropriate levels of funding are available for the selected approach, a Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued.  The RFP will be solicited under full and open competition and result in a "Best Value" award. Background: In 2002, the federal wildfire suppression agencies experienced aircraft and crew losses that led to an analysis of the status of the private sector airtanker fleet. It was determined that the fleet was aging, in need of replacement and/or modernization, and that further acquisition of military surplus airframes was not justified. Further, it was determined that continued dependence on converted military aircraft merely deferred the development of modern aircraft purpose built for the aerial fire suppression role, and served to discourage technological advancement.  The federal agencies (USDA Forest Service & USDOI Bureau of Land Management) are actively seeking resolution to these issues in two ways: 1.	Currently contracted fleet replacement- Proposals for next generation fixed-wing aerial suppression platforms range from less than 1,000gallon capacity to over 20,000 gallons.   Proposals for eventual replacement should be limited to modern fixed wing, turbine powered aircraft.  2.	Currently contracted fleet modernization - Certain makes and models of aircraft currently in use may be candidates for modernization. Proposals for modernization of specific models should also specify turbine power and provide 15 to 20 years of extended service life. Interested parties may obtain additional information at the following location: http://205.173.2.6/oassol.nsf/C0F5F6BAC620854E87256D87005A4695/$FILE/RFI.pdf

<DESC>Signage Services - SSA Operations Building
NAICS 339950 Sign Manufacturing
The SSA Operations Building, a four story and half a basement facility, will be undergoing extensive renovations starting in September 2003.  The duration of the Operations Building Renovation Project will be approximately 3.5 years and will be in two phases of construction.  Phase one renovations of the west side will take approximately 18 months.     After that section is finished, employees can start moving in and work will begin on the east side of the building. There are six months allotted between phases to backfill the west half of the building and vacate the east half.  Phase two of the east side is scheduled to take 16 months.  The building size is 790,000 NSF.    
The building renovations will include, but will not be limited to, new cubicles (approximately 2600), offices, office suites, and conference rooms, self service supply store, post office, library, concession stands, specialty stores and employee activity centers.
There will be four main building entrances, one on the south side, two on the east side, and once on the west side.  Easy way finding as defined by workplace neighborhoods is required.
 
SSA will need signage throughout the entire building for the following sign types:
1.	Code Signs
2.	Egress Signs
3.	Safety/regulation signs
4.	column markers
5.	general building signs
6.	special condition signs
7.	Tenant sign for Suite
8.	Tenant sign for Offices
9.	Support room signs
10.	cubical and cubicle row signs
11.	Way finding signs for directional signs
12.	Building identity signs
13.	key location hanging signs
14.	link signage

The signage project will be scheduled for completion to coordinate with the two construction phases.  Since employees will be unable to relocate to the Operations Building newly renovated space until all of the appropriate signs are in place, prompt installation of the signs is critical.  Employees located on the east side of the building will be unable to relocate to the west side of the building until all of the signs are in place.  It is imperative that the contractor adheres to the delivery schedule.  If the Contractor fails to deliver the supplies or perform the services within the time specified in the contract, the Contractor will pay to the Government liquidated dames of $1,000 per calendar day of delay.

The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to ascertain the number of small business MANUFACTUERS who are interested and capable to perform the above requirement.  Refer to Federal Acquisition Regulation 19.502-2 (c)  i.e., For small business set-asides…any concern proposing to furnish a product that it did not itself manufacture MUST furnish the product of a small business manufacturer…Interested small business manufacturers should respond within 15 calendar days from the issuance date of this sources sought synopsis that they are a small business manufacturer and submit complete information about their capabilities.  Only written responses will be accepted and must clearly state the ability to provide the services e.g., information detailing their experience, past performance, duties, number and types of projects providing signs similar to the size and complexities of the SSA Operations Building.  Projects submitted for review should be limited to those being currently performed or completed within the previous 3 years.  No cost or pricing data is required or requested.  This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for the information solicited or received.  Acknowledgement of receipt will not be issued, nor will respondents be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received.

<DESC>RESEARCH PROGRAM ON DAMAGE OF MATERIAL UNDER HIGH ENERGY IMPACT.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the  authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(i). The proposed source  is Dr. George Voyiadjis, Louisiana State University.  The non-personal service  being procured is for the contractor to plan, organize, and conduct a research  program to investigate the damage of material under high energy impact,  including characterization of the dissipation of energy by including elastic- viscoelastic material response.   The algorithms developed will be of such a  nature that they may be included in a finite element code leading to a better  understanding of the high energy impact phenomenon called gouging.  The work is  to be performed at the contractor’s location.  Period of performance is 15 Sep  2003 through 14 Sep 2004.  This synopsis is being published for information  purposes only. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive  quotations; however, any quotations received within six (6) days of the  issuance of this notice will be considered by the government.  A determination  by the government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to  this notice is solely within the discretion of the government.  Information  received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining  whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Any quotations should be e- mailed to Susie Slivinski at Susie.Slivinski@wpafb.af.mil or faxed to 937-257- 3926 no later than 25 August 2003.
