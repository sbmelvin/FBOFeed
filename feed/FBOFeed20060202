<DESC>SYNOPSIS FOR CURRENT CONTRACT DG1350-05-CN-1082: CHANGE IN SCOPE


The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Office of Travel and Tourism requires continued contractor services for the support of a process to administer a monthly In-Flight Survey of International Travelers.  This survey provides statistical market data about the international air passenger travel market.  This is a notice for a change in scope of the current contract DG1350-05-CN-1082.

The current contract is held by CIC Research Inc, of San Diego, California.  CIC Research Inc has conducted all survey activities for this project since 1985.  Currently, the Period of Performance of this contract is set to end on 15 May 2006.

The data collected by this survey reflects the characteristics of the international travel population, with the collections proportionately coming from markets for inbound travel as well as destinations visited by U.S. travelers abroad.  This survey is the sole source for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates for travel and passenger fare exports and imports, as well as multiple other Federal and private sector industry clients.  Quarterly estimates are produced from the survey based on reporting of monthly samples. By distributing the sample throughout each month of the quarter, the seasonal variances in travel patterns are reflected in the survey.  Due to the seasonal travel patterns of international travelers, the third quarter tends to be the largest survey period.  

This acquisition will be re-competed exclusively for small business concerns under authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.203.  A solicitation will be posted to this Government wide point of entry on or about Tuesday, 21 February, 2006.  However, weighting of the monthly sampling data requires consistency in methodology within the calendar year reported.  Therefore, this synopsis announces a change in scope of the current contract to extend the collection of data throughout 30 September, 2006 (the end of the third quarter), with all data processing and reporting services ending 31 December 2006.  

Additionally, this synopsis announces an added Option to extend the collection of data throughout the end of the Calendar Year 2006, with all reporting services ending 30 July 2007.  Due to the lag time between the monthly survey operations and the production of the data reports, this end date will allow the contractor time to process all of the 2006 data and generate the annual reports.  Extension of these services will provide for continued reporting based on data collected without risk of a delay in the data collection during the contractor transition following award of the new contract.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS FOR SOLICITATION DG1350-06-RP-0029


The Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration, Office of Travel and Tourism requires contractor services for the development and support of a process to administer a monthly In-Flight Survey of International Travelers. Competed in accordance with FAR Part 15. This survey will provide statistical market data about the international air passenger travel market.  This is a pre-solicitation notice.

The data collected by this survey reflects the characteristics of the international travel population, with the collections proportionately coming from markets for inbound travel as well as destinations visited by U.S. travelers abroad.  This survey is the sole source for the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) estimates for travel and passenger fare exports and imports, as well as multiple other Federal and private sector industry clients.  Quarterly estimates are produced from the survey based on reporting of monthly samples. By distributing the sample throughout each month of the quarter, the seasonal variances in travel patterns are reflected in the survey.  Due to the seasonal travel patterns of international travelers, the third quarter tends to be the largest survey period.  

This acquisition is set aside exclusively for small business concerns under authority of Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.203.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541910 and the related size standard is $6.0 million.  A solicitation will be posted to this Government wide point of entry on or about Tuesday, 21 February, 2006.  The Government estimates a fixed price contract to be awarded based on competition for one twelve month period and four twelve month option periods.  The estimated level of effort based on historical experience is 70,000-95,000 respondents per year.  There is considerable demand for a much larger sample, and potential contractors will be encouraged to develop strategies and methods to increase the sample of the program given financial constraints due to funding available.  

The Government foresees holding a pre-proposal conference for this acquisition approximately mid-March, during which potential contractors may obtain better understanding of the work required.  Further details relating to date, time, and location will be included in the solicitation.  Further information on the In-Flight Survey program can be found at the OTTI website: http://tinet.ita.doc.gov/research/programs/ifs/index.html

The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  Background: The Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, requires the development of  documentation of algorithms related to exposures in utero, in infancy, or early childhood that may be associated with a woman’s risk of adult cancer using data from mothers, who reported information to the contractor about prenatal, postnatal, and early childhood events in a retrospective cohort design.  Maternal data were linked to two ongoing, large-scale prospective cohort studies, known as the Nurses’ Health Study I and II, including 40,000 nurses, who have reported data on recognized risk factors for cancer and who are being followed for diagnosis of incident cancers as well as mortality.  In collaboration with the Department of Nutrition, Harvard School of Public Health and the Channing Laboratory, Brigham Woman’s Hospital, the LBC has collected data to examine the role of hormonal exposures in early life and its relation to cancer incidence in a prospective study after adjustment for recognized risk factors for cancer. The Contractor shall develop the files, the documentation, and perform the internal validity programming and tabulations.   Period of Performance: Three (3) months from date of award.  Harvard University School of Public Health is the only known source that can provide the aforementioned requirements.  The contractor has as its Chair of the Department of Nutrition, a Principal Investigator who was a member of the original study team to initiate this cohort study and successfully maintain follow-up of the nurse daughters once every two years. The Principal Investigator has been affiliated with data collection, cleaning and editing of the Maternal Cohort Study.  This affiliation is required to enable the contractor to engage in the analysis and develop a linked file with the maternal replies and nurse daughter replies to the study specific questionnaires in an agreed upon fashion with the NCI project officer.  The expertise and experience of the Harvard University is required for development of the algorithms and that will also assure continued excellent follow-up of the nurse daughters for incident disease endpoints for this study.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The capability statement and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can fully meet the requirements herein.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 11:00 AM EST on February 17, 2006.  If you have any questions, please submit them in writing via electronic mail to Karen Gardner, Contract Specialist on gardnerka@mail.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received shall be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Nashville District intends to issue a Lump Sum Fixed Price CONTRACT FOR PLANNING AND DESIGN SERVICES, Nashville, TN.  The NAICS code for this solicitation will be 541330.  The SIC Code will be 8711. Contract Information Groups with prime-sub relationships or joint ventures will be considered as well as firms having all disciplines in-house.  Responding groups or firms must have demonstrated competence, creativity and experience in urban planning and waterfront redevelopme nt with an emphasis on urban revitalization, historic preservation, park/recreation planning and water use and access in an urban setting.  The estimated cost of this phase of the project is less than $325,000.  It is anticipated to be awarded in May 2006. Project Information The project includes completion of Phase II of the Nashville Riverfront Redevelopment Master Plan.  It will consist of preparation of a Conceptual Development Plan (CDP) for riverfront redevelopment on each side of the three miles of the Cumberland River i n downtown Nashville. (The project area is defined by Rolling Mill Hill to Metro Center on the west bank and Shelby Park to the I-65 bridge on the east bank.) It will build on publicly-defined expectations for the study area established through a series of  public meetings held in the first phase of the project, Phase I Visioning, which has been completed.  The CDP will provide detailed inventory and analysis of existing conditions and develop detailed concepts based on those findings for the Nashville river front.   The CDP will address issues related to ecosystem restoration, shoreline preservation, critical view shed preservation, public water access, land use/zoning, economic redevelopment, and creating an attractive, lively riverfront unique to the Nashville conte xt. The CDP will detail amenities and activities for public enjoyment and appreciation of the Cumberland River and include recommendations for specific public and private development within the study area linked to the riverfront and surrounding residentia l areas by pedestrian-friendly corridors and connections.  Recommendations regarding development guidelines, land acquisition strategies, and available or potential funding sources are also sought. The CDP will build upon and be consistent with riverfront goals and concepts established in the 2005 Plan of Nashville, 2002 Parks & Greenways Master Plan, and the illustrative concept of the riverfront prepared by Wallace, Roberts & Todd for the Metropolitan Government (all are available at www.civicdesigncenter .org/riverfront). The CDP will recommend priority projects and phases for riverfront redevelopment; provide general cost estimates for the phases; and, provide schematic drawings for a minimum of two site-specific highest priority areas of the plan. These areas should repre sent a public or public/private development opportunity that may serve as the initial step in implementation of the overall conceptual master plan. Detailed costs should be provided for these sites to allow for proper budgeting for further design developme nt and construction.   To continue public involvement, a minimum of two public presentations should be held to convey design ideas at the preliminary and final master plan stages. The preliminary master plan meeting should be for the purposes of soliciting public reaction to the  preliminary master plan and gaining additional public input for incorporation into the final master plan. A final public presentation of the master plan concept for the riverfront should be held complete with probable cost estimates and phasing recommenda tions.  Firms and/or teams interested in responding to this Request for Qualifications are invited to attend an informational meeting on Thursday, February 16, 2006 from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. at the Nashville Civic Design Center located at 138 Second Avenue North, Su ite 106, Nashville, Tennessee 37201.

These services are  currently being performed by SAIC under Department of Energy Contract  Number DE-AM01-00SO20050, which will expire on February 18, 2006.  The  statutory authority for permitting other than full and open competition  for this contract is Section 303[c][1] of the Federal Property and  Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended by the Competition in  Contracting Act, 41 USC 253[c][1], and implemented by FAR  6.302-1[a][2][ii][B], which authorizes other than full and open  competition when there is only one responsible source and no other  supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; and when it is  likely that an award to any other source may result in unacceptable delays  in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements.  No other firm has the requisite  number of key and non-key personnel possessing the required security  clearances, technical skill, and training to provide uninterrupted support  by February 18, 2006.  As such, this unique working environment  necessitates the award of a bridge contract to the incumbent contractor,  SAIC.

<DESC>The 99th Contracting Squadron seeks award of a Simplified Acquisition of Base Engineering Requirements (SABER) contracts.  A SABER contract is generally a fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contract and may include a wide variety of individual construction tasks as identified in a Prepriced Database that encompass most types of real property maintenance, repair, and construction work.  During the contract period, the Government team will identify various construction objectives required to complete each specific project.  The contractor will be required to manage and successfully accomplish each awarded project and may be required to maintain a management office on Nellis AFB NV.  Construction will be performed in Nevada for areas serviced by the Nellis Air Force Base (AFB) Contracting Office and may include Nellis AFB, Creech AFB, and Tonopah Test Range, all in Nevada.  Individual tasks will vary in size and complexity and may require availability of a strong multi-discipline team.  The guaranteed contract minimum is $100,000 (basic year only) and the maximum potential contract value is $30,000,000 over the term of the contract.  We anticipate that this contract will run concurrent with the current SABER contract for the Base Year and One-Option Period, which will impact the amount of design/cost and task orders issued during this period.  The annual capacity for the current SABER contract is $9 million each for the third and fourth option periods.  We anticipate that we will exceed this annual capacity and therefore require an additional contractor to fulfill the additional requirements.  During the remaining three option periods the new contractor will then have priority on all design/cost and task orders.  
A base year plus four one-year option periods is the contemplated contract term.  The average value of SABER construction task orders issued under the current SABER contract is $220,254, ranging from $2,000 to $750,000.  Offers are solicited only from small business concerns located in SBA Region VIII, IX and X who are expressly certified by a SBA district or regional office for participation in the 8(a) program; and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 236220 must specifically be included in the Offeror’s approved business plan.  Award will be based on best value using performance-price, trade-off (PPT) procedures.  The government anticipates significant subcontracting activity under the SABER contract.  No paper copies of the solicitation, specifications, or plans or will be issued from this office.  Telephone or fax requests will not be accepted.  The solicitation will be issued on the Federal Business Opportunities website at http://fedbizopps.gov.  The solicitation is anticipated to be issued on or about 15 February 2006.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT FOR A SPECIFIC PROJECT; THIS WILL BE AN INDEFINITE-QUANTITY (OPEN-ENDED) CONTRACT AND THE VARIOUS FIRMS AWARDED CONTRACTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPETE FOR PROJECTS THAT ARISE DURING THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT.  The contractor must be capable of performing at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees (but see note below).  The contractor must also be capable of performing several projects concurrently; projects may range from $2,000.00 to approximately $2,470,000.00 (GSA Prospectus Level).  The contractor will be required to furnish a bid bond and performance and payment bonds on projects over $25,000.00.  The intended term of the contract is one-year with four 1-year options.

The Government may, in addition, have a partial set aside for one or more of the following small business categories: Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses ("SDVOSB"), HUBZone Small Businesses ("HUBZone"), and 8(a) Concerns.  A partial set-aside will be made if there is a reasonable expectation of obtaining responsive offers from two or more responsible/capable concerns within the respective category, at fair market prices.  SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS WHICH ARE NOT SDVOSB, HUBZONE, OR 8(A) WILL STILL BE ELIGIBLE TO BID ON THE SOLICITATION.  To determine the feasibility of one or more of these set asides, ALL INTERESTED SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS (including those that are not SDVOSB, HUBZone, or 8(a)) are requested to submit qualifications showing evidence of their capability to perform successfully as a GENERAL CONTRACTOR on various concurrent repair and alteration projects.  PLEASE SUBMIT A LIST OF RELEVANT PROJECTS (WITHIN THE PAST 5 YEARS).  INCLUDE DATES, PROJECT DESCRIPTION, PROJECT LOCATION, DOLLAR AMOUNT, AND POINT OF CONTACT.

Note: In the case of a partial SDVOSB set-aside, the SDVOSB concern may include the employees of other SDVOSB concerns in meeting the 15 percent labor requirement. In the case of a partial HUBZone small business set-aside, the HUBZone small business concern may include the employees of other HUBZone small business concerns in meeting the 15 percent labor requirement.

<DESC>This modification revises pre-solicitation number N00019-05-R-0115 dated 22 September 2005.  The following amendment is as follows:

The Naval Air Systems Command, Air Combat Electronics Program Office (PMA-209), intends to award a sole source services and hardware contract to Aviation Communication and Surveillance Systems (ACSS), LLC, 19810 North 7th Ave, Phoenix, AZ 85027-4400 for the repair and modification of Traffic Alert and Avoidance Collision System (TCAS),Vertical Speed Indicator/Traffic Alert Advisory (VSI/TRA) displays that are current Government assets.  Repaired VSI/TRA display items will then incorporate a modification intiated under Service Bulletin 457400-34-084.   The scope of the effort will be to repair, test, modify, and deliver the VSI/TRA displays for use on airborne weapon systems platforms to fulfill Navy fleet requirements.  Estimated quantities for each of these items range up to 176 TCAS VSI/TRA display systems over a 36 month period. Quantities may increase as additional requirements are identified, at which time, notification will be made via the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site. The delivery schedule will start one month after receipt of order and receipt of units to modify with deliveries completed within 36 months after receipt of order.

This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. ACSS is owned by a joint venture between Thales Company (“Thales”) and L-3 Communications.  Thales has authorized ACSS (a division of L-3 Communications) as their sole military marketing agent for the TCAS VSI/TRA display units.  Thales does not market the  TCAS VSI/TRA displays through any other commercial vendor.  Thales does not and will not provide repair parts to any  vendor other than  ACSS, its sole and exclusive U.S. military market vendor.  The fabrication of certain repair parts involves proprietary Thales processes releaseable only to ACSS, and  the Government is therefore unable to obtain necessary repair and modification services except through ACSS. Consequently as ACSS is the sole - military vendor for these repair parts, it is the only qualified source available to perform this effort. 

It is anticipated that a Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract will be awarded for a period of 12 months with two (2) one year options.  While this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, interested parties may contact the undersigned to identify their interest.  Any interested parties must have the existing capabilities to meet all of the the Navy’s requirements and should submit all supporting  information for consideration to the Naval Air Systems Command on or before February 16, 2006.  Inquiries regarding this procurement should be directed to Mr.  Randy Johnston, Contract Specialist, Code 2.4.2.4.4 at (301) 757-5900, Facsimile (301) 757-5955 or via e-mail: randall.johnston@navy.mil, or to Ms. Maureen Bernard, Contracting Officer, 2.4.2.4, Phone (301) 757-5899, Facsimile: (301) 757-5955, or via e-mail: maureen.bernard@navy.mil.

<DESC>The subject RFP requires the prime contractor to provide data describing contemporary labor progression in the United States population and to compile and deliver a large database with data on 200,000 deliveries that is suitable for data analysis.  The data will need to be acquired by the resultant prime contractor from organizations that are considered “other than small businesses,” such as health care providers and hospitals, via the issuance of subcontracts.

As stated in the RFP, the Government estimates a total of 75% FTE per subcontract based on a subcontract that will be supplying 10,000 records.  Therefore, the Government’s subcontract effort estimate, as stated in the RFP for the estimated 20 subcontracts needed to supply the 200,000 records, equates to 31,200 hours (75% FTE per subcontractor * 20 subcontracts) based on a 2080 hour work year.  This total significantly exceeds the Governments’s total effort estimate for the prime contract of 12,376 hours (see Article L.1.e of the RFP).  As a result, the Government’s  total estimated cost of the Direct Labor for the subcontracts is also significantly more than the total estimated cost of Direct Labor for the prime contract.

Consequently, it has been concluded that there is virtually no chance that a small business offeror could provide a proposal with realistic and reasonable estimated Direct Labor costs for the prime contract and subcontracts that would not be in violation of the legal limitations on subcontracting for a Total Small Business Set Aside.  Specifically, FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, states that, for services (except construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern (i.e, prime contractor).  Therefore, the subject RFP is hereby changed from a Total Small Business Set Aside to full and open competition.

<DESC>The General Services Administration’s Federal Technology Service, Region 5 Chicago, on behalf of the U.S. Air Force Electronic Systems Center (ESC) Forces Protection Squadron, is issuing this Request For Information (RFI) in order to identify companies having the technology, qualification and capabilities to provide Hand Held and Desktop Explosion Detection Equipment for over 200 Air Force installations both Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside the Continental States (OCONUS).  Capabilities/qualifications submitted in response to this RFI will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  Responses will be evaluated for their viability.  The determination of procurement strategy, based upon the responses to this RFI, is solely within the discretion of the government.  All sources may submit a response, which will be considered by the government.  This RFI is for information and planning purposes only.  It does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.  Furthermore, the Government reserves the right to publish any information provided by a respondent to the RFI if publishing such information is done without attribution (i.e., does not identify the party submitting the response materials), and would not reveal company trade secrets or other similar protected or proprietary information.  For example, if a respondent were to ask when the draft RFP would be released, then such a question could be published without attribution and would not jeopardize any corporate or trade secrets of the respondent.  Accordingly, the Government may publish such materials.  On the other hand, if a respondent were to provide detailed product rollout plans for a new device, then that material would not be published if properly marked.

We invite comments/information on the following:
•	A respondent’s commercial-off-the-shelf product(s) and capability(-ies) to meet the requirements as drafted in the attached technical requirements document.  
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on an established Government contract (i.e., GSA FSS Schedule).
•	Whether the above products and capabilities are currently available on the open market.
•	Typical pricing structure for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Specifically, what is included in the unit price of the explosive detection device/equipment and what is priced separately?  For example, does the unit price of an explosive detection device/equipment include installation, manuals, training, technical support, upgrades, extended warranties, etc.
•	Client references to other Government Agency POC's with in-depth experience procuring similar devices.
•	Industry Performance Parameters and Measures of Performance/Standards for Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  Please provide the Government with information and advice regarding recognized Government and/or Industry standards to describe the detailed technical capabilities of handheld and desktop explosives detection equipment.   The Government is especially interested in standards that might be used to describe the capabilities of such equipment generically, using the standard itself as a qualifying parameter for equipment procured, without going into the potentially classified details of the equipment's capabilities.  The Government's intent is to be able to specify the technical requirements of such devices by requiring compliance with a standard (that may itself contain detailed classified information) in a procurement that contains no specifically classified details in either the requirement statement or the resultant proposals. 
•	Security Classifications for Explosive Detection Equipment standards or performance capabilities.
•	Common commercial practices and standards for warranty coverage applicable to Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.  For example, what is and is not covered under the warranty(-ies)?  What is the duration of the warranty period?  Are extended warranties common and available for this equipment?
•	Common commercial practices and standards for preventative maintenance (i.e., How much preventative maintenance for explosive detection equipment is required?  Is this typically carried out end users or under maintenance agreements with the manufacturer or other service provider?).
•	Common commercial practices and standards regarding end user training on the use and maintenance of Handheld and Desktop Explosive Detection Equipment.
•	Management and operations associated with delivery of equipment, quality control, scheduling, training and technical support to include domestic and overseas locations. 
•	Contractor’s and/or potential subcontractors’ status as a small business, veteran owned small business, -HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, women-owned small business.
•	Proprietary Information.  Indicate specifically whether the response includes proprietary information, and which information should be considered proprietary.  Requirements for marking proprietary information are in FAR Subsection 3.104.  Note:  See FAR Subsection 3.104-4 for how this information will be safeguarded, if properly labeled.
This RFI is being issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.201(e).  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI.  Responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and the Government’s use of such information.

<SOLNBR>4586
<RESPDATE>033106
<CONTACT>Dy Le, 609-485-4636
<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) TCBAA-06-0001 Rotorcraft Damage Tolerance (RCDT) For Metallic Materials 1. Background The FAA is currently considering the damage tolerance requirement for rotorcraft structures and dynamic components.  While the damage tolerance methodology has been extensively and successfully used in fix-wing aircraft structures, rotorcraft has just begun to use it in addition to the safe-life approach.  Generally, safe-life, in flight hours, is experimentally determined using the mission profile, flight loads, and S-N data.  Using Miner's cumulative fatigue damage rule, a fatigue damage rate for each flight condition is typically calculated by assessing the damaging load cycles per hour from the flight spectrum and loads data, the ratio of the alternating load to the endurance limit, and the cycles-to-failure from a standard component S-N curve.  A reciprocal summation of each fatigue damage rate for each flight condition then determines the retirement life of the part being analyzed. In contrast to safe-life, the damage tolerance (DT) approach assumes that an inherent flaw or crack exists in the manufactured part.  The life of the part is determined using fracture mechanics methodologies, load spectrum, manufacturing process and operating environment.  Based on the computed crack growth life of the inherent flaw or crack, suitable inspection intervals are established so that cracks can be found and repaired long before they achieve a critical length.  The effectiveness of the damage tolerance approach depends on several factors that include fatigue crack growth data, initial crack sizes, fracture mechanics and computational methods, effects of shot-peening and cold working, and inspection techniques. The success of implementing the damage tolerance approach to fixed-wing aircraft structures, coupled with the FAA's goal to enhance aircraft safety has lead to RCDT research and development (R&D) efforts for rotorcraft.  In 2005, the FAA assessed the current state of RCDT and fracture mechanics technologies.  During the assessment, the FAA asked the rotorcraft community for their inputs on fracture mechanics and RCDT-related technologies.  The FAA then conducted the gap analysis to identify research needs for supporting FAA rulemaking.  Identified RCDT research tasks were then prioritized using the FAA prioritization process and criteria.  Finally, a roadmap for RCDT was developed to guide the research to support FAA rulemaking and the implementation of RCDT requirement.    2. Purpose The objective of this BAA is to solicit proposals to conduct the RCDT research to support FAA rulemaking.  Particularly, this effort shall support FAR 29.571, 27.571, AC 29-2A, AC 27-1A, AC-29-2C, FAA Order 8110.9 which can be downloaded using the following link:  http://www.airweb.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAdvisoryCircular.nsf/MainFrame?OpenFrameSet 3. Submission Deadlines Technical summary proposals shall be prepared according to guidelines described in sections 4 (Submission Requirements) and 5 (Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements).  Technical summary proposals will be accepted until fiscal year 2006 (FY-06) funding for the RCDT effort is fully committed.  Offerors are therefore encouraged to submit the technical summary proposal as soon as they can before FY-06 funding is fully committed or exhausted.  Upon request from the FAA, formal technical proposals addressing the research requirements described in section 6 shall be submitted not more than thirty (30) working days after the date of the request sent by email.  FAA's request will be made via email only.  4. Submission Requirements Offerors will submit two-page technical summaries prior to submitting a formal proposal.  The two-page technical summary shall meet the requirements described below.  Mail the two-page technical summaries to: FAA William J. Hughes Technical Center Code AAR-480, Building 300 (Attn: D. Le) Atlantic City Int'l Airport, NJ 08405 In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the summary proposal will be emailed to dy.le@faa.gov.  The electronic version shall be provided in Microsoft Word.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having a security protection. Thirty (30) working days or earlier, after receipt of the two-page technical summaries, the FAA will respond to offerors in one of three ways: a.	Request for the submission of a formal technical proposal. b.	Recommendation to submit a formal technical proposal if certain changes are made or conditions met. c.	Rejection of the summary proposal. If requested, the offeror shall submit a formal technical proposal, containing a detailed discussion of the items presented in the selected two-page technical summary.  Additionally, the formal technical proposal shall address all or some of the research requirements described in section 6 of this announcement, Formal Proposal Requirements.  The formal technical proposal will be mailed to the FAA at the same address as the summary proposal.  In addition (not as a substitute for the paper copy), an electronic version of the formal technical proposal in Microsoft Word shall be emailed to dy.le@faa.gov.  Submitted electronic proposals shall not have any security protection requiring the FAA to obtain a password or an authorization from the offeror prior to opening the proposal or file.  The FAA will not review submitted proposals having a security protection. The FAA shall receive both versions of the formal technical proposals according to the submission deadlines required in section 3. Formal proposals shall not exceed 50 pages. 5. Two-Page Technical Summary Requirements There is no specific format for the two-page technical summary.  The summary may be preceded by a cover letter, but the cover letter will not be considered in the evaluation, nor will pages in excess of two.  At a minimum the summary shall contain the following items: a.	Affiliation, contact or principal investigator name, phone, and mailing and email addresses. b.	The specific purpose/objective of the proposed research applicable to FAA rulemaking on RCDT. c.	Description of the research approach. d.	Description of research outputs and how they will be incorporated in RCDT regulations.  e.	Description of the metrics used to measure research performance. f.	Description of the current technology level (TRL) of the subject technology being proposed for validation and demonstration and the achieved TRL at the conclusion of the proposed research.  Standard TRL, GAO/NSIAD-99-162 Best Practices Appendix I - Technology Readiness Level Descriptions, developed by the General Accounting Office should be used and can be downloaded using the following link: http://www.tswg.gov/tswg/techtrans/TRLDefinitions.pdf g.	Description of research exit criteria (e.g., criteria used to determine if the defined objectives of research have been met).  h.	Estimated time (e.g., years) for the proposed research. i.	Estimated funds required for the proposed effort, including in-house and sub-contracted funds.   j.	Description of research collaborations, if applicable.  Collaborations with other research entity (e.g., Government agencies, rotorcraft industry, and academia) are not required but will also be considered positively during technical summary and proposal evaluation. 6. Formal Proposal Requirements  When requested by the FAA, formal technical proposals shall address all or some of the following approaches: a.	Advancement of rotorcraft component stress distribution calculation and analysis. b.	Development of initial flaw/crack size state (equivalent initial flaw/crack size) and methodology.  c.	Enhancement, validation, and technology transfer of fracture mechanics and computational methodologies for rotorcraft design and certification. d.

THE CONTRACT WILL NOT BE FOR A SPECIFIC PROJECT; THIS WILL BE AN INDEFINITE-QUANTITY (OPEN-ENDED) CONTRACT AND THE VARIOUS FIRMS AWARDED CONTRACTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO COMPETE FOR PROJECTS THAT ARISE DURING THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT.     The contractor must be capable of performing at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees (but see note below).     The contractor must also be capable of performing several projects concurrently; projects may range from $2,000.00 to approximately $2,470,000.00 (GSA Prospectus Level).     The contractor will be required to furnish a bid bond and performance and payment bonds on projects over $25,000.00.     The intended term of the contract is one-year with four 1-year options.     The Government intends to award multiple contracts for this solicitation.     YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO SERVE AS GENERAL CONTRACTOR ON EACH PROJECT YOU ARE AWARDED.     AS GENERAL CONTRACTOR, YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO PERFORM CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE WORK (INCLUDING PROVIDING A PROJECT SUPERINTENDENT) WITH YOUR OWN EMPLOYEES AND TO SUBCONTRACT FOR THE REMAINING PORTIONS (SPECIALIZED TRADES) OF THE PROJECT.     AS GENERAL CONTRACTOR, YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE PROJECT (THE WORK OF ALL TRADES).     The Government intends to set aside this procurement to small business concerns only (concerns whose average annual revenue for the previous 3 fiscal years does not exceed $31 million - under NAICS 236220).     The Government may, in addition, have a partial set aside for one or more of the following small business categories: Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses ("SDVOSB"), HUBZone Small Businesses ("HUBZone"), and 8(a) Concerns.     A partial set-aside will be made if there is a reasonable expectation of obtaining responsive offers from two or more responsible/capable concerns within the respective category, at fair market prices.     SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS WHICH ARE NOT SDVOSB, HUBZONE, OR 8(A) WILL STILL BE ELIGIBLE TO BID ON THE SOLICITATION.     To determine the feasibility of one or more of these set asides, we are seeking to identify potential sources.  ALL INTERESTED SMALL BUSINESS FIRMS (including those that are not SDVOSB, HUBZone, or 8(a)) are requested to submit qualifications showing evidence of their capability to perform successfully as a GENERAL CONTRACTOR on various concurrent repair and alteration projects.     PLEASE SUBMIT A LIST OF RELEVANT PROJECTS (WITHIN THE PAST 5 YEARS).     INCLUDE DATES, PROJECT DESCRIPTION, PROJECT LOCATION, DOLLAR AMOUNT, AND POINT OF CONTACT.

See FAR 19.1403 for eligibility requirements as SDVOSB; see FAR 19.1303 for eligibility as certified HUBZone; and see FAR 19.802 for eligibility as certified 8(a).     Note: In the case of a partial SDVOSB set-aside, the SDVOSB concern may include the employees of other SDVOSB concerns in meeting the 15 percent labor requirement. In the case of a partial HUBZone small business set-aside, the HUBZone small business concern may include the employees of other HUBZone small business concerns in meeting the 15 percent labor requirement.     Submit qualifications AND A STATEMENT OF WHETHER YOUR FIRM IS SDVOSB, HUBZone, AND/OR 8(a), NOT LATER THAN FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2006, to: Scott D.

<DESC>Sources Sought for Services Related to Compliance and Oversight Activities for the Medicare Drug Benefit Program 

THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis in support of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Center for Beneficiary Choices.  CMS is seeking capability statements from business firms who have proven expertise in health care and pharmacy benefits management with an emphasis on program management, compliance and auditing.

Background

Title I of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Action of 2003 (MMA) established a new prescription drug benefit under Part D of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (Act).  This new voluntary benefit, referred to as Medicare Part D begins on January 1, 2006.  CMS has contracted with licensed risk-bearing entities to administer the prescription drug benefit (Part D) in designated regions to beneficiaries in the Medicare fee-for-service market.  We refer to these Part D plans as stand alone, risk-bearing PDPs. Many Medicare managed care plans will also be adding a Part D benefit to their existing program. Finally, these Medicare Advantage-Part D (MA-PD) benefits will also be provided under a risk arrangement.

The MMA also contains a retiree drug subsidy (RDS) program to provide support for qualified employer/union health plans in reducing their drug costs while allowing Medicare eligible retirees to retain their current plan designs. All Part D plans must offer a standard drug benefit, but may also vary the benefit offering within defined parameters. 

Title II of the MMA modified and renamed Medicare+Choice (M+C), Part C to the Medicare Advantage (MA) program.  Changes to the MA program beginning with the 2006 contract year include the authority to establish new MA regional plans organized as preferred provider organizations (PPOs). Subpart J of the final MA regulation provides special rules for the new regional PPOs.

The MMA also introduced a new process for determining beneficiary premiums and benefits for 2006 and future years under which MA organizations will submit a “bid” reflecting their revenue needs for covering the benefits they plan to offer.  Subparts F and G of the final MA regulation have been rewritten because of the new bidding process.  

Additional information about the MMA can be found at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/MMAUpdate/.  The final rule implementing Part D and regulating the MA program are available from the Federal Register online database at http://www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html.  

CMS is seeking qualified contractors to perform various duties in the following functional areas for Parts C and D: 1) performing compliance and oversight audits; 2) provision of specialized expertise in any or all of the areas detailed  below and the ability to provide technical assistance to health plans in these areas; 3) evaluating the business operations of health plans for stability and viability; and 4) testing health plans customer service resources and evaluating their beneficiary protection systems.  

The following web site address contains information on the Prescription Drug Plans and links to the guidance documents that have been released http://new.cms.hhs.gov/PrescriptionDrugCovGenIn/.  Information on the Medicare Modernization Act is available at http://new.cms.hhs.gov/MMAUpdate/.  Respondents shall provide a capability statement which offers information regarding practical knowledge in performing compliance and oversight audits, provision of technical assistance, and the ability to arrive on-site at a contractor’s location within one week of request.

ITA has approximately 3,000 employees, almost half of which are in its Washington, DC Headquarters offices and the remainder of who are in about 108 domestic U.S. Export Assistance Centers and 170 overseas embassies, consulates and trade centers worldwide.  ITA employees are categorized by user classes (categories of employees that share common information and/or work process requirements).  In general, individuals in a user class use computer applications in similar ways even though they may be using the applications to access different data.  An individual in ITA may belong to one or more user classes.

ITA Customers, Products and Services, Delivery Channels

Recent restructuring activities in ITA identified and defined three major types of ITA customers.  They are respectively:

Oversight Authorities or agencies that set goals, establish strategic direction, appropriate funds, establish statutes and/or monitor and/or govern ITA’s effectiveness.
Examples include: White House, Congress (includes GAO), Department of Commerce, Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel Management/Foreign Service.

Business Customers who are the users of ITA’s products and services: the entities around whom ITA organizes its processes and resources.  Examples include:

•	U.S. Businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises.
•	Representatives of U.S. Businesses including legal, trade associations, intermediaries, and other service providers.
•	Foreign Importers;
•	Foreign Participants to unfair trade proceedings.

Partners who are agencies or entities external to ITA that ITA works with or through to meet Oversight Authority or Business Customer needs.

Products and Services Offered to Customers
ITA has over eighty existing products and services that fall into three major product and service families:

•	Information and Education
•	Navigating the Export Process, and
•	Ensuring Fair Trade and Market Access

Delivery Channels to ITA Customers

The channels listed below represent the means of delivery of ITA products and services to its customers, whether business customers, oversight authorities, partners or internal employees, to fulfill specific needs and requests. Specific channels are identified below, along with examples of current use at ITA.

Web Sites – an automated form of delivery resulting from interaction of ITA customers or employees with ITA web sites such as Export.gov.  ITA websites offer the opportunity to:

•	Standardize information, e.g. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ’s)
•	Personalize information based on type of “customer”, e.g. Status of cases,
•	Facilitate high-volume, simple transactions, e.g. filling the One-Stop registration form on Export.gov
•	Support Form downloads, e.g. downloading PDF files for NAFTA Documentation of Origin
•	Disseminate internal and external news quickly and broadly to a target audience, e.g. broadcast messages to employees on OurPlace Intranet

E-mail - an automated form of message delivery, which supports:

•	Asynchronous but “threaded” communications over a period of time, e.g., correspondence relating to a trade event, trade mission, an anti-dumping or advocacy case.
•	Complex, individualized information and communication among employees, other Federal agencies and customers.

Telephone – an automated form of communication making use of voice menus and keypad selections or supporting interpersonal communication, which facilitates:

•	Transmittals of medium to complex information not covered by web site material, e.g., Trade Information Center assistance for exporting via new free trade zones
•	Voice communications and services where there is poor web access, or where customers demand personal attention

FAX – an automated form of service delivery involving the delivery of document images over a telephone line to a customer’s FAX device, which supports:

•	The need for hard copy information or where there is poor web access or no email, e.g. FAX campaigns to recruit prospects for export promotion

Personal or Collaborative – interactions between ITA’s customers and stakeholders with its trade specialists, commercial officers, trade policy experts, industry analysts and other key staff which facilitates:

•	High-value interactions, e.g. counseling, strategy, or policy formulation sessions
•	Foreign cases requiring intervention, detailed knowledge of foreign markets or industry sectors, e.g., USG advocacy of commercial opportunities overseas.

Publication – information published in hard copy form and delivered by physical mail or other means to the customer, which supports:

•	In depth information tailored to a particular, market, industry, customer segment or issue.
•	The dissemination of information that is too voluminous to be read effectively over the web. Publications may also available in downloadable versions to cut postage or other distribution costs.

Additional RFI Context Considerations

ITA is assessing the appropriate mix of automated versus interpersonal channels to satisfy customers at an affordable cost.  Like many enterprises in the private sector, ITA is finding that channels are not a “one-size fits all” problem.  ITA’s higher value services, e.g., counseling, are not suited to automation.  However, the web channel or the email channel can be used to filter requests for high-value services or to direct customers to the appropriate ITA resources.

Cost per service or transaction is an important consideration for service delivery channels.  A strategy to “gravitate” customers towards the channels that provide the best quality of service for a particular type of service at the least cost can provide customers with better service while enabling ITA “do more with less”.

For example, educating customers to receive documents downloaded over the web, or to be able to check on the status of a request over the web could enable the customer to get the information on demand and less expensively, as opposed to dealing with an ITA trade specialist for mundane tasks.  This frees up valuable human assets to provide better service in higher value transactions.

RFI Response Requirements:  

ITA must accomplish its complex mission in an environment of increasing geopolitical, and global economic demands and a constantly changing technology.  Therefore, the ITA enterprise planning and execution process must be broad, deep, and agile, and it requires the support of a highly developed and capable global email support system.

Some of the existing Lotus Notes email and collaborative systems in use by ITA have been very effective at supporting their designated part of the overall process; however, they have evolved over the years as less than integrated systems and are running on hardware that is using older and out-of-date operating systems.  Today, the email and collaborative systems in their current configurations are not able to provide the full range of capability that is essential for the effective and efficient communications and collaboration.

Consequently, ITA wishes to review options for outsourcing, upgrading or replacing the existing systems and capabilities and requests responses to the following three items or categories of information: 

1.	Provide information on costs for migrating 3000 users and 4600 accounts from Lotus Domino to Microsoft Exchange, considering the requirements and the organizational, employee, and customer context presented above.

2.	Provide per seat costs to operate and maintain the system at a service level of 99.5%.

3.	Provide optional email and collaborative services and costs that you offer that are not included in your basic services for managed but complete messaging services.

Request this information be provided by 21 February 2006.

Important Notice – In lieu of taking email or phone or fax questions on this RFI, please make assumptions based on the information provided herein and document them in your response.  Electronic submissions by email are required.  Thank you for your understanding in this matter.

<ARCHDATE>02022007
<CONTACT>Krista Y Jensen, Contracting Officer, Phone (321) 867-3077, Fax (321) 867-1029, Email Krista.Jensen-1@KSC.NASA.GOV - Laura B. Rochester, Contracting Officer, Phone (321) 476-4027, Fax (321) 476-4004, Email Laura.Rochester-1@ksc.nasa.gov
<DESC>NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP). Background: The Technology Transfer Office is responsible for implementation of the Innovative Partnerships Program (IPP) at KSC.  One of the primary missions of the IPP is to “provide leveraged technology alternatives for Mission Directorates, Programs, and Projects through joint partnerships with industry, academia, non-profit organizations, government agencies and national laboratories.”   The NASA KSC Technology Transfer Office released a Call for Proposals on January 25th, 2006, soliciting proposals from NASA KSC Scientists for dual-use projects relevant to NASA’s mission-related challenges, consisting of a minimum of 25% cost-sharing (in-kind and cash contributions) from both NASA KSC and the Non-NASA Partner.  The ultimate goal of the Call for Proposals is to develop products that meet the needs of both NASA KSC and the Partner.	Some expected benefits for both NASA KSC and the Partner include an:	(1) increased range of technology solutions (e.g., a broadened portfolio); (2) reduction in costs; (3) accelerated maturation of technologies; and a (4) larger pool of qualified commercial providers.  NASA KSC is seeking Partners to participate with NASA KSC Scientists to develop and execute proposals in the specific areas defined below.	Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that selected proposal(s) would result in cost-sharing contracts, cooperative agreements, and/or space act agreements. This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience consistent with the requirements for each KSC technology area outlined below. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA.   Partner selection(s) will be made by KSC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability, and availability of key personnel. This criterion evaluates the proposers’ relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control.	This criterion evaluates the proposer’s ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area.   (3) Cost sharing – This criterion evaluates the proposer’s cost-sharing level and quality. (4) Facilities. This criterion evaluates the proposer’s facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to two (2) pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. All responses shall be submitted to: John F. Kennedy Space Center, Attn: Rosemary Baize, Mail Code KT-F, Kennedy Space Center, FL 32899; or via email to: Rosemary.R.Baize@nasa.gov.   The due date for submission is February 16, 2006. Procurement questions shall be directed to Krista Jensen, NASA KSC Procurement Office, Krista.Y.Jensen@nasa.gov. Technical questions shall be directed to Rosemary Baize at the email address noted above.    The specific technology areas follow: 1) Global Environmental Micro Sensors NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the development and field testing of a miniaturized atmospheric sensor system.  Specifically, the Global Environmental Micro Sensors (GEMS) Test Operations in the Natural Environment (GEMSTONE) project has a requirement for a prototype miniaturized sensor system capable of making in-situ measurements of the following atmospheric variables as a function of position and time: (1) temperature, (2) relative humidity, (3) pressure and (4) vector wind velocity.  The individual sensors must be sufficiently small and lightweight to remain aloft for several days in the upper troposphere or lower stratosphere upon deployment from a balloon or aircraft.  This may be accomplished by buoyancy or aerodynamic means or both.  The individual sensors must be self-contained including all required power and communications to transmit the sensor data to the ground either directly or via satellite link.  Production units must be sufficiently inexpensive to deploy in large quantities (thousands per mission) as disposables. In addition, the production units must meet FAA requirements for use in controlled airspace in the same manner as current commercially available radiosondes. Accuracy of measurements must be comparable to these radiosondes.  Sensor measurements must be taken in one-minute (or less) intervals with data available on the ground within five minutes in the operational version of the system.   Qualifying partners must have experience in meteorological instrumentation, data acquisition, and data assimilation including automated quality control. 2) Statistical Forecasting of Lightning Cessation NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to develop statistical techniques to forecast the last lighting strike.  KSC is seeking techniques to more accurately assess when the last lightning strike has occurred in a thunderstorm to improve the capability of forecasters to terminate lightning warnings earlier. Accurate lightning warnings are a crucial operational requirement, critical to both personnel safety and resource protection. However, the tools available to forecasters to provide accurate lightning cessation predictions within a 20 mile radius of the launch pad are deficient. Consequently, forecasters are conservative in terminating lightning warnings, thus shutting down operations at KSC far longer than necessary and adversely impacting both ground operations costs and schedule.   The partner will be required to develop statistical techniques based upon data from an extensive local weather infrastructure; archived data from the 45th Space Wing lightning detection systems; KSC’s extensive field mill network, which measures the electric field near the surface and; KSC’s unique Lightning Detection and Ranging (LDAR) system.  The LDAR system provides observations of cloud-to-ground discharges, intra and inter-cloud discharges, and is used to identify, with spatial resolution typically better than 200 meters, the development and evolution of thunderstorm electrical discharge patterns in relation to thunderstorm structure. Additional information on LDAR data is available at :  http://microwave.nsstc.nasa.gov:5721/dataset_documents/ldar_dataset.html  .  Based on earlier, exploratory studies, this combination of data should help yield a greatly improved lightning cessation forecast tool. Upon development of the statistical techniques, the partner will be required to test and verify the technique against real-world data sets. Qualifying partners must have a demonstrated track record in lightning analysis and forecasting, including a methodology for specifying how accurate the proposed technique is relative to actual test data. In addition, partners must be able to integrate data from multiple sources and have familiarity with the latest weather prediction tools including numerical weather prediction models, satellite and radar data.  Knowledge of KSC’s LDAR system is considered a plus. 3) Development of Paint Product for Aerospace Applications NASA KSC is currently seeking partner(s) to collaborate in the development of a paint product based on a novel smart coating system for aerospace applications.  This smart coating is based on the controlled release of microcapsules for early corrosion detection and inhibition without human intervention.  The coating has the capacity of incorporating and releasing on demand newly developed corrosion inhibitors.  The overall objective of this collaborative project is not to provide just one coating system with a given function, but to provide a systematic methodology which can then be effectively be used for testing newly developed inhibitors in paint systems.  The selected partner will be required to work with NASA personnel to address the optimal substrate to coat; the coat system (single or multi-coat); the desired properties of the coating (e.g., hardness, UV resistance, etc.); the projected lifetime of the coating; and the expected cost-per-gallon for raw materials.   NASA personnel will provide the typical substrates and exposure conditions experience at the KSC launch site.   Qualifying partners must have demonstrated experience in developing industrial and marine coatings. In addition, potential partners must be knowledgeable in applicable ASTM and federal environmental compliance standards.  Familiarity with corrosion coatings is considered a plus.

<DESC>PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY FOR THE PETROLEUM QUALITY ANALYSIS SYSTEM (PQAS) Purpose: The purpose of this survey is to solicit interest in the implementation of Performance Based Logistics (PBL) for the Petroleum Quality Analysis System (PQAS). The Army is looking for potential contractors to perform in the role of Product Support Integrato r/Product Support Provider for the PQAS. In Accordance With (IAW) AR 70-1 and DOD 5000.1, PBL is the preferred support strategy for materiel systems.  The Army will implement PBL on weapon systems in order to provide the war fighter increased operational r eadiness; increased reliability; enhanced logistics response times; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support; reduction in the  logistics footprint, and reduction in logistics costs.  The selected PBL contractor will be responsible for some portion of the system logistics support, which could include, but is not limited to, supply chain management (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance, sustainment level maintenance  (scheduled and unscheduled), and sustainment training. The Army will retain responsibility for the scheduled and unscheduled field maintenance of PQAS units.  Operator and maintenance training, and New Equipment Training (NET)  will be TACOMs  responsibility.  The system support processes will be transparent to the war fighter.  In addition, the Product Manager will be responsible for vehicle configuration, including recommendation and implementation of configuration changes to improve performance, reliability and maintenance. PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequently used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of Contract: Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Price Contract for up to 5 years.   Goals. Desired Results and Outcomes:  Expected performance results from the PBL provider for the PQAS is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an increase in operational availability by; reducing the logistics footprint; reducing maintenance/repai r times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance; providing relief to the army from conducting sustainment training,  and ultimately reducing O&S costs to the Army.   Measurements: Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation. Reduced Logistics Footprint: * Measurable reduction in the time it takes to deliver field and sustainment level spare and repair parts to the requiring organization Reduced maintenance/repair times: * Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to return repaired sustainment level equipment/parts to the supply system. Relief from conducting sustainment training: * Measurable reduction in the number of sustainment training classes conducted by the Army. PBL System Candidates: Systems that will be supported using PBL are those systems currently in production, systems currently in the Army fleet, and those undergoing reset/recap.  Operational profiles will include both wartime and peacetime Operations Tempo (Optempo) if available .  See Appendix B for a profile of the PQAS. PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE FOR THE PETROLEUM QUALITY ANALYSIS SYSTEM (PQAS) Name of Company: Address: City, State, Zip Code: Point of Contact (POC) information: Name: Telephone Number: Email Address: Website Address: What is the size of your business; i.e. large business, small business, 8(a)?  1.  Describe your companys experience, if any, in providing PBL support to army vehicles or systems. 2.  Have you successfully performed the in the role of Product Support Integrator/ Product Support Provider on any other army or DoD vehicles or system? If so, on which vehicles or systems and what was the extent of the support provided? 3. If you have performed under a PBL contract in the past, what are some of the best practices you have used to be successful? 4. What would be your plan for managing the supply chain (parts support) for field and sustainment level maintenance and integrating that with the current organic system? 5. What potential constraints and boundaries do you anticipated within the responsibilities of managing a PBL support contract? 6. How do you propose the government should measure the specific areas of performance related to reducing the logistics footprint, reducing maintenance/repair times, and providing relief from conducting sustainment training?  What recommendations can your organization provide? 7. What would be your plan for reducing maintenance/repair times for scheduled and unscheduled sustainment level maintenance? 8. How would your company manage a sustainment training program and reduce the Armys training burden?  9. Would your company be interested in providing PBL support under a long-term contract?    10. Compare and contrast the different strategies your company would utilize in wartime vs. peacetime situations. 11. Do you feel the desired results and outcomes as defined above are attainable? 12. Are there any other areas of logistics support in which your company would be interested in providing a service? Keep in mind that this is a continuous improvement and learning exercise for the government and industry. We do not have all the answers nor do we even know all the right questions.  Please take time to relate to us any ideas/suggestions you may have in im proving our questionnaire or any other areas where you may have insight. Send responses to this market research survey questionnaire to the PM POCs by email: Joe Scott e-mail address: scottjoe@tacom.army.mil and Jim Doherty e-mail address: dohertyj@tacom.army.mil. Your organization may provide response to all or part of this qu estionnaire. Replies to this questionnaire must be received by 2 Mar 05.   The response can be marked as confidential.  Clearly indicate that the information is Proprietary if appropriate.  All participation is voluntary and no compensation will be provided for respo nding to this survey. The Army appreciates your participation in this survey.   APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or P rogram Managers (PM's), their designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a    predetermined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).   Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.  The PSI will be required to ne gotiate Performance Based Agreements (PBA) type arrangements with all PSPs to fulfill their responsibility.   Examples of PSPs include:  DLA centers, AMC MSC Inventory Materiel Management Centers (IMMCs), Depots, contractors sub-contractors, etc. New Equipment Training: The identification of personnel, training, and training aids and devices and the transfer of knowledge gained during development from the materiel developer/provider to the trainer, user, and supporter. Sustainment Training: Individual and c ollective training conducted in the unit or resident schools, units, and organizations to ensure continued expertise on the operations, employment, and logistics support of fielded systems or equipment. Sustainment Maintenance: Sustainment maintenance is off-system maintenance and is mainly repair of defective equipment/parts. Sustainment maintenance returns repaired equipment/parts to the supply system. It covers selected Direct Support (DS) tasks, Gener al Support, and Depot maintenance. Field Maintenance: Field maintenance is on-system maintenance and is mainly replacement of defective parts and preventative maintenance. Field maintenance returns repaired equipment to the soldier. It covers crew, unit, and selected Direct Support (DS) mai ntenance tasks. Some off-system maintenance can be done at field level if, based on task analysis, it is simple to complete or it is critical to mission readiness. Operational Availability: A measure of the degree to which a system is either operating or is capable of operating at any time when used in a typical operational and support environment. APPENDIX B PROFILE FOR THE PQAS Vehicle System:  Petroleum Quality Analysis System (PQAS) Model Designators:  M1159 NSN 6640-01-501-2726 System Description: The PQAS is a fully integrated fuel laboratory installed in an  environmentally controlled expandable shelter, mounted on a High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV, M1113) with a High Mobility Trailer (HMT, M1102) for transporting support equipment, supplies and a tent.  The PQAS is a complete petroleum labor atory capable of conducting the tests required by the Combat Developer on kerosene based and diesel fuels. System software provides an information database/expert system for the technician to consult in interpreting test results and in making recommendatio ns for the disposition of fuels. Data  acquisition equipment includes a modem that allows the PQAS to quickly transmit test results for the Unit of Employment (UE) to the requiring customers. The attached tent structure serves as a customer service area where samples can be received, logged, an d stored prior to processing.  The PQAS will require two operators to sustain operations for 20-hour days. Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile (OMS/MP):  Operational Mode Summary/Mission Profile.   a.  Wartime.  The PQAS is required to perform up to 30 samples for the appropriate mission level (as described in MIL-STD-3004) per day on samples representing multiple military fuels.  The number of samples required per day will be reduced on movement day s as shown in the table.  The PQAS fuel tests involve completing the required tests in accordance with approved procedures, printing of the results, and transmitting them to the requesting unit.  The PQAS is required to operate for 30 days at an average ra te of 15 samples per day under this OMS/MP without resupply  of expendable supplies with the exception of those expendable supplies found commonly throughout the theater (e.g., water, fuel, etc.).  The PQAS will move between sites on approximately 5 of every 7 operating days, with four short move days (25-50 miles) and one long move day (150 miles).  Preventive maintenance checks and services are performed at the beginning of the mission day and at the end of the mission day.  Additionally, the PMCS are performed simultaneously with setup and teardown of the PQAS.  T he table depicts a 1-week mission for the PQAS.  Note that the PMCS addressed in this OMS/MP apply to PQAS devices and not to the transport vehicle or any shelter that is used.

Release of reference technical documentation is limited to United  States corporations and United States citizens.     2.0  Background  The Department of Defense established the JTRS program to provide a  family of software programmable radios based on the Software  Communications Architecture (SCA).  As such, the JTRS will provide  reliable secure multi-channel voice, data, imagery, and video  communications and eliminate communications problems caused by  'stovepipe' legacy systems.  The JTRS will achieve these objectives  through the procurement and fielding of a digital, programmable,  modular communication system based on software-defined radio  technology.  JTRS will provide interoperability through the capacity to communicate  with current tactical communications systems in the near term.  In the  future, JTRS will provide integrated information sharing through new  waveforms to support joint operations.  This interoperability will  help meet the demands of U.S. Military forces and Joint/Coalition  allies.  The JTRS Operational Requirements Document (ORD), version 3.2,  identifies four separate Threshold waveforms that constitute the HF  Waveform to be developed.    WF ID                 WF Name  W8                  HF-ISB ALE  W9                  HF-SSB ALE AJ  W11                 STANAG 5066 (HF Message Protocol)  W12                 STANAG 4529 (HF NB Modem)  Additionally, ORD 3.2 identifies several other waveforms that use  frequencies in the HF range that are being acquired under separate  efforts for a variety of reasons.  WF ID                 WF Name  W10                 Link-11/TADIL-A  W14                 HF ATC Data Link   W21                 Link-11B/TADIL-B  As part of this waveform initiative, the JTRS program is evaluating  the means by which they can establish a legacy HF capability within  the JTRS family of communications products.  This RFI solicits  industrys views on the state of HF radio technologies and uses,  insights into methodologies for developing a JTRS HF capability that  will be interoperable with DoD/non-DoD HF standard radios, and  comments on issues that could affect the affordability, reliability,  and maintainability of the JTRS HF waveform.   3.0  Requested Information  This RFI requests information from industry regarding the JTRS HF  waveform requirements as well as information regarding possible  acquisition strategies (i.e., phasing plans, characteristic groupings,  etc.).

1.  The AFSNCOA has submitted a Form 9 requesting contractual services supporting effective delivery of the Air Force CMSgt Leadership Course (CLC) during CY06 with XX XXXXX.  XX XXXXX has provided a key lecture entitled “The Art of Leadership” that supports the Senior Enlisted Leader Manager attribute of our CLC which constitutes 2 hours of approved course curriculum.  XX XXXX was specifically requested by the USAF Learning and Development Center because he provides an educational experience commensurate with that of General Officer, Senior Executive Service (SES) members, and GS-15s attending Senior Leader Orientation Course.  Over 700 CMSgts are scheduled to attend this course during FY06.  The dates for XX XXXXXs role in this course are as follows:
CLC-06A, 4 Mar; CLC-06B, 10 May; and CLC-06C, 5 Aug.

2.  XX XXXX delivers proprietary information recognized by AF senior leadership to be a critical component of our leadership development.  His presentation provides mirrored consistency with HQ USAF managed senior officer courses and ensures a developmental experience paramount to strategic leadership capability of our newly promoted CMSgts.  Additionally, the transformation and interweaving of proprietary information with doctrinal concepts has shown positive linkage with the stated AF enduring competencies and culture since its initial implementation in 2003.  The AFSNCOA has purchased XX XXXX’s book, 108 Skills of Natural Born Leaders as part of the approved CEPME curriculum for the CLC.  The author of the book is in the best position to provide his proprietary information.  XX XXXXX has worked exclusively with the AFSNCOA to tailor his program to the developmental needs of new CMSgts.  His program was rated at 98 percent during CY05.  He is a proven performer with an outstanding track record.  The goal of the CLC is to provide training consistency to CMSgts worldwide.  This course is only taught at one place… the AFSNCOA.  XX XXXXXs program is one-of-a-kind.  XX XXXXX is uniquely qualified to present this lesson and has done so for the Senior Leader Orientation Course (SLOC), a course for all new Brigadier Generals in the USAF Dr.  One of the goals of the CLC is to parallel segments of the senior officer training experienced at the SLOG.  Using the same presenters ensures continuity of professional development training between general officers and our chief master sergeants.

4.  No action is being taken at this time to preclude the necessity for future sole source of this training requirement.  USAF Force Development has directed us to maintain consistency in senior leader training.  

5.  Request expeditious  handling of this contract and that it be sole sourced to CCL due to the unique nature of the services provided.  Newly promoted CMSgts are being scheduled by Air Staff to attend this course.  Please direct any questions regarding this sole source request to XX XXXXX.

This services order will be procured in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Parts 12 and 13, through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-08.

In June of 2004, US Central Commands (USCENTCOM) Commander identified an operational need to defeat the IED threat encountered during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF).   Additionally, in November of 2005, USCENTCOM approved a Joint Urgent Operational Need to defeat RCIEDs.  To date, several Warlock materiel solutions have been employed that disrupt/prevent RCIED threats.  A next generation antenna is required for continu ed success against this pervasive, adaptive threat.  To initiate the antenna acquisition, Project Director Signals Warfare (PM SW) and Product Director, Counter Remotely Controlled Improvised Explosive Devices (RCIED) Electronic Warfare (CREW) will host an  Industry Day on 13 February 2006.  The Industry Day session will focus on the ANTICIPATED antenna acquisition strategy and technical details with respect to current WARLOCK Antenna requirements and future planning.   This acquisition will be a Best Value Source Selection with consideration given to Technical Performance, Price, Past Performance and Small Business Participation.  Technical Performance is a primary consideration.  The Government intends to award a Firm F ixed Price (FFP) five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract with the possibility of multiple awards.  Proposals submitted will require range quantity pricing for all Antennas and A Kits.  Two (2) prototype antennas will also  be submitted with each proposal.  Delivery will be for up to 500 per month with the surge capacity to go up to 500 per week.  The Governments initial order will be limited to a sufficient number of quantities necessary to support successful completion of  First Article Testing (FAT).  Its estimated that these quantities will consist of 25 each Antennas and A Kits.

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).

<DESC>The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) intends to award a Sole Source, Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 13, Simplified Acquisition to: Rockwell Scientific Company, 5212 Verdugo Way, Camarillo, CA 93012. 

For a research and development project, SAO will procure a HAWAII-1RG HyViSI Bare Multiplexer and Focal Plane Array.  This is an engineering grade device which is an upgrade to an existing Rockwell produced PICNIC based HyViSI device with added features and functionality.  The device is a a Hybrid Silicon CMOS imager. The device consists of a high-resistivity silicon PIN diode array bump bonded to a CMOS Multiplexer (MUX). The diode array is ~100microns thick and it has no AR coating. The PIN diode is to be fully depleted. The MUX is made from low resistivity silicon, it is inherently not susceptible to radiation damage and it allows pixel addressing and reset. Each pixel has its own source follower per detector (SFD) amplifier. The overall device must be inherently radiation hard. Single read with one CDS should have noise figures of < 10-15 electrons.  The readout should be non-destructive to allow Fowler sampling to reduce noise even further.  It has a 1024x1024 array format with 18x18 micron pixel pitch.  Additional specifications are available upon request.

This is a follow on procurement for a similar device with some upgrades.  Through a prior research and development collaboration with SAO, Rockwell has demonstrated the capability of making this device.  SAO believes that there is no device currently manufactured that provides the features of this HAWAII-1RG HyViSI device.

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 541710. The small business size standard is 500. Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package that provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet SAO’s requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, SAO will consider all responses received by the publication due date of this notice. A determination by SAO whether or not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of SAO. Responses must be received on or before February 17, 2006.

<DESC>The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) intends to award a Sole Source, Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract, under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 13, Simplified Acquisition to P&T Physics & Technology, LLC, 129 Toiyabe Ct., Livermore, CA 94550 for a Refrigerated Super Conducting 3 Tesla magnet system.

This magnet system will be used in a 40kV Refrigerated Electron Beam Ion Trap-Source (REBIT-S) for the performance of experiments with highly charged low emittance ion beams and for spectroscopy studies at SAO.  The magnet system (the subject of this synopsis) includes a closed cycle refrigerated SC-magnet, SC-lead system, vacuum chamber, cold shields, vacuum parts and REBIT stand.  The REBIT system is a compact, mobile non-liquid gas based, cryogenic REBIT including all the required electronic operating modules. The REBIT is based on a novel cryo-pump cooling scheme which couples efficiently the cold heads of the cryo-pumps to a super-conducting 3 Tesla magnet at 4K, the incorporated trap components at 4K and the cold shields at 70K.  The REBIT is computer controlled with all the necessary electronic systems integrated. The base unit operates at variable electron beam energies between 2-40kV, where its modular design allows conveniently an upgrade to 250 kV. The base unit provides for the ionization and excitation of virtually any element in the periodic table up to ionization stages of about 80+ for in-situ x-ray spectroscopy studies. Provision for ion extraction to operate the REBIT as an ion beam source can be easily adapted.  P&T, Physics and Technology LLC is the only supplier known to SAO that markets such a system. This cryogenic REBIT operates reliably as demonstrated by the REBIT sold to the University of Stockholm in Sweden. SAO knows of no other system matching these specifications that is commercially available.

The North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) is 334516. The small business size standard is 500. Contractors interested in this requirement should submit a complete technical package that provides clear and convincing evidence that they can meet SAO’s requirement.

THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

*** The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  This requirement is 100% set aside for small businesses.  Only interested small businesses may submit a quote. ***

***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Vacuum Cryogenic Probe Station to be used in the Semiconductor Electronics Division at NIST in Gaithersburg, Maryland. ***

Vacuum Cryogenic Probe Station
The Semiconductor Electronics Division, EEEL has a requirement for a vacuum cryogenic probe station for charge injection and transport measurements on novel and organic semiconductor materials and devices (part of EEEL’s Competence effort).

1. Background Information:
Using a conventional probe-station for electrical/electrical-optical characterization of novel semiconductor devices at the sub-millimeter to nanometer scale is nearly impossible as a vacuum chamber is needed for this cryogenic operation with helium supply for the cooling.  In addition, the probes shall be maintained at the same temperature as the sample to minimize thermal voltage and to reduce the background electrical noise in the measurement system.  Low noise operation is crucial for this type of low-level current-voltage measurements (~10-13 Amps, ~10-6 Volts).  Thus, to perform successful electrical/electrical-optical measurements a vacuum cryogenic probe station is needed with multiple electrical probes (6 total including substrate biasing) and an optical probe (1 total), and which can provide for a wide sample temperature range (less than 5 K to 450 K).  Such a system would permit diverse measurement methods to be employed in characterizing novel semiconductor materials and devices.  Importantly, beyond the need for high vacuum to provide thermal insulation at low temperature the high vacuum environment reduces extrinsic variables that may affect the characterization of the intrinsic material/device properties. 

The minimum requirements for the system are specified as follows:

2. Minimum Specification Sheet:
2.1 Basic System Requirements
1.	A minimum of five micro-manipulated probes allowing electrical measurements on 1 inch x 1 inch square samples with arbitrarily located contacts.
2.	A minimum of one optical fiber probe (UV) allowing optical measurements on 1 inch x 1 inch square samples with arbitrarily located features. 
3.	All probes must be maintained at the same temperature as the sample to minimize the thermal voltage (for example, through thermal anchoring on the stage). 
4.	Each probe must be capable of minimum travel distances of 2 inch in-sample plane along probe axis, of 1 inch in-sample plane perpendicular to probe axis, and 0.5 inch normal to sample plane.
5.	The chamber must have at least 1 unutilized vacuum port (KF/QF/NW 25) located on the baseplate.
6.	The chamber must have a top view-port through which the sample can be observed.
7.	The view-port must have IR-absorbing window to minimize external radiative heating.
8.	System must come with complete optics system (including full color display) able to resolve features of 3 um in size and allowing viewing of any part of the 1inch square sample as well as digital image transfer capability.
9.	Sample stage shall open to air to permit mounting of specimens.
10.	Specimen chamber must be able to be evacuated to 5x10-5 Torr or better at room temperature in 1 hr.
11.	Pumping and venting ports shall be KF/QF/NW 40 or larger.
12.	System must include a turbo molecular pumping station (with diaphragm backing pump, i.e. oil free) with vacuum gauge, display/controller, vacuum valve(s) and required plumbing.  Pump inlet pumping speed for N2 must be greater than 200 l/s (non aperture limited) with an ISO 100 inlet flange. 
13.	The system shall come with its own table and with a fully functional vibration isolation system.
14.	The system shall come with a liquid Helium transfer line and control valve.
15.	The system shall come with a liquid Nitrogen dewar with fitting(s) for use with the liquid Helium transfer line.
16.	A temperature measurement diode must be furnished with the delivered system to calibrate the sample temperature.  

2.2 Operating Temperature Requirements
1.	The system shall operate down to 5 K or below with a measurement accuracy of ± 0.1 K. This lower limit of temperature operation has to be guaranteed and verified in on-site demonstration. 
2.	The system must be able to operate up to at least 450 K.
3.	 The system must be configured to permit independent temperature control (heating or cooling) of the sample from that of the shielding, i.e. split flow cryostat.
4.	The system must come with all the necessary controllers and power supplies for independent control and measurement of the sample and shielding temperatures.

2.3 Electrical Measurement Requirements
1.	The delivered system must be configured for electrical measurements from DC to 50 MHz (minimum) and be re-configurable for measurements up to at least 50 GHz without major modification (replacement of probe arms permitted).
2.	The company must manufacture probes compatible with this system over a range of sizes (with tip radius ranging from at most 5 µm up to at least 25 µm) made of W, BeCu or similar durable alloys (for compatibility with future needs).
3.	System must be configured to permit an external voltage to be applied directly to the sample stage or holder for back-gate type measurements without using one of the five probes for this purpose. 
4.	All electrical connectors for connecting the probes and substrate to external test and measurement equipment must be triax and configured for guarded low-level measurements. 
5.	The system must have current leakage of less than 100 fA at 10 V on all cabling and feedthroughs (probe and substrate)

2.4 Installation/Training
Company shall install system at NIST, demonstrate all capabilities, and train users on operating procedures.

***Delivery shall be FOB DESTINATION and be completed in accordance with the Contractor’s commercial schedule. *** 

***The contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899-0001. ***

4.	BEST VALUE EVALUATION METHODOLOGY:

Best value evaluations is, in and of itself, a subjective assessment by the Government of the proposed solution that provides the optimal results to the Government, price and other factors considered, Subjectivity is inherent in the process and is the cornerstone of the source selection decision. In an effort to provide insight to the offerors as to the decision making process of the Government, the following information is provided:

Evaluation will be made on two factors – Technical and Price. In the evaluation, technical is significantly more important than price. While price is not as important as Technical, it does have significance to the Government.

In rating the technical proposals, the three factors (Technical Understanding, Professional Qualifications, and Past Performance) are listed in descending order of importance. Technical Understanding is moderately more important than the other two factors combined while Professional Qualifications is slightly more important then Past Performance/Corporate Experience.

Your firm’s submission should reflect and demonstrate an understanding of the Statement of Work and provide sufficient detail to be properly considered. Resumes and qualifications of proposed personnel shall also be provided. Your submission should reflect the quality and experience of proposed personnel at competitive fixed prices. The technical proposal shall not exceed 25 pages in length and single sided. The technical proposal shall include labor mix and hours, but not labor rates. During the technical evaluation, the labor mix and hours, not labor rates, will be evaluated. Price submissions shall be under separate cover and competitive firm fixed priced. Other Direct Costs proposed shall be realistic to the extent that all costs/prices can be fully supported. Resumes, and past performance do not count towards the page limitation. Email is the preferred method of submission.

6. BACKGROUND
WHS/ITMD currently has two Hewlett-Packard servers.  One is a production server and the other is a development server.  These servers have reached their end of life cycle and need to be replaced.  

Production Database Server

The production environment consists of one HP 9000 N400 (N Class) server primarily running HP-UX 11.0 with Oracle 8.1.7 databases that support a variety of custom applications as well as COTS products such as RESUMIX, Business Objects, and TrackIt.

Hardware Platform:  The current server configuration for the N Class server is as follows: two 36 GB internal disks, eight 36 GB Surestore disks, DVD ROM, two Single Port Ultra 2 SCSI HBA’s, three 800 MHz processors, 4 GB of RAM, one 100Base-T LAN adapter, one DDS3 DAT tape drive, rack mounted HP PowerTrust II-MR 4 kW (4.5 kVA) UPS 240v, which are installed in two HP9000 Standard Rack System E41.  The current operating system installed on the server is HP-UX 11.0 with an unlimited user’s license and is not clustered.  

Software Platform:
The HP-UX development environment consists of Oracle 8.1.7 and 9.x.  Backups are performed by CommVault Galaxy version 5.9.0.

Current Usage:  200 GBs of local storage to support the databases with an anticipated increase next year of 400 GBs.  Furthermore, the government anticipates a growth rate of 15 percent per year after FY07.  There four Oracle database instances which serve 36 concurrent users.  On average there are 100 sessions active at any given time with a peak of 200.   

Development Database Server

The development environment mirrors the production environment as stated above.

Production Web Server

Hardware:  The production web server is a Sun Fire 280R that has two 900 MHz processors, 4 GBs RAM, and two 72 GB internal hard drives.  It is running SUN Solaris 8.0.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541710 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML), has been charged with performing basic research contributing to the development of diagnostic reagents, therapeutics and vaccines against human bacterial pathogens. Construction of an Affymetrix microarray custom chip containing oligonucleotide sequences representing 15(fifteen) genomes will assist towards achieving those goals. The RML has a need to construct a custom chip from the manufacturer that shall contain a diverse array of bacterial pathogens. This chip shall be unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of its kind shall exist. The contractor shall provide to RML services  to produce a custom bacterial pathogen gene chip. This is a 6 to 8(six-eight) week, one time work effort, where the final product shall be a custom gene chip containing oligo pairs at high density, specific to 15(fifteen) bacterial pathogen genomes.  These chips shall be compatible with the Affymetrix fluidics and hybridization station and scanner. The contractor shall keep all RML derived data secure and shall not release or maintain any of the data beyond this contract effort. If Internet connectivity is needed in order to perform the work, or transfer deliverables, contractor computers shall be secure and in compliance with RML IT security procedures and policies.
