<DESC><p>The Laboratory Response Network (LRN) was established by the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in accordance with Presidential Decision Directive 39, which outlined national anti-terrorism policies and assigned specific missions to federal departments and agencies.&nbsp; The LRN's mission is to maintain an integrated national and international network of laboratories that can respond to acts of biological or chemical terrorism and other public health emergencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; The biological component of the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) is managed by the LRN program office in the Laboratory Response Branch (LRB), Division of Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response (DBPR), National Center for Preparedness, Detection and Control of Infectious Diseases (NCPDCID), Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to ensure preparedness and competency with LRN procedures, LRN Member Laboratories must participate in the Proficiency Testing (PT) Program provided by LRB. The LRN PT Program is designed to simulate real-world scenarios involving potential bioterrorism agents; requiring the preparation, packaging, and distribution of prepared biological samples in a variety of sample matrices. LRN PT challenges are distributed one to four times a year to as many as 200 LRN member laboratories.&nbsp;&nbsp; The LRB and associated Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology (BRRAT) Laboratory do not have the capacity or production capabilities to produce sufficient sample quantities to meet LRN PT Challenge requirements.&nbsp; Therefore, the purpose of this procurement is to obtain services from a qualified&nbsp;contractor to produce and distribute samples for a limited number of LRN Proficiency Testing challenges for biological threat agents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The total period of performance is 60 months from date of award.&nbsp; CDC will consider all responsible sources responding to this RFP.

<DESC>The US Fish and Wildlife Services, Region 7, Alaska intends to negotiate directly on a sole-source basis with University of Alaska Systems _ Fairbanks, for a project related to collection of invertebrate specimens which involve preparation and identification of specimens by a taxonomist familiar with Alaskan boreal invertebrates.  The details of the project scope and deliverables are as follows:
Title: Invertebrates/ Insects & Plants Study
Background:  Kanuti NWR began collecting terrestrial insects in 2002 to provide baseline information on species diversity, and insect collection was incorporated into a refuge-wide inventory program that began in 2004 and is expected to continue for at least the next decade.  In 2002, the temporary invertebrate curator at the University of Alaska Museum of the North (Museum) identified the insects collected that summer and returned them to the refuge.  The curator position was then vacant until July 2006.  Insects collected 2003 - 2005 were pinned, labeled, and identified by a private contractor and returned to the refuge.  Insects collected in 2006 and 2007 were pinned, indentified, labeled, and housed by the Museum.  The new curator corrected errors found for specimens collected in 2003 - 2005 and these insects, along with ones collected in 2002, are now stored at the Museum.  Data from all insects collected on the refuge were entered into the Museum database. 

Invertebrates/Insects:
Work Description:  We anticipate collecting approximately 2,000 invertebrate specimens per year.  Primary work involves preparation and identification of specimens by a taxonomist familiar with Alaskan boreal invertebrates.  Specimens will be prepared and stored following standard archival methodology and will be entered in an internet-available database that is linked to a mapping program.  Specimens will be held at a museum or other appropriate depository where they will be readily accessible for review by agency personnel, researchers, and members of the public who are focused on boreal or northern invertebrates.  Duplicate or surplus specimens will be returned to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), or if not needed by them, distributed as duplicates to another museum or appropriate depository.
1.	The contractor will offer suggestions and gear needed to undertake the best methods for collecting invertebrates in boreal forest communities.2.	Personnel or volunteers of USFWS, when available, will mount specimens on pins prior to sending them to the contractor.  This will involve initial on-site training at the facility with which the contractor is affiliated, and possible follow-up training as needed. If such USFWS personnel are not available to mount specimens, contractor staff will provide these services.3.	Contractor will identify specimens to the lowest taxonomic rank possible without consulting with an outside specialist.  4.	For specimens to be held as permanent vouchers at a museum or appropriate depository, the contractor will undertake or oversee the process of database entry, label printing and mounting, and storage of specimens in the invertebrate collection.  5.

DESCRIPTION: Naval Warfare Center Training Systems Division, NAWCTSD, in support of the Naval Air Systems Command, intends to issue a Single Award 5 year Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery contract on a sole source basis to Lockheed Martin, Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC) in Dallas, TX under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 ( c )(1) and in  accordance with FAR 6.302-1(b)(1)(i).  The requirement is for the contractor to provide support for fielded mission rehearsal systems, including software support and geospatial target area collection and data production for capabilities fielded as integrated software within the Naval Aviation Mission Planning Environment. Tactical Operational Scene (TOPSCENE) is the Navys program of record for Mission Rehearsal Scene Visualization for Naval Aviation.  Previous contracts have included acquisition of the fleets prototype Mission Rehearsal Devices to include the Silicon Graphics based Models 4000, 400, 4800, and PC based model 40, 48, and TTVS, as well as geospatial target area database production.  The legacy devices support geo-specific scene visualization, weapon and sensor specific simulation, and interoperability with legacy mission planning systems and software (JMPS, PFPS, etc).  Previous contracting effort, beginning in FY02, acquired transition of core visual and production technology to PC architecture, and geospatial database production, visual enhancements, and user interface enhancements supporting Naval Forces mission planning and rehearsal for the Global War on Terrorism.  Due to the proprietary nature of the run-time software, LMMFC is the only qualified vendor.  Personnel involved in the imagery collection/production requirement must be cleared with Top Secret Security Clearance with special access requirements for collection and production of Geospatial Imagery Intelligence products.  The proposed contract action is for support for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capabilities to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Contract Specialist Ayana Graham at ayana.graham@navy.mil or call (407) 380-4012.

<CONTACT>Carmen Berrios 850-234-4218 , or Contracting Officer Wanda Cutchin at 850-636-6140.
<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Themis Computer Incorporated, 3185 Laurelview Court, Fremont, CA 94538 for the acquisition of three (3) RES-32DCO Rugged Enterprise Servers.  The servers will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  It is a very new system that has just been installed at the Ingleside schoolhouse and USS Devastator this month.  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Themis Computer Incorporated is the sole manufacturer of these servers.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with this part installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PC has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure interim support parts; s! o, time is an issue.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly in time and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that the servers are acquired from Themis Computers. 
The Request for Quote (RFQ) number is N61331-09-T-9502.  Simplified Acquisition Procedures is the method of award for this procurement.  The NAICS code is 33411 with size standard of 1,000 employees.  The order shall be firm fixed priced with an expected delivery date on or around 19 Dec 2008.  The expected award date will be on or around 5 Dec 2008.  Delivery will be to the Naval Support Activity Panama City, Receiving Officer Building 100, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7001.  Delivery terms for this requirement are FOB Destination.  
In order to be eligible for award firms must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  Vendors may obtain information on registration in the CCR by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Please note that defense payment office may not make payment unless the contractor is established to receive electronic funds transfer (EFT).  EFT payments are based on the contractor's EFT information contained in the CCR database.  The NSWCPC has implemented Electronic Commerce (EC) in the acquisition area.  Therefore, this synopsis and any applicable amendments will be available at http://nswcpc.navsea.navy.mil/contracts/ztable/open_actions.html.  Vendors should regularly access the NSWCPC web site to ensure that they have downloaded all amendments.

<a href="mailto:boris.david@epamail.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
<DESC>NAICS Code: 541620   (Small Business Set-Aside).   In accordance with FAR Part 12 Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 Simplified Procedures, the U.S. EPA Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) requires a contractor to provide Indefinite Delivery/ Indefinite Quantity Consulting Services for evaluation of a Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM)/Exhaust Flow Monitor (EFM)/Micro-Proportional Dilution System (MPS) System, Sunset OC/EC Analyzer, and Interpretation of Existing Field Data produced by these instruments in EPA projects.  
EPA has recognized the need for on-board vehicle exhaust particulate mass (PM) emissions measurement.  Recent compliance actions against vehicle and engine manufacturers have demonstrated that mobile engine-powered equipment can be configured to emit low emissions under EPA test conditions, yet under "real-world" operating conditions, the equipment can emit 2 to 3 times EPA limits.  Furthermore, EPA needs real-world PM emissions data to create realistic air-shed models of mobile source emissions.  The National Academy of Sciences recently indicated that EPA must collect more real-world data in order to more accurately predict the effects of its own emissions regulations.
To address these requirements, EPA is developing methods to continuously monitor vehicle exhaust PM emissions.  EPA has identified a QCM/EFM/MPS and the Sunset OC/EC Analyzer as an on-board vehicle exhaust dilution system and PM monitor.  Specifically, EPA is interested in determining performance at PM levels typical of both diesel and gasoline engines operated under the proposed 2007 regulations.  Additionally, the EPA is interested in similar performance information and/or data from other mobil sources, including aircraft engines.
The contractor shall be an educated resource on QCM instruments and data with an emphasis onQA/QC protocols. Data reduction of QCM data from a Kansas City emissions study is completeand has been provided in draft form to EPA for analysis. The contractor shall address questionsthat may arise concerning interpretation of the data and QA procedures for the data.

The contractor shall provide guidance on the use of QCM and Proportional Sampling system forMobile Source emissions. The contractor shall review the implementation of the on-board QCMSystem and its sub-parts (EFM and MPS) for mobile source emissions measurements. EPAneeds an expert, experienced person familiar with using a QCM/EFM/MPS system for both laboratory and on-board tests with a vision toward developing a mobile source EPA test standard. The contractor shall also provide consultation on QCM/EFM/MPS set-up and operation. Theexpert shall also consult with the designer on the required data post-processor program.
The 2007 heavy duty in-use program has progressed to the measurement allowance and required manufacturer pilot programs which are within the memorandum of agreement of the legislation. The PM expert shall (a.)	Evaluate the details of the test plan decided upon by the measurement allowance steering committee. Inform EPA on any possible oversights in the test plan (This will entail travel to the EPA for discussions of the test plan.)(b.)	 Evaluate the data from the testing done with the Horiba, Sensors, and AVL PM in-use instruments submitted for approval in the measurement allowance test program. This includes any data taken with peripheral instruments such as the the PM generator, Dekati ELPI, the TSI SMPS, and the Sunset Lab's EC/OC analyzer.(c.)	be a technical support at the measurement allowance meetings (This will entail travel to the meetings.)(d.)	review all documents that are produced from those meetings and test program (This will entail travel to the EPA for discussions of those documents.)	The contractor shall be required to conduct technical assessments of up to twenty-fivedocuments (i.e., reports, studies, and publications acquired and/or provided to the contractor byEPA) regarding particulate matter emissions measurement from mobile sources. The subjects ofthese documents can include PM measurement test procedures, data collection, inventoryestimates, and algorithms to be used in estimators for PM from mobile sources. Theseassessments shall apply to both the use of the QCM and the current cooperative efforts betweenEPA and FAA to develop estimators for aircraft emissions. For each document assessmentrequest, the contractor shall provide a technical report. Additionally, a final report whichsummarizes all the requested assessments is required from the contractor. Also, the contractor'stechnical support is needed to provide technical expertise at meetings (and/or conference calls)on mobile source PM emissions measurement techniques and preparing for these meetings (this will entail travel to the meetings).
This procurement is a small business set-aside under NAICS code 541620 with a size standard of $7,000,000.  Award will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria.  The period of performance is anticipated to be a 12 month base and two 12 month option periods (3 years).  Any responsible small business source believing itself capable of providing the required Consulting Services may submit a fixed-rate proposal which shall be considered by the Agency.  The solicitation will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities Website www.fbo.gov  approximately 15 days after electronic posting of this synopsis.  Questions regarding this solicitation should be submitted in writing to David Boris via Fax (513) 487-2107 or email boris.david@epa.govSee Note 1

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>1)	CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract(s) is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide for the primary disciplines of Structural, Civil, Geotechnical, Hydraulic, Mechanical and Electrical engineering (each of equal priority); additional disciplines are Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Cost Engineering and Specification Writing. It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded by June 2009. This announcement may result in multiple awards and is open to all businesses regardless of size. If concurrent multiple contract awards are made, task orders will be allocated based upon the Contracting Officer's determination of the special qualifications of the firms; the nature of the work involved in the task order; and the immediacy of the work and availability of the firm. Distribution of the work will be a secondary consideration.  In the final selection process, the most highly qualified firms may be interviewed.  All interested A -E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent, consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The target subcontracting goals for this contract are as follows: a minimum of 23% of the contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 5% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses, 5% be placed with women-owned small businesses, 3.1% be placed with HUB Zone small business, and 1.5% be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. Large business firms that intend to do any subcontracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum goals on the SF330.  If a large business firm is selected for this contract, it will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiations. If the selected firm intends to submit a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale in the plan as to why the above goals cannot be met. The North American Industry Classification System code for this action is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4 million in average annual receipts. This contract will have a base period not to exceed one year and four one-year option periods, for a total IDIQ value not to exceed $12,000,000. The Contractor is guaranteed no less than $48,000 the first year and $24,000 for the option periods, if exercised.  Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. Work will be ordered by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. The District may award in the future IDIQ contracts to perform work that may also be encompassed by this announcement; the Contracting Officer will consider the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: Performance, capacity to accomplish the task order in the required time, specialized experience, professional qualifications and knowledge of the region.  If more than one firm is selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second contract, and so on. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tie breaker between firms considered as technically equal. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. As determined by the employees office location (not the location of the work).  Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract at the time of the original award.<BR><BR>2.

<DESC>CHILE: VENTANAS SMELTER HEAT RECOVERY SYSTEM PROJECT 

POC John Kusinerek, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Contact: Richard Aylwin, Director of Energy Efficiency, Codelco, Huerfanos 1270, Santiago, Chile.  Phone: +(56) 2 690 3378.

VENTANAS SMELTER HEAT RECOVERY SYSTEM PROJECT.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for a Ventanas Smelter Heat Recovery System for the Corporacin Nacional del Cobre de Chile (Codelco). 

The feasibility study would evaluate the viability of converting unused heat from the Ventanas smelter into steam energy.  

The project proposes to insert a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (boiler) into the copper refining process.  Gases produced during the refining process must be cooled in order to pass through pollution control equipment.  The energy currently being used for the gas cooling process is estimated at 45 million btu/hr or the equivalent of some 2.6 million gallons of fuel oil.  The new boiler will capture the heat, currently wasted, and cool the gases.  The recovered heat will also produce approximately 40,000lb/hr of steam.  With increased steam capacity, approximately 15 MW of electricity could be produced, if three additional boilers are installed.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $422,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 1:00pm (local time), December 29, 2008 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SOURCES SOUGHT.  It is the Governments intent to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Contract for the investigation and failure analysis of Category 1 Product Quality Deficiency Reports (CAT 1 PQDRs) on aircraft exhibits for the Aviation Engineering Directorate (AED) within the US Army Aviation and Missile Research Development and Engineering Center (AMRDEC).  A CAT 1 PQDR describes an unsafe condition, operational or maintenance procedure for an aircraft, mission related equipment, component or module, or repair part that may cause death, injury, or severe occupational illness, that would cause loss or major damage to a weapon system, critically restricts the combat readiness capabilities of the using organization, and which would result in a production line stoppage.  The priority level of these exhibits mandates that the failure analyses be performed in not more than 45 calendar days.  The analyses performed will provide the mode of failure and the root cause determination that includes a determination as to whether or not the pertinent parts in question meet dimensional and other requirements as documented in source drawings.  The proposed period of performance is from AUGUST 2010 through JULY 2015, and may involve performance of 10 to 20 failure analyses per year.<BR> <BR>Offerors must demonstrate the ability to perform CAT 1 PQDR failure analyses by providing at least three sample reports for similar work.  A complete listing of all current analytical equipment and tooling; the average turnaround time and capacity on similar projects; and a list of qualifications for current employees is also requested.  <BR><BR>The Government is seeking to determine whether two or more small businesses are capable of performing the work outlined in the description above.  The Government is asking for responses from all responsible Small Business sources that can demonstrate their capability to perform the work and provide the requested documentation pertaining to the sample report, equipment list and personnel qualifications by the closing date of this sources sought notice.  This information will be used to evaluate each sources capability to perform integration requiring the use of proprietary information and determine whether or not this acquisition will be designated as a small business set-aside or a full and open competition.   <BR><BR>The proposed contract listed herein is being considered for a 100% small business set aside, and is subject to the availability of funds.  By U.S. Law, participation in Small Business Set-Asides is restricted to U.S. small businesses; therefore, submission of information by foreign sources will not be honored.<BR><BR>The most recent AED effort was awarded on a sole source basis to Dayton T Brown under Contract W58RGZ-05-C-0318, a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, Basic Contract plus five one-year Options, with a total potential dollar value of approximately $46.6M.<BR><BR>This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement; market survey for information only, to be used for preliminary planning purposes.  Responses to this announcement are due no later than 1600 (CST) on 16 DECEMBER 2008.  Formal communication related to this Acquisition should be directed to Paula Parker, Contract Specialist.  You may fax, mail, or email the requested information to US Army Aviation and Missile Command, ATTN:  AMSCC-AVM-RD-B, Paula Parker/Research Development and Engineering Center, Building 5400, Room B142, Redstone Arsenal, AL  35898;  EMAIL: paula.parker1@us.army.mil; FAX NUMBER: (256) 876-7600.

The survey instrument includes a scoring framework from which the information obtained enables the Agency to calculate a score for each contractor.  This score will directly correlate to the providers satisfaction with their contractors performance of key business processes.  The results will provide CMS with a comprehensive review of contractor-provider business relations from the perspective of the customer or provider.  Based on the national survey results, the MCPSS will continue to be refined to a standardized instrument and scoring format for providing comparative information to help the Agency appropriately address provider concerns about Medicare contractors performance.   

CMS three main goals for the MCPSS are to: 
1.Provide feedback from providers to contractors so they may implement process improvement initiatives; 
2.Establish a uniform measure of provider satisfaction with contractor performance; and 
3.Satisfy Medicare Modernization Act (2003) requirements to measure provider satisfaction levels. 

Purpose: 
The MCPSS is an annual project.  It is designed to gather and report objective, quantifiable data on provider satisfaction with the FFS contractors who process and pay Medicare claims.  Medicare contractors are private companies that not only process and pay Medicare claims but also provide a variety of other services to enrolled Medicare providers.  

MCPSS is a standardized instrument administered every January to approximately 30,000 randomly selected providers, including physicians, health care practitioners, suppliers and facilities that serve Medicare beneficiaries across the country. CMS includes all Medicare FFS contractors in the national administration of the MCPSS.   

The survey instrument is composed of 65 close-ended questions and collects information on seven business functions of the provider-contractor relationship:  provider inquiries, provider outreach and education, claims processing, appeals, medical review, provider enrollment and provider audit and reimbursement.  At the end of each business function section of the survey, there is one open-ended question where the respondent has the opportunity to make a comment.  The results of the survey will enable CMS to establish performance standards, incentive payments, and make comparisons of provider satisfaction between contractors and, over time, improvements to the Medicare program.     
  
OMB has charged CMS with an 80% target response rate for the 2010 survey.   Because of the extensive marketing and outreach activities, the first two administrations of the MCPSS reached a 65 response rate.  In the last administration, or in 2008, MCPSS response rates reached 70%.  

The MCPSS findings are reported via an on-line archival and reporting system with limited use to FFS contractors.  Contractors receive an overall composite score as well as a score for each business function. These results are conveyed and updated via the on-line reporting tool with CMS controlled access.  The tool provides annual data, establishes trend analysis, and provides individualized process improvement tools for FFS contractors to aid in their efforts for making improvements to procedures and services for serving their providers.  A number of individualized reports with findings and process improvement grids are provided to each FFS contractor and as well as reports generated for public display. Data collection activities commence every January and the reports are released the following July. 

Westat, a Rockville-based organization, is the current contractor. The Provider Communications Group, specifically the Division of Provider Relations and Evaluations, under the Center for Medicare Management, is charged with the contracting oversight, administration and management of the MCPSS.   For more information, including copies of the yearly public reports and survey instrument, please visit the MCPSS website at www.cms.hhs.gov/MCPSS.

PALLETIZATION REQUIREMENT   8/15/2004

Palletization:  The shipping (transport) containers shall be palletized. The pallets shall be 48-inch length x 40-inch width, general purpose, four-way entry, flush stringer, and double-face non-reversible pallets.  The palletized load shall not exceed 2500 pounds in weight for shipments to the Eastern Distribution Center (Burlington).

The palletized load shall not overhang the pallet deck board edge by more than 1 inch and shall not exceed 53 inches in overall height (including pallet). Less than half pallet loads or loads shipped by small package carrier in acceptable transport packing need not be palletized. When less than full but more than a half pallet is used, the palletized load shall utilize proper bracing and/or reinforcement to ensure that the load can withstand two additional loads placed on it. 

Stacking:  A load-stacking test shall be performed once, at the beginning of the contract, for each different unitized or palletized load configuration. A fully palletized load shall be tested utilizing a total stack of three palletized loads, with all the proper bracing and/or reinforcement necessary to perform the test. There shall be no evidence of damage to the pallets, shipping containers or products when stack is tested on the rigid surface for a minimum of 24 hours, in compliance with all the National and Local Safety Regulations. The pre-tested palletized load configuration shall be duplicated using the same packaging materials, pattern, number of shipping (transport) containers, and procedures consistent throughout the duration of the contract. Palletized loads shall be stable and safe when handled with mechanical equipment by qualified personnel.

Materials:  All lumber used inside or outside a shipment shall be bark free. No used wood pallets with repaired components or stringers will be acceptable.

Unitization encompasses, but is not limited to, consolidation in a container, placement on a pallet or load base having forklift capability, or securely binding together. Shipments should be considered for unitization where appropriate or specified. 
Unitization of pallet load:  The palletized load shall be unitized and secured to the pallet to insure that the load arrives intact without product damage. The containers or items shall be placed in a suitable pattern to form a stable and balanced load. Vertical, horizontal or filler reinforcement shall be added as necessary to meet the stacking strength requirements. A palletized load shall be secured to the pallet by shrink or stretch wrapping, and/or, by steel or nonmetallic strapping. When steel or nonmetallic strapping is used, edge protectors shall be provided to prevent damage to the cartons when tensioning the strapping. As a minimum, two straps shall run lengthwise, two straps shall run widthwise, and two straps shall run around the girth of the palletized load. A palletized load shall be capable of protecting the products against damage in a multiple handling, transportation, and storage environment having distribution warehouses with rack systems that support the load/s overhead of warehouse personnel.

<DESC>The MK 138 Mod 1 Demolition Charge Assembly is designed primarily for underwater demolition operations, but may be adapted to other purposes.  This demo charge assembly consists of a Canvas Field Pack, MK4 Mod 1 and ten MK 35 Mod 1 Demolition Charges.  The Canvas Field Pack, Mk 4 Mod 1, is made of cotton duck, treated to resist fire, water, and mildew. The pack has a plastic flotation bladder sewed into the cover. This prevents possible loss of the bladder and keeps the pack in an upright position. The check valve can be operated to compensate for buoyancy changes caused by removing the charges. A tow ring is secured to the bottom of the pack. Vent holes are located in the bottom of the pack.  A 17-foot length of cotton sash cord is secured on one end of the pack. A flat metal hook is attached to one end of the pack and a snubber assembly is attached to the opposite end. The pack is equipped with an adjustable shoulder strap which facilitates carrying and towing under certain conditions.<BR><BR>The Mk 35 Mod 1 Demolition Charge is a rectangular shaped block of Composition C-4 weighing 2.0 pounds.  Composition C-4 is a plasticized explosive having the same consistency as putty at temperatures between -70 degrees F and +170 degrees F and is about 1.34 times as powerful as TNT.  The charge is contained in a cotton duck bag and is formed with a 9-foot length of detonating cord.  Three feet of this cord is embedded in the explosive charge; the remaining 6 feet is looped and folded under two retaining webs secured to the charge bag.  Approximately three feet of cotton sash cord and a flat metal hook are provided for lashing the charge to an obstacle.<BR><BR><BR>This survey is open to both large and small businesses. The NAICS Code for this announcement is 332993 Ammunition (except Small Arms) Manufacturing. The Small Business size standard is 1500 employees.

<DESC>Y -- SOURCES SOUGHT

The U. S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set-aside an acquisition for Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or Small Business concerns only.  The estimated magnitude of this construction project is more than $25,000,000.00.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this acquisition is 236220 and the small business size standard is $33.5 Million.  The estimated time for completion is 540 days.  The solicitation, when issued, will be formatted as a Request for Proposal (RFP) in accordance with the requirements designated by sections of the FAR 15.203 for a competitive negotiated procurement utilizing the authorized Two-Phase Design-Build selection procedures of FAR 36.3.  The acquisition is for the design and construction of a Rescue Swimmer Training Facility (RSTF) to include a Modular Egress Training Simulator (METS) or Dunker at the U. S. Coast Guard Support Center, Elizabeth City, NC

The project scope includes the design and construction of approximately a 50,000 gross square feet (GSF) facility to directly support the ATTC command in the training of the Coast Guards Rescue Swimmer program.  The RSTF will consist of two training pools; (1) a 25m x 50m training pool and (2) a 30ft x 60ft dunker pool; each with a durable, low maintenance pool finish.  The 25m x 50m pool will promote a safe training environment for all Rescue Swimmer training scenarios; particularly when working with parachutes.  This pool will also have many technological features to simulate the real-world environment to include jumps towers, rotor wash simulation, fog generation, dusk and night simulation, and a wave generator.  The RSTF will also include a Modular Egress Training Simulator (METS) or Dunker pool.  The Modular Egress Training Simulator (METS) is an advanced underwater escape training simulator.  The METS demonstrates real-time immersion and inversion, and features exit-specific technology that replicates more than a dozen types of fixed-wing and rotary aircraft.  In addition to the construction of two pools, the RSTF will also include properly sized support spaces.  These support spaces include segregated locker rooms for students and instructors, a wet storage room for training gear/aids, a lecture classroom, an inflatables laboratory, an oxygen laboratory, and instructor office space.  At the present time, the acquisition is expected to be issued under full and open competition procedures.  However, in accordance with FAR 19.1305 and FAR 19.14, if your firm is HUBZone or a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond by e-mail to Mrs. Donna Miller at donna.e.miller@uscg.mil or fax to (757) 852-3495.  In your response, include a positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this solicitation as a prime contractor.  Your response is requested by December 1, 2008.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone Small Business Set-aside, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business, Small Business concern or on an unrestricted basis will be posted on FEDBIZOPS at www.fbo.gov.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command, Program Manager for Training Systems (PM TRASYS), is seeking information regarding an Egress Trainer for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) configurations manufactured by Force Protection Incorporated (FPI).  The vehicle configurations are the MRAP category I (Cougar 4x4, Medium Mine-Protected Vehicle), category II (Cougar 6x6, Medium Mine-Protected Vehicle), and category III (Buffalo Mine-Protected Clearance Vehicle "MPCV").  The FPI MRAP variants are the only configurations under consideration for this effort.
The MRAP Egress Trainer (MET) shall provide egress training for vehicle occupants during situations resulting from vehicle rollover.  Vehicle occupants include the vehicle driver, crew, and passengers.  The MET shall provide conditions that will require the vehicle occupants to utilize cognitive and motor skills necessary to safely egress the vehicle and evacuate casualties in various angles of egress between 0 to 120 degrees. The MET shall simulate vehicle rollover conditions (side->top->side->bottom, not front end to back end) from 0 to 360 degrees.  The MET shall provide continuous rollover conditions that simulate multiple rollovers during a training exercise which are controlled by the instructor.  The instructor shall have the following controls: rollover start, rollover stop, rollover speed, audio distraction (explosions, enemy fire), smoke, and communications.  The instructor shall be able to communicate with the vehicle occupants via a speaker system.  The instructo! r shall be able to secure any exit location (doors and hatches) for each MRAP configuration (category I, II, and III) so that the vehicle occupant is unable to open the secured exit.  The MRAP category I and II has 3 doors (driver, co-driver, and rear crew double door) and 1 hatch topside.  The MRAP category III has 1 door (rear door) and 6 hatches topside.
The trainer shall replicate all the vehicle exits for each MRAP configuration (category I, II, III).  The interior shall replicate seat and seat locations, restraints, exit locations (doors and hatches "see specifics for each vehicle listed above"), driver steering wheel, gear shift, non-functional dash, non-functional headset and headset connections, as built obstacles and obstructions, footholds, and handholds for each MRAP configuration (category I, II, and III).   
One MET shall consist of an MRAP Category I, II and III configuration or the ability to simulate each configuration. There may be a minimum of 5 and maximum of 13 sites that require a MET trainer.  The quantity of MET may be a minimum of 5 and maximum of 18.  A site survey will be required for each trainer location to determine facility requirements.  Facility modifications will be performed by the successful offeror. Site locations may include Camp Lejeune, NC; Camp Pendleton, CA; Okinawa, Japan; Kaneohe Bay, HI; 29 Palms, CA; Fort Leonard Wood, MO.  The government does not own the drawings for the FPI MRAP vehicle configurations.
The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about the requirements stated above and determine if any existing MRAP Egress Trainers are already developed or if there is a possibility to assemble and deliver (in period of 5-12 months) a training device that will meet the capabilities listed above.
If you are interested and can meet the requirements stated above then please provide documentation that demonstrates to the Government how the requirements will be met. The response may include a video of an existing product that provides the functionality discussed and/or a simulation that demonstrates the capabilities of an existing product or a product that could be provided.
In addition, please provide the following information:

Identify potential dates and location for the Government to have a demonstration of the training device.-	A summary of the contractor's previous and current experience related to egress trainers, if applicable.   
The submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items/services, or for the government to pay for the information received.  No solicitation documentation exists at this time.
Please respond by email or in writing.  All questions and information should be addressed to Joann Wesley (Project Officer) or Fred Boehne (Contract Specialist).  The mailing address is PM TRASYS, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL  32826.NO PHONE CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED

<DESC><p>The 50th Contracting Squadron at Schriever AFB, Colorado hereby gives notice of a sole source contract award to Colorado Professional Resources, LLC. Notice was not made prior to contract award due to the exception found at FAR 5.202 (a)(2). In accordance with FAR 6.303 and 6.302-2, due to unusual and compelling urgency the 50th Contracting Squadron has placed a sole source contract award for Cheyenne Mountain Training System support. Full and open competition was precluded by this unusual and compelling urgency and any delay in award would have resulted in serious injury to the Government, as detailed in the attached Justification and Approval. Award was made under Contracting by Negotiation Procedures (FAR 15). This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals or quotes. A determination not to compete lies solely with the discretion of the Government. This announcement constitutes the only notice. The reference number is FA2550-09-C-8003. NAICS code for this purchase is 541511.
<p>The following clause applies to this acquisition: <br />5352.201-9101 Ombudsman. (AUG 2005)<br />(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.<br />(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).<br />(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen -<br />AFSPC/A7K<br />Address: Headquarters Air Force Space Command A7K, 150 Vandenberg Street / Suite 1105, Peterson AFB CO, 80914-4230<br />Phone #: (719) 554-5250<br />Fax #: (719) 554-5299<br />E-mail: a7k.wf@afspc.af.mil<br />Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.<br />(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.<br />(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.<br />(End of clause)</p>
<p>The closing date for this notice is Wed, 3 Dec 08. For more information contact Contracting Officer Capt Bryan D. Lamb at 719-567-4253 or e-mail at bryan.lamb@schriever.af.mil.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) intends to award a sole-source contract to The Tauri Group LLC for technical support services for the Arms Control Enterprise System (ACES).  This is a follow-on contract to the current task order issued to Applied Research Associates, Inc. (ARA), under Contract Number DTRA01-02-D-0066, Task Order 0003.  The Tauri Group LLC is a subcontractor to ARA under the existing task order.  DTRA intends to award a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract with a base period of one (1) year and four (4) one-year options to The Tauri Group LLC to provide highly specialized expert professional services essential to support ongoing ACES operations and maintenance activities to include software change report analysis and prioritization, software maintenance updates and technology refresh efforts, treaty data exchanges, and 24/7 user support.  The proposed contract will include an option to provide technical support as needed to any research, development, test and evaluation program for directed additional treaty data collection and reporting capability (modules) and/or upgrades.  Inherent in these services is the requirement for expert, detailed knowledge of arms control treaties and agreements, to include inspection, escort, and monitoring provisions, notification requirements, reporting requirements regarding treaty-limited equipment and treaty-limited items, interaction and potential impacts between modules, data exchanges, the US Government interagency process, and international treaty discussions/negotiations (particularly regarding data reporting/exchanges).  Also required is expert, detailed knowledge of other arms control data collection and reporting systems and their interaction with ACES.  Systems include the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Integrated Notification Application, the Navy Strategic Programs Automated Reporting Treaty Accountable Notification System, the Air Force Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty Tracking and Reporting System, the Inspection Planning Module, and the Compliance Monitoring and Tracking System.  The Tauri Group LLC is the only known source with extensive current and historical knowledge, experience, and expertise to perform this effort; thus, DTRA proposes to award this contract to The Tauri Group LLC on a sole-source basis.  This action will be executed in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  Responses to this notice of intent to award a sole-source contract to The Tauri Group LLC may be submitted within 15 days of publication of this notice; however, a determination by the Government not to compete this action at this time based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

Glitnir GeothermalResearchs 2008 United States Geothermal Energy Market Report  asserts thathuman capital will be a bottleneck to advancing geothermal energytechnologyand could delay development of Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS)technology.The limited capability for meeting this need is further illustrated by thecurrent lack of formal university degree programs.  The Federal governmentandindustry, together, must address the growing inadequacy of workforcecompetencies due to the small size of the existing geothermal industry andthecompetition for human resources, as the geothermal industry competes withtheoil and gas industry for qualifiedpersonnel.Future GTP funding and administrative efforts may focus on the followinggoals: Institute program activities affiliated with the development andretention ofthe geothermal-specific competencies Develop teaming opportunities with universities and industry to invest ingeothermal education programs Co-sponsor student design competitions with industry focused on criticaltechnology challenges for EGSPotential initiatives may include, but are not limited to: EGS curriculum - Competitively fund institutions of higher education todevelop geothermal educational curricula and degreeprograms/minors/specializations Educational scholarship program  Support student enrollment in programswithgeothermal development and curricula for education, research and/orinternships.  These programs may apply to undergraduates, graduatestudents,and post-docs Vocational training - Develop the next generation of skilled workers forwidespread geothermal facility construction and operation University cooperative education and professional internship program University student competition Allow students to solve real-life problems and implement solutions in thefield Co-sponsor with industry student design competitions focused on criticaltechnology challenges Co-sponsor student paper challenges to showcase student research in apublicforum and make connections to industry K-12 education modules  Provide early exposure to and curricula forgeothermal energy and technology. This may include supplementing the EnergyEfficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE) Education website Pilot education program Day programs/workshops at universities Innovative education models for post-undergraduate education

<DESC><p>The DOC NOAA NCEP Operational (OPS) and Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) High Performance Computing Systems (HPCS)<br />Request for Information (RFI) RFI-NCEP2009</p>
<p><br />The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) anticipates acquiring advanced high performance computing systems (HPCS) to meet its operational and research and development computing requirements.  This requirement includes the possibility of accommodating unanticipated additional internal NOAA HPC requirements as well as external partner agency's weather related HPC needs.  The new Operational Centralized Computing System (OCCS) will replace or augment the current Operational and the Research and Development HPCS platforms at the National Centers for Environmental Predictions (NCEP) headquartered in Camp Springs, Maryland.  The new replacement systems will be known as the OCCS (operational environment) and the O-R&amp;D (research and development) HPCS and will provide primary resources needed to carry out NOAA's operational and research missions.  One of the primary objectives of the acquisition is to have the same technical configuration, i.e., HW, operating systems, etc. for both the OCCS and O-R&amp;D HPCS.  NOAA requires the vendor to provide a complete and fully integrated system solution.  This requirement facilitates and accelerates the process of transitioning codes developed in the O-R&amp;D environment to running as part of NCEP's production or operational suite of products.</p>
<p>Increased computational power is essential for NOAA to meet its strategic goals related to weather, climate, air quality, coastal and ocean resource management, and national commerce support, thereby providing improved service to the public.  NOAA anticipates contract award and initial system delivery in early FY2011.  An OCCS/O-R&amp;D HPCS Acquisition Team ("the Team") has been formed within the Department of Commerce. The RFI documents which describe this project are being made available via the Internet at the Project Web Site, http://www.ncep.noaa.gov/ccs.  Interested parties should continue to monitor this web site for additional information concerning this project.</p>
<p>NOAA is seeking varied concepts and innovative approaches to obtain the needed computing systems within the time frame and requirements. The RFI documents are intended to provide the high-performance computer industry with a general overview of the requirements and time frames, as well as to open a formal communication channel between industry and the Team.  The Team has provided a draft Statement of Need (SON) on the Project Web Site, including information on how to obtain initial benchmark codes.  The Team welcomes industry comments, questions and suggestions that will aid it in developing its acquisition strategy and finalizing the SON.</p>
<p>The projected budget for this acquisition is shown in the table below.</p>
<p>Projected Budget By Fiscal Year ($M)<br />(subject to availability of funds) <br /> 2011	2012	2013	2014	2015	2016	2017	2018	2019<br />Equipment and Maintenance (Base)	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M	$26M</p>
<p>The Team will consider input received in response to this RFI as it continues to develop the SON and the Request for Proposals (RFP).  The Team does not anticipate the need for a pre-proposal conference, but if one is deemed necessary, information will be posted on the Project Web Site accordingly.</p>
<p>The Team may conduct one-on-one communications with interested vendors in an effort to benefit fully from industry responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>Parties interested in providing information that the Team may use in developing the Government's technical or acquisition approach should review carefully the draft Statement of Need and supporting documents referenced in the draft Statement of Need, all of which are available at the Project Web Site.<br /> <br />One of the purposes of this RFI is to provide vendors with initial benchmark codes that will give an indication of the type of model programs that may be expected to run on both of NOAA's new OCCS and O-R&amp;D HPCS.  A complete list of the major model programs and the proposed schedule is available at the Project Web Site.  Instructions for obtaining the benchmark codes are available at the Project Web Site. The Team requests that vendors submit their benchmark test results with their RFI response.  This will give NOAA an indication of the performance capabilities of each vendor's recommended computing resources.  One of the principal outcomes of vendor/government dialog will be to ensure that viable approaches are considered during the competition.  The Government may therefore utilize the information provided to refine its acquisition strategy to maximize competition among viable acquisition alternatives.</p>
<p>It is not the Government's intent to disclose vendor proprietary information and trade secrets to the public.  The information submitted by vendors during the pre-solicitation period may be used by the Government in preparing its RFP and finalizing the SON, provided this can be done without disclosing proprietary vendor information that is protected from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations.&nbsp; Proprietary information should be marked as such.</p>
<p>Interested vendors should respond in writing to the following topics. Recommended page lengths are identified in parentheses at the end of each question.  Total response to this RFI should be limited to 20 pages, which provides flexibility to extend some answers beyond the recommended length, if needed.  Vendors who submit written responses may be invited to augment their written responses with a 2-3 hour oral presentation in early 2009.  Vendors responding to this RFI and who are interested in making a presentation to the Team, please notify the Contracting Support Office, Mr. Richard Parkerson, Contract Specialist, via e-mail at richard.parkerson@noaa.gov by 15 December 2008.  The Team will make a decision on which vendors to invite to make presentations.  Please address the following questions and concerns in the RFI submission:</p>
<p>1. Keep in mind that NOAA is looking to acquire a &lsquo;complete and fully integrated' system solution, i.e., a complete package which describes the Vendor's ability to provide this complete system solution.  Briefly describe the involvement Vendor's organization has had in providing HPC systems to Vendor's customers.  Has Vendor's HPC involvement included weather/climate applications? Describe relationships Vendor has or has had with particular HPC, storage, communications, software, and facilities providers in support of Vendor's HPC involvement.  Any references Vendor can provide would be appreciated. (1 page)<br /> <br /> 2. Describe Vendor organization's ability to provide engineering support to NOAA HPC users in the Washington, DC and Fairmont, WV areas. (1/2 page)<br /> <br /> 3. Describe any anticipated HPC technology developments (i.e. compute, storage, network) that NOAA should be aware of to ensure that our SON elicits the best responses from the vendor community.  Has Vendor's organization had a role in HPC Grid applications? (1 page)<br /> <br /> 4. Describe the largest file size Vendor's system can handle now, whether this is a hardware or software limitation and projections for the largest file size during the base and option periods of performance.

<p>The NCTR/FDA/HHS has a requirement for blood samples from human patients before, during and perhaps after treatment with DNA damaging alkylating antineoplastic drugs or radiation.

Patients treated systemically with alkylating (or other DNA damaging agents) individually or as a component of a drug cocktail for treatment of their conditions. If several patients treated with the same drug are available, then the patients prescribed higher cumulative dose of the drug should be selected. The chemicals include the following drugs (generic or trade names): Thiotepa, Cyclophosphamide (cytoxan).<br />7. If the above options are not available, then the following drugs will be acceptable: Melphalan, Cis-platin, Busulfan (myleran), Streptozocin.<br />8.

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the internet at http://www.ccr.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

Technical quality, including past performance, will be considered more important than cost or price. Warranty information, as well as life cycle cost considerations, will be included in the best value determination.  
Prices proposed will be examined to establish price reasonableness. 
In the case of an offeror with respect to which there is no information on past contract performance, or with respect to which information on past contract performance is not available, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past contract performance. In other words, past performance will be treated as neutral. This will be accomplished by giving a new firm the average score of the other competing offeror's and evaluating the proposal in accordance with the other stated evaluation criteria, (FAR 15.608(2)(iii)).	While price will be a factor in the award decision, the award may not necessarily be made to that offeror submitting the lowest price. Likewise, award will not necessarily be made for technical capabilities that would appear to exceed those needed for the successful performance of the work. A thorough examination will be made to determine an offeror's adequate understanding of the Scope of Work related to proposal presentation, price (including materials) and other factors considered. The question to be decided in making the final selection will be whether proposals scoring better are worth the dollar difference (if any).
As proposals become more equal in their technical merit, the evaluated cost or price becomes more important. As the technical merit and the evaluated cost or price become essentially equal, other factors may become the determining factor.
The government will consider other factors, as listed below in descending order of importance, secondary to technical, geographical disbursement, and cost or price;
(1) HubZone small business concerns;(2) Small business concerns which are also minority owned and operated; (3) Women-owned firms; and(4) Service-disabled veteran-owned small business firms.
In addition to the evaluation of technical merit, the cost, or price, and other factors, the standards for determining an offeror's responsibility as set forth in FAR 9.104-1, will be examined and considered. Additional factors which are not specifically set forth in this solicitation, but which are prerequisites for award as implied by law, regulation or public policy will be considered in the determination of an offeror's acceptability.
Attachment I, Intention to Propose, should be submitted on or before December 4, 2008.  Attachments C.1, C.2, C.3, and/or C.4, Past Performance Questionnaires, should be submitted on or before December 11, 2008.  Only Numbers I and II of the Past Performance Questionnaires should be filled out.  The government will obtain the past performance information from the references provided.  All proposals should be submitted in an original and four copies for receipt no later than 4:00 p.m., EST, December 18, 2008, and shall be clearly marked with Request for Proposal Number N1141090004.  Offerors are hereby notified that if your proposal is not received by the date and time and at the location specified in this announcement that it will be considered late in accordance with FAR Part 52.212.1(f).  
Past performance information and proposals should be sent to the National Park Service; Harpers Ferry Center; Office of Acquisition Management; Attention: Melody Wolfe, Administrative Specialist; Request for Proposal Number N1141090004; P.O. Box 50; Harpers Ferry, West Virginia 25425-0050.  Proposals by telephone transmitted facsimile (fax) will not be accepted.

<DESC>This BAA seeks proposals for development of electrically actuated systems for future submarine platforms.  Potential benefits include construction and in-service cost reduction through elimination of shipboard hydraulic systems and ancillary equipment.  Systems will also support future condition based maintenance with integrated sensors and prognostics.  Significant challenges include the achievement of a high torque/force density while maintaining stringent signature requirements, reliability, and shock tolerance.  Additional challenges may result if portions of the system are external of the pressure hull.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).

Are either pick up points beyond a security desk that would force us to relinquish our firearms? 2.      Will our guards be forced to be escorted to the pick up point?3.      Is there anything else we need to know about that would add additional time to our crew once we arrive at the location?4.      We only authorize our crew to sign the Deposit Log that we issue to all our customers.  Is that an issue?5.      We certainly can and will take full responsibility for any deposit(s) we sign for at either location.  However, for pricing purposes if you could give me the average daily Cash and Check breakdown amount I can present you with a more competitive price.  Otherwise I would have to assume that we will be required to insure $1M per pick up which would be quite costly.6.      Time of pick up and delivery of deposits is very restrictive. Can the locations be more flexible?  For example, the vast majority of our customers are set up with "in route" service (service can be provided anytime throughout the customer's hours of operation).  This allows us to be even more competitive with our pricing.  This is very important to know because there is a very good chance that we would not be able to satisfy the very restrictive times noted in the scope of services. 
 Answers: 1.  No
2.  no
3.  no
4.  no
5.  Maximum liability is $50,000 per pick up/delivery per day.  If we had a deposit that exceeded this amount this office would make the deposit themselves.   
6.  I understand the times are quite restrictive, but they are very important.<BR><BR>

Are either pick up points beyond a security desk that would force us to relinquish our firearms? 2.      Will our guards be forced to be escorted to the pick up point?3.      Is there anything else we need to know about that would add additional time to our crew once we arrive at the location?4.      We only authorize our crew to sign the Deposit Log that we issue to all our customers.  Is that an issue?5.      We certainly can and will take full responsibility for any deposit(s) we sign for at either location.  However, for pricing purposes if you could give me the average daily Cash and Check breakdown amount I can present you with a more competitive price.  Otherwise I would have to assume that we will be required to insure $1M per pick up which would be quite costly.6.      Time of pick up and delivery of deposits is very restrictive. Can the locations be more flexible?  For example, the vast majority of our customers are set up with "in route" service (service can be provided anytime throughout the customer's hours of operation).  This allows us to be even more competitive with our pricing.  This is very important to know because there is a very good chance that we would not be able to satisfy the very restrictive times noted in the scope of services. 
ANSWERS1.  No
2.  no
3.  no
4.  no
5.  Maximum liability is $50,000 per pick up/delivery per day.  If we had a deposit that exceeded this amount this office would make the deposit themselves.   
6.  I understand the times are quite restrictive, but they are very important.<BR><BR>

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR LEASEPURCHASE OF TWO LATHE MILLING MACHINES.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) intheir quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and awritten amendment will not be issued.The purpose of this amendment is to answer questions that were asked before due date.1. Question: Item 15 requests final installation.  Does this mean we the contractor wouldprovide rigging and handling of the equipment, electrical service, and air service to themachine, or will the facility be handling these items?	A typical "final installation"for us includes final leveling of the machine, verification of correct power and airsupply, and initial commissioning of the machine.   Answer: MSFC will provide all electrical, crane, air, etc. We request awardee to providelifting procedures along with lifting hooks and verify the installation of machine. 2. Question:   Which shop will the machine be placed in?  Answer:  BLDG 4705 3. Question: Item 5 requests a chip auger or conveyor.	We can provide either a chipauger, or a belt type chip conveyor, which item does the government prefer? Answer:  Chip Auger 4. Question:  Requested delivery is 2 weeks ATP.  Current leadtimes are running 5-7weeks.	Is this acceptable?  Answer: Propose your best delivery possible. 5. Question:  Do you actually require delivery of the requested equipment 2 weeks afterthe vendor receives your purchase order ?Answer:  See question 4.6. Question:  Regarding Small Business Set Aside.   We are a small business but themachine we would offer in response to the RFQ is manufactured by a business that islarge.	We normally work on a commission basis with this company so the manufacturerusually does the billing for the equipment.  Would you require that we do the billingsince we are the small business or will the fact that we are still connected with theorder be acceptable to qualify as a small business ?Answer:  MSFC will only pay the winning vendor, whether the vendor is large or small. Third party invoices will not be paid.7. Question:  We wish to clarify the axis travel definition:  X axis references movementleft to right of the spindle relative to the work piece. Y axis references movementvertically (up/down) of the spindle relative to the work piece and Z axis movement of thespindle and tool towards and away from the work piece. Answer: They are correct on the directional travels listed as to X Y and Z, which we wereaware of.8. Question:  Our reason for asking is that the dimensions as listed, X axis = 30, Yaxis = 20, Z axis = 26 eliminate six (6) of the most recognized nine (9) majormanufacturers of 500mm Pallet Size Horizontal Machining Centers. Simply by switching theaxis definition of X and Y several more manufacturers (including Okuma) can providegreater capacity than specified without affecting the available work zone. The Okuma MA-500 provides axis travels of 27.5 X axis and 35.4 Y axis, so we are within2.5 of the X axis target and provide 35.4 of Y axis travel, exceeding the minimum by15.4.	Y axis capability (part height) is a critical factor when fixtures and part sizeare taken into consideration. Answer: We can drop the min. travel to 27" in the x-axis.9. Question:  There are no specifications for the CNC control that we can locate. As thisis the brain of the machine and each manufacturer provides significant variation instandard capability we would appreciate more details. Features to consider wouldinclude, operating system (Windows XP or proprietary), Program storage, Querty keyboard,Ethernet, Color graphic display, processor speed, encoder design, minimum programmableincrement etc.Answer: Controller Specs:   RS-232 Port   Hard Drive with Ethernet Interface   USB support- (flash stick)   Operating System- Windows XPThe due date for receipt of offers is not extended.

<DESC>This amendment provides answers to questions regarding the solicitation from prospective offerors. The hour and date specified for receipt of proposals HAS NOT been extended. 
Offerors must acknowledge receipt of this Amendment by identifying this amendment number and date of the amendment on each copy of the offer submitted.  Failure to receive your acknowledgement may result in the rejection of your offer.  Except as provided herein, all terms and conditions of the solicitation remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This amendment does not designate a suggested cut off date for the submittal of questions regarding this BAA.  However, if questions are received one week prior to the due date for the submission of proposals,  we cannot guarantee a response.  In addition, the proposal submission due date will not be extended.

Questions and Answers (numbering continued from Amendment #1)

 24.  Page 8, PART I, THE SCHEDULE, SECTION C, ARTICLE C.2., Reporting Requirements, paragraph a.5., requires that the source code be delivered at the completion of the project.  Some of the work that has gone into the development of the platform we propose to use was developed at our own expense.  Is it absolutely necessary that source code be delivered at the completion of the contract?

Response:  The BAA incorrectly specified that source code be delivered at the completion of the contract.  Therefore, SECTION C, ARTICLE C.2., Reporting Requirements, paragraph a.5., is deleted in its entirety.  Please note, however, that contractors must be willing to share the necessary documentation with the Government in order to prepare a pre-Investigation Device Exemption (IDE) and a Pre-market Approval (PMA) package for regulatory approval of the HIV POC diagnostic device.   

25.  ATTACHMENT 5, RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES, Table 1, would alternate power sources compatible with a resource limited setting be acceptable?

Response:  Yes, but the device must function as a POC diagnostic device in a resource limited setting.  

26.  ATTACHMENT 5, RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES, page 2, Table 1, issue: Cost.  We would propose an HIV test that will concurrently assess multiple independent gene targets.  The specification indicated a $12 - $20 range per result.  As our platform would provide multiple results concurrently is the cost per result ($12 -$20) or is it simply $12- $20 for all results.

Response:  We are focused on diagnosing HIV and therefore are unwilling to pay for the cost of unrelated tests.  

27.  ATTACHMENT 5, RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES, page 2, Table 1, issue: Full Set of Specifications.  If we cannot hit all specifications listed in Attachment 5, Research and Technical Objectives, Table 1, is it worth our continued interest in responding to the RFP?

Response:  The specifications listed in Table 1 are estimates provided to offerors to assist with proposal preparation.  They are not meant to be restrictive.  Therefore, Attachment 5, page 2, the paragraph preceding Table 1, Key Specifications and Ranges for a Rapid, HIV POC Diagnostic Device, is hereby revised to read as follows:

  The specifications required for the diagnostic device to be successfully implemented in the field are summarized in Table 1.  These specifications are estimates provided to offerors to assist with proposal preparation and are not meant to be restrictive.  

28.  Amendment 1, responses to questions 7 and 16, refer to a NIAID sponsored workshop entitled "Novel Technologies in Rapid HIV-1 Viral Detection" at NIH on July 12-13, 2007.  Is a transcript of the meeting  available?

Response:  A Summary Report of the meeting is attached.  Also, links to videocast of the two day meeting can be accessed via the following websites: 

Novel Technologies in Rapid HIV-1 Viral Detection (Day 1): 
http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=13930

Novel Technologies in Rapid HIV-1 Viral Detection (Day 2): 
http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=13932 

29.  Page 16, SECTION H  SPECIAL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, ARTICLE H.3. HUMAN
     MATERIALS (ASSURANCE OF OHRP COMPLIANCE) speaks to a question about the exclusion of human subjects from this contract.  It was presumed that obtaining blood samples from HIV infected and non-infected individuals be permitted under this contract.....to your knowledge, is that correct?

Response:  The resulting contract is expected to obtain, receive, collect, store, modify or otherwise utilize human materials.  A properly completed Protection of Human Subjects Assurance Identification/IRB Certification/Declaration of Exemption, Optional Form OMB No. 0990-0263 (or a self-designated form) certifying IRB review and approval of the protocol from which the human materials were obtained must be received from the contractor/subcontractor before research or collection involving human materials may be conducted under the contract.

30.  Page 4, SECTION B  SUPPLIES OR SERVICES AND PRICES/COST, ARTICLE B.1. BRIEF 
        DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES, addresses NIAIDs intended target location for this device.  In other words, the question was posed as to whether this device is planned to be used more domestically or more in developing countries?

Response:  The diagnostic technology must demonstrate feasibility for use in resource-limited settings and In POC clinics without the use of supporting laboratory equipment such as centrifuges, vortexes or pipettes.

31.  One of our primary questions is related to the current state of completion that will be considered by the reviewers.  In short, will the reviewers prefer to select an existing technology that is currently in use in other market areas or is the preference for a new technology that addresses the specific needs of the solicitation, even though the new technology is not currently available for use? To put it even more simply, is the purpose of the solicitation to fund promising new technology to bring it to a state that can be commercialized or is the solicitation targeted for existing technology that can be modified to suit the requirements?

Response:  ATTACHMENT 5 TABLE 1, RESEARCH AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES, addresses how your response to the solicitation can be targeted at either new or a modification of existing technology providing it meets the  POC device specifications. The product development activities should include your plan to submit an IDE and subsequently a PMA package to FDA as listed in Attachment 5.  Your selection of a platform should plan on getting this accomplished in a 5 year time frame.

32.  Article I.2(c) Authorized Substitution of Clauses on page 25 states that FAR Clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data-General (December 2007) is deleted in its entirety.  However, Article I.3 (a) (8)-(10) 
  Additional Contract Clauses on page 26 states that FAR Clause 52.227-14, Rights in Data  General (December 2007) as well as Alternate IV and Alternate V are incorporate[d] . . . by reference into the contract.  Can you clarify whether FAR Clause 52.227-14 is incorporated in the contract?

Response: FAR Clause 52.227-14 is incorporated in the contract, as well as Alternate IV (JUN 1987) and Alternate V (JUN 1987).

33.  Article C.3 on page 3 makes reference to FAR Clause 52.227-11, Patent- Rights-Ownership by the Contractor.   This clause is also referenced in Article F.1 (pg.11) and on page 5 of Attachment 6.  However, Article I..3(a)(7) on page 26 states that FAR Clause 52.227-13, Patent  Rights-Ownership by the Government is incorporate[d] . by reference into the contract.  These two clauses are mutually exclusive, or at least in tension with one another.  Which clause do you intend to include?  The multiple references to 52.227-11       make it appear that this clause is the intended one, and it would also be our preference.

Response:  The Government is not interested in retaining possession of an invention, therefore FAR clause 52.227-13, Patent Rights-Ownership by the Government is not applicable and is hereby deleted from the Broad Agency Announcement.   However, FAR clause 52.227-11 is applicable with respect to any subject invention in which the Contractor has acquired title, the Federal agency has the right to a   nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced each subject invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States (including any Government agency).
 
34.  Page 8, issue:  Source code.  If the source code for the contractors instrument is proprietary and was developed at the organizations expense, the contractor would not be willing to share this with the goverrment.  If a contractor is unwilling to share source is it worth their effort to respond to the RFP?

Response:  A stated in the response to question no. 24, Article C.2 (a) (5) on page 8 is deleted in its entirety.  Also, on page 4 of ATTACHMENT 6, REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER DELIVERABLES, the paragraph titled Source Code and Object Code is deleted in its entirety.

35.  Is there a page limit?

Response:  The page limit for the technical proposal is 150 pages.  The specific details are found in Section J of the RFP, again in Attachment 1, page 2.

36.  Would NIH vaccine center provide clinical samples to test for vaccine efficacy testing by this POC test?  We have developed a prototype for sensitive ultra rapid test for HIV detection, which can be modified for testing vaccine efficacy.  Question is how do we test these devices for their usefulness of vaccine efficacy?

Response:  A mechanism for requesting archived specimens from previous vaccine trials is available at http://www.HVTN.org.  This information is stated in Attachment 5, Research and Technical Objectives, bottom of page 1.  The offeror should attempt to establish this collaboration and if this proposal is successful, the NIAID Program Staff will ensure that specimens are available through NIAID-sponsored network clinical trials. 

37.  It is unclear to me how it is possible to develop a human in vitro diagnostic test/device without performing Human Subject research?  Naturally all required FWA, IRB and other oversight would be obtained for all Institutions involved both domestic and international. Must the project really not include Human Subjects?  It would be impossible to develop a test without a component of the assessment involving human subjects.  Could you clarify this?

Response:  We anticipate that you will obtain or request archived human specimens from previous or ongoing human clinical trials to evaluate the diagnostic devise.  This solicitation does not have funds for the purpose of conducting a new clinical trial.  Is there a reasons that the proof-of concept, validation, and test-of-concept studies cannot be done with achieved specimens?  Because we anticipate that Offeror's will use existing specimens which are not individually identifiable from the original source, this research is not classified as human subjects research.

**Please note:  Email submissions are accepted and encouraged**


Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network (CROWN)
Systems Development & Maintenance

Introduction:  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide systems development and maintenance services to support the Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network (CROWN) application group.

History:  The Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-enabled Network (CROWN) application group, supports the End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Network program, ESRD dialysis providers, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) community.  CROWN is an application group currently consisting of the Renal Management Information System (REMIS), the Standard Information Management System (SIMS), and the Vital Information System to Improve Outcomes in Nephrology (VISION) along with all associated databases and architecture.  In February 2009 the first version of two new systems, (CROWNWeb) and the QualityNet Identity Provisioning System (QIPS), will be placed in production.  These new systems will become part of the CROWN application group and SIMS and VISION will be retired.

Prior to CROWN, each ESRD Network was responsible for developing solutions to meet the data entry and reporting requirements of their Statement of Work.  Besides the obvious inefficiencies of redundant systems and costs, each ESRD Network had different competencies related to automated data processing (ADP) activities.  Since the inception of CROWN, the functions of CROWN have encompassed support, standardization, and development of data, software, and standards for the ESRD Network community.  With the release of CROWNWeb V1.0, CROWN will continue to evolve with innovative technology to meet the challenges of supporting and interfacing directly with the ESRD Network community and surrounding healthcare industry.

The CROWN User Community refers to the ESRD Networks, ESRD dialysis facilities, CMS Central and Regional Offices, and other organizations/partners that may be incorporated in support of CMS initiatives.  This application group services the daily, ongoing support that the CROWN User Community needs to fulfill their contractual requirements in a manner supportive of an ongoing quality improvement program, a legislatively mandated ESRD patient registry (See Public Law 95-292, Section (c)(1)(A); 42 CFR, Chapter IV, Part 476; and Public Law 92-603, Section 299I), and the 2008 ESRD Provider Conditions for Coverage.

The current contractor that develops and maintains the CROWN application group is Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC).  The estimated level-of-effort for this work is approximately 75,000 hours per year.

Describe the work:  The contractor shall provide a program management team that assists CMS in managing the CROWN development and maintenance efforts; identifies and reports to CMS any potential risk factors that may inhibit or impede the performance of any task; facilitate the development of new system releases; assists CMS with the management of each product; manages timelines; ensures the full development of business requirements and system requirements in the format and with the specific tools approved by CMS; assists in the preparation of white papers, presentations, position papers, etc. to enable CMS to make appropriate, efficient, effective decisions/options; develops and maintains program management plans.

The vast majority of business requirements for the CROWN application group are collected and defined by another contractor; however, the contractor for this work shall participate in the review and refinement of these business requirements and then shall perform a system and resource impact analysis for each requirement. The work during this phase will culminate in the setting of scope for the next release.  The business requirements defined during the Business Requirements Definition phase shall be translated by the contractor into specific application requirements through the inventory and catalogue of functional requirements  functional requirements must be traceable back to the business requirements. These definition phases shall follow standard SDLC processes, procedures, and documentation guidelines.

3. The contractor shall coordinate Joint application Development (JAD) meetings and manage all administrative tasks for these meetings.  This includes facilitation, agendas, minutes, etc.
4.  The contractor shall assist CMS with project management of all products through the System Development Life Cycle.

<DESC>This is amendment #2 to subject solicitation. First amendment issued 28 oct 2008. 
The purpose of this amendment is to change the requirement to Brand Name Sensor Systems Antennas or equal.  This is a synopsis for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12, in conjunction with FAR 15.  GSA FAS/AASD has a requirement to support the Armys Blue Force Tracking Aviation with brand name Sensor Systems 301 and GPS Antennas or equal for integration and fielding of rapid deployment systems. To accomplish this, it is desired to initiate an IDIQ contract with base year minimum requirements of 50 and maximum of 750 for both items.  The first and second year options minimum requirements are 50 and 1000 for both items.  The products are unique to Army situation awareness systems and have been qualified for Safety of Flight / Airworthiness Release.

Failure to show proof that the or equal product works on theses systems can render the quote non-responsive.  These Antennas remove the dependency between host application proprietary communication systems, and are critical to Aviation missions.  New equipment only, NO remanufactured products, and NO gray market items. Ensure that all items will be covered by the manufacturers warranty.

<DESC>PEO Soldier has identified the need to produce and field the next generation helmet sensors to improve the sensors operational effectiveness for six brigade equivalents.<BR>The Helmet Sensor as a device will be coupled and integrated with a soldier<BR>helmet and will not present any harm to the individual soldier wearing the<BR>device nor interfere with any other helmet components or systems. This<BR>miniaturized device, when employed, will quantitatively measure rigid body<BR>motion responses associated with kinetic energy blasts and impact behavior.<BR>The device records and measures the magnitude and direction of both<BR>translational and angular accelerations. The device when operational and<BR>activated will discriminate between normal head motions and impacts<BR>observed in typical field activities, as well as discern high energy dynamic<BR>events when the helmet is exposed to ballistics impacts, blast pressures, and<BR>shock waves. The Helmet Sensor device will be an operationally multifunctional<BR>device fully capable of transmitting data captured either by means<BR>of using a wireless technique and/or via a standard computer USB module<BR>connection. Soldiers and supporting personnel will be able to employ a data<BR>retrieval system using automated information technologies to transmit device<BR>field data measured, recorded, and stored by a central processing unit. The<BR>finished system will be interoperable and interface with standard DoD<BR>hardware and software systems and effectively operate with existing DoD<BR>communication servers and portals.<BR>The government requires sample production demonstration models submitted<BR>with offers in compliance with the purchase description provided. The best<BR>value award for the Fixed Priced ID/IQ contract will be based on performance<BR>based acquisition techniques and responses including five volumes which are:<BR>1) Technical, which includes the offerors performance work statement in<BR>response to the Statement of Objectives, limited to 50 pages<BR>2) Quality assurance plan with performance requirements summary and<BR>contract master schedule, limited to 50 pages (resumes included and not<BR>limited in page count)<BR>3) Past performance (forms provided)<BR>4) cost/price data, and<BR>5) Small business subcontracting plan.<BR>Follow the URL to see the curent Purchase Description.

<DESC>***NOTICE: SOLICITATION #08ERSS0022, BALTIMORE MD WELL DRILLING PROJECT HAS BEEN CANCELLED IN ITS ENTIRETY.***

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is announcing an observation-well drilling and installation program in the Gwynns Falls watershed of southeastern Baltimore County, Maryland, an area underlain by saprolite and metamorphic bedrock.  Contractors will be invited to bid on the job, which will include the installation of about 40 relatively shallow observation wells using either the air-rotary or air-hammer drilling method.  The wells will range in depth from about 30 feet to 125 feet and they will be constructed similar to private homeowner water wells.  A shallow and a deep well will be installed at each of about 20 sites that will be selected by the USGS.  The well-installation program will take place over a 4-week period in November or December of 2008.  The work shall be performed in Baltimore County, Maryland, in accordance to the specifications in the Statement of Work for Drilling and Installation of a new well.
