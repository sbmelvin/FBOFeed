<DESC>The Acquisition Management Division (AMD) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), on behalf of the Surface and Microanalysis Science Division, intends to procure a Cathodluminescence (CL) MonoCL3+ system with XiCLone & MSM to be installed on and integrated with the existing FEI Quanta 200 F Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope, on a sole source basis from Gatan, Inc. of Warrendale, PA. NIST intends to use simplified acquisition procedures under FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items (as extended by Section 822 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008, Public Law 110-18).     
		 
This equipment will expand the capability of and functionality of NIST’s existing Quanta 200 F Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope.  
  
The general mission of the NIST/Surface and Microanalysis Science Division (SMSD)  is to provide research, reference materials, and data to support accurate, sensitive and selective analysis of the spatial distribution of chemical species relevant to industrial and environmental processes.  

The Division has the need to purchase a Cathodoluminescence Microanalysis System for its FEI Quanta 200 F Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope  (Quanta).  CL is the study of the light produced by the impact of electron beam on a specimen. The CL system will be used for high resolution imaging, spectroscopy, and spectral imaging.  This system will enable improvements in the identification and 
chemical characterization of unknown materials at nanometer spatial scales with major, minor, and trace concentrations in samples.

Gatan, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the required equipment as:
     (1) Gatan offers a product not otherwise available to the Government;
     (2) Gatan has permission to utilize proprietary information necessary to complete the        
           required work.   

The CL system must be installed on and integrated with the existing Quanta microscope.  Installation and integration of the CL system must not interfere with the operation of any of the other capabilities of the Quanta microscope. 

The existing Quanta and the intended CL system are commercial items.  FEI has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to the technology associated with the existing Quanta microscope.  Gatan has developed the technology and has proprietary rights to the technology associated with the CL system.  

Because of their business relationship with FEI, Gatan has permission to utilize FEI’s proprietary designs for the Quanta.  Gatan is the only known CL system manufacturer that can manufacture and deliver a CL system that can successfully be integrated and installed on the existing Quanta SEM.  

Notwithstanding the requirement to integrate with the FEI Quanta, no other vendor could be located who could supply a CL system competitive with the Gatan system.  Gatan has no US distributors; therefore, Gatan is the sole manufacturer and distributor of their equipment

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, responses received by September 4, 2009, will be considered by the Government.  

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC><p>RML Paging System<br />The Paging project, located at the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Rocky Mountain Laboratories (RML) in Hamilton, MT, consists of installation of a supervised paging system to serve approximately 27 buildings on the campus. The existing Notifier fire alarm system will serve as the backbone for the system, including fiber optic cable system between buildings and upgrade of existing Notifier fire alarm panels. For the majority of the buildings, interior wiring and speaker systems will be installed. In some new buildings, existing paging systems will be connected to the overall system. <br />The underground conduit pathways are largely in place to install the fiber cable. Existing cabling being abandoned will be removed. Interior works consists largely of installing devices with associated cutting and patching, terminating fiber and copper, providing power supplies, replacing fire alarm panels, low voltage work with speakers amplifiers and similar devices, pulling conductors, programming and testing.&nbsp; The magnitutde of this project is estimated between $500,000 and $1,000,000.&nbsp;</p>

The contractor is  responsible for ascertaining and complying with the procedures established by each installation on which it does business.  
5.  Installation Access Badges:  Each Marine Corps installation develops its own procedures for readily identifying contractor employees working on the installation.

In the exercise of this authority, the Commanding General may refuse to grant access or may bar Contractor employees, including employees who have previously been granted access.  Refusal to grant an employee access or barment of an employee does not relieve the Contractor of the responsibility to continue perfor-mance under this contract.

This solicitation is issued as a Request for Proposal (RFQ).   

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code 334515, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following specifications, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This solicitation is posted 100% Total Small Businesses and will be awarded as a Firm Fixed Price Purchase Order.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that the initial offer(s) is/are providing the Best Value and discussions are not necessary. 

The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) is in need of a contractor to design, develop and deliver two identical Transconductance Amplifier units for research purposes in order to study the electrophysiology of defibrillation waveform, duration, and shape; and evaluate these properties effect on efficacy of defibrillation success.

The Transconductance Amplifier will be used to amplify an arbitrary input control waveform to a high current waveform having the same shape and duration as the original voltage control waveform. The amplified arbitrary waveform will be used on excised animal hearts, and will therefore need to be of sufficient voltage and current for successful defibrillation. See Figure 1 below. The input control waveform (±5V) will be amplified by a factor of 1 Amp per Volt to produce the output waveform. 

The Contractor shall be required to:

a. Design, build and deliver two identical Transconductance Amplifiers with the following technical specifications: 
1. The gain of the Transconductance Amplifier shall be 1 Amp per Volt.
2. The Bipolar Output Terminals shall be isolated from ground with a safety disconnect implemented as an electromechanical relay or equivalent.
3. The maximum output voltage range, referenced to the negative Bipolar Output Terminal, shall be -190 Volts to +190 Volts.
4. The maximum output current shall vary with the load resistance:
a. For load resistances from 0 to 38 Ohms the maximum current output shall be limited to 5 Amps.
b. For load resistances greater than 38 Ohms the maximum current output shall be 190 Volts divided by the load resistance.




5. Within the specifications for maximum output current (Specification 4) the current output shall follow the voltage input with a tolerance of ± 2%.
6. Duration of output waveform at 5A: 500ms or more. 
7. Minimum number of 5A, square wave pulses, output per minute into a 38 Ohm load (by duration of pulse): 500 at 10ms, 50 at 100 ms, 10 at 500ms
8. The Bandwidth of the Transconductance Amplifier shall be DC to 1 kHz, or more. 
9. A BNC Analog Output for monitoring the voltage output of the Transconductance Amplifier. The monitor voltage shall be a linear representation of the voltage on the Bipolar Output Terminals: +5 Volts shall represent +190 Volts and -5 Volts shall represent -190 Volts. 
10. A BNC Analog Output for monitoring the current output of the Transconductance Amplifier. The monitor voltage shall be a linear representation of the voltage on the Bipolar Output Terminals: +5 Volts shall represent +5 Amps and -5 Volts shall represent -5 Amps.
11. A BNC Digital Input connection to enable the output of device. The Bipolar Output Terminals of the device shall be disconnected from the amplifier unless this enable line goes to a TTL logic low, engaging the electromechanical relays (see specification 2) and connecting the Bipolar Output Terminals to the amplifier. 
12. A BNC Analog Input connector for arbitrary control waveforms (±5V) to be amplified. The input impedance shall be &#8805; 5,000 Ohms.
13. Operation from AC power 110 volts, 50/60 Hz.
