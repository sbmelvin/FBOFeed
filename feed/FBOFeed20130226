<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is cited in FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i), "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements." The work performed by the laboratory requires minimum downtime to ensure the quality of results, response to outbreaks, and production of reagents. Further, due to the size, location, and necessary decontamination procedures for moving the equipment, it is neither feasible nor efficient for the equipment to be moved for service; therfore, on-site maintenance is required. Operating under NAICS 811219, Life Technologies is the only vendor that can guarantee 24-hour on-site response time with a manufacturer certified technician. The vendor guarnatees the use of original equipment manufacturer parts - even for parts no longer in production - software upgrades, and travel and labor costs, all at no additional expense on both equipment and the computer associated with it. Further, the vendor, as the original equipment manufacturer, guarantees that the equipment will perform at original specifications if serviced by a certified technician.</p>
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 5 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement, proposal or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Please forward the capability statement and/or pricing information to David Dombeck, Contracting Specialist, Reference 2013-54073, Centers for Disease Control, Procurement and Grants Office, ATTN: David Dombeck, MS: K14, 2920 Brandywine Road, Atlanta, GA 30341, or via email at vwj8@cdc.gov. All vendors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to an award of a federal contract. The website is: www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement. Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement for these services in the future.</p>
<p>If no affirmative responses are received within 5 days, negotiations will be conducted with the Life Technologies Corporation, as the only source and a contract will be issued without any additional notices being posted.</p>

<DESC>This is a notice, not a request for a proposal. A solicitation document will not be issued and proposals will not be requested.
<p>The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute on Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) intends to solicit, negotiate, and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis with Thermo Fisher Electron North America, LLC, 1400 Northpoint Parkway, Suite 50, West Palm Beach, Florida 33407-1976 to upgrade the Thermo Orbitap Velos mass spectrometer. NINDS anticipates that the high field orbitap mass analyzer in Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometers will afford incremental improvements in resolution, mass accuracy, and sensitivity as assessed by limit-of-detection determination based on enzymatic digests of protein standards. The fundamental importance is the significant increase in scan speed of the Orbitrap Elite, which will afford dramatic improvements in the dynamic range of sampling within a given sample, which NINDS anticipates will obviate the need for sample fractionation prior to mass analysis. The Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer in the lab is a critical component in carrying out the NINDS mission. With its high resolution and high mass accuracy, the Orbitrap Velos is a major workhorse for high-throughput protein identification, post-translational modification characterization, and quantitative proteomics using SILAC and iTRAQ. This mass spectrometer is utilized by DIR clinical investigators and trainees in pursuit of proteomics research projects.</p>
<p>Thermo Fisher Electron North America, LLC is the only vendor that can provide the upgrade of the Thermo Orbitap mass spectrometer. The Orbitrap Velos Elite is a highly sensitive and complex mass spectrometer, and requires expert maintenance and repair (when needed) by engineers who have received thorough, specialized training and have access to the patented and proprietary details of this scientific instrument. <br /><br />Therefore based on the aforementioned facts, only one responsible source and no other supplier or services will satisfy agency requirements FAR 6.302-1. The Government intends to select, evaluate and award the offer that represents the best value to the Government, price and all other factors considered. The acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition FAR 12 and is exempt from the requirement of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirement.</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities in response to this synopsis. The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Comments to this announcement, referencing synopsis number 2885276 may be submitted to the NIDA, SS/SA Branch 31 Center Drive, Room 1B59, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-2080; Attention: Jasmine Snoddy, Contract Specialist or email at Snoddyj@mail.nih.gov.</p>

An option to the base contract is to extend the new dike embankment an additional 3,300 feet to the east. It is estimated that as much as an additional 120,000 cubic yards of fill obtained from within the DMCA will be required to construct this option. A second option to the base contract is to extend the new dike embankment the remaining 6,350 feet toward the eastern end of the island. It is estimated that as much as an additional 105,000 cubic yards of material obtained from within the DMCA will be required for this option. Award of the second option will only occur if the first option is awarded.</p>

<DESC>Specifications

Objective  
The Surgical Care Line at Southern Arizona VA Health Care System (SAVAHCS) in Tucson, Arizona, requires medical instruments for performing catheter-based dilation of sinus ostia, also known as functional endoscopic dilation of the sinuses. Surgeons use these devices to dilate the sinus openings with the benefit of requiring little to no tissue removal inside the nose and sinuses. This minimally invasive procedure allows for treatment on an outpatient basis and may be used with other medical therapies or sinus surgery techniques, allowing for future treatment options if the condition progresses.

The Surgical Care Line requires the Balloon Sinusplasty by Acclarent or a functionally equal device. 

Requirements

"	The equipment is FDA-approved for catheter-based dilation of the sinus.

"	The technology uses small, soft, flexible devices that enter entirely through the nostrils. These devices are designed to gently open blocked sinus openings without tissue or bone removal. 

"	No tissue or bone is removed when using this technology, reducing bleeding associated with the procedure.

"	While conditions vary with each patient, procedures have a normal recovery time of 24 hours - 48 hours. 

"	This technology is an endoscopic tool and may be used with other medical therapies or sinus surgery techniques. It does not limit future treatment options if you have progressive disease.

"	The device should be indicated for access and dilatation of the maxillary, sphenoid, and frontal OSTIA, not just the recess.

"	The device should have an atraumatic light guide cable that can confirm the wire has transverse the true sinus ostia and also that the wire can provide a rail for the balloon to reach distal past a tortuous frontal outflow tract and ostium.


This is a brand name or equal to requirement. Please refer to clauses and provisions for instructions on how to bid on brand name or equal to requirements.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command- New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems is conducting a Market Survey to identify potential sources in private industry and academia that can offer advanced and/or novel test methods for characterizing energetic material performance. Specifically, the U.S. Government (USG) is seeking test methods that will assist with the performance characterization of the 120mm M1020 mortar ignition cartridge. The M1020 ignition cartridge is housed within the fin boom portion of the mortar cartridge. When dropped down a mortar tube the M1020 functions through initiation of a percussion primer via impact with the firing pin at the bottom of the tube. The output from the percussion primer initiates a black powder charge which in turn ignites a bed of granular gun propellant. The hot gases generated by the propellant flow through the flash holes in the fin boom to propel the mortar out of the tube and additionally to ignite propelling charges attached to the fin boom (if they are present). <br> The USG is seeking to quantify the functions, mechanisms of energy transfer, and performance of the M1020 ignition train through advanced and/or novel test methods for characterizing energetic material properties and output (specifically in relation to pyrotechnic percussion primer, black powder, and gun propellant performance) beyond that of traditional energetic testing (i.e. closed bomb testing, ballistic testing, etc.). Examples of desired responses to be quantified include but are not limited to characterizing/measuring: flame front, temperature of gases, temperature of hot particles, quantity of hot particles, rate of hot gases and particle generation, heat flux, flow rate, pressure, total energy, etc.  Proposed test methods can encompass multiple configurations; from energetic materials only to sub-assembly configurations to a full up energetic item.  <br>  <br> Companies/organizations should respond by providing the USG with the following information: <br>  <br> 1)  Name of company/organization. <br> 2)  Company/organization address and website address (if applicable). <br> 3)  Point of Contact name, telephone number, and e-mail address. <br> 4)  Company/organization size and classification based on applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and company Central Contractor Registration (CCR), if applicable.  <br> 5)  Summary of the company/organization's capabilities in regards to energetic testing to include a description of test procedures, instrumentation, and facilities/equipment.  <br> 6)  Current pricing for the company/organization's established energetic test capabilities and if a published pricing list is available.  <br>  <br> This is a Market Survey for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Market Survey or otherwise pay for information solicited. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary. Please indentify any proprietary information submitted. <br>  <br> Interested companies/organizations should provide the information requested above, within 30 days of this notice by electronic mail only to: Contract Specialist, Amy Kirzow, amy.e.kirzow.civ@mail.mil <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is seeking sources on behalf of the Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) Communications-Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) for passive, ground-based sensing systems that can provide long range detection and tracking of both unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and personnel targets.  The intent of this market research is to identify potential sensor capabilities for the development of stationary, mast-mounted, wide area Infrared Search and Track (IRST) systems. <br>   <br> The Government seeks information about the following: <br>  <br> Please provide the following information no later than 28 March 2013.  Future communications related to this program will be distributed based on the interested parties list. <br>  <br> 1.	Brief summary of the company. <br>  <br> 2.	Qualifications in designing and developing Infrared Search and Track systems or like efforts. <br>  <br> 3.	Has your Company performed this type of effort or a similar type effort (to include size and complexity) in the past, if so provide Contract Number, Point of Contact (POC), e-mail address, phone number, and a brief description of your direct support of the effort?  <br>  <br> 4.	In the event your company was awarded a contract as a result of a subsequent solicitation, would you plan to prime?  Describe how you will either produce or subcontract for each component or assembly required for the Infrared Search and Track system.  Please identify sources of supply for any components or assemblies for which you intend to subcontract production. Describe how you will update/configure or subcontract for the update/configuration.  <br>  <br> 5.	Describe the schedule requirements to establish production capacity and to qualify the prime or suppliers that may provide parts for this Configuration Updates. <br>  <br> 6.	A long range, ground-based, wide area coverage Electro-Optic Infrared (EOIR) sensor system for detection and tracking of multiple UAS and personnel targets. <br>  <br> 7.	Algorithms for EOIR sensors that can perform automated, real-time detection and tracking of multiple UAS and personnel targets simultaneously within the field of regard over extended periods of time.   <br>  <br> 8.	The ability to hand off target tracks between separate EOIR sensor systems such that the history of the target track is maintained and can continue to be updated with new track information (for instance, in the case where a target track starts within the field of regard of one system but then moves to an area where a second system has a better perspective or line-of-sight to target). <br>  <br> 9.	A long range, ground-based, high resolution EOIR sensor system that can be automatically cued by the detection and tracking system for man-in-the-loop confirmation of detected targets (the high resolution and wide area coverage sensor capability may be combined in a single sensor via optics or other means). <br>  <br> 10.	 Image processing algorithms that provide an enhanced capability for real-time detection, tracking, classification and/or recognition of targets, whether automatic or man-in-the-loop (i.e., local area contrast enhancement, electronic stabilization, false alarm rejection).   <br>  <br> 11.	 In the event your company was awarded a contract as a result of a subsequent solicitation, could you acquire enough space to perform this task prior to contract award or within 15 calendar days after contract award?  <br>  <br> The Government is interested in integrated, passive, system-level approaches that can address all five capabilities (6 through 10) above and could be ready for a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5/6 demonstration in Fiscal Year 2015.  System approaches of particular interest to the Government have the potential to address the following notional system-level requirements: <br>  <br> - UAS Targets - Group 1 through 3*   <br>  <br>           o	  Automated detection and tracking of multiple UAS targets flying tactical mission profiles at ranges of up to several kilometers against varying backgrounds (sky, clouds, mountains, etc.) over extended periods of time. <br>         o  Man-in-the loop classification of UAS targets at tactical ranges of up to several kilometers. <br>  <br>     *Definition of UAS groups can be found in Command and Control for Joint Air Operations, Joint Publication 3-30 (Washington, DC: U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, 12 January 2010), Chapter III Section B-9. <br>  <br> - Personnel Targets <br>  <br>     o	Automated detection and tracking of multiple moving personnel targets at tactical ranges of up to several kilometers against varying backgrounds, terrain, and in natural and cultural clutter environments over extended periods of time. <br>     o	Man-in-the loop recognition of personnel targets at tactical ranges of up to several kilometers. <br>  <br>  <br> - System Parameters <br>  <br>     o	Day and night sensor operation. <br>     o	System will be mounted on a ground-based mast platform with a maximum height of 6 meters. <br>     o	360  azimuth coverage. System approaches that address this by scanning sensors over the coverage area are acceptable provided they are used with a compatible track-while-scan algorithm. System approaches that address this via fixed position, staring sensors are also acceptable. <br>     o	Minimum of 55  elevation coverage (nominally -5  to + 50  off of the horizon). System approaches that address elevation coverage over multiple azimuth scans are acceptable provided they are used with a compatible track while scan algorithm.   <br>     o	Maximum sensor size of 20 quote mark  x 20 quote mark  x 48 quote mark  (not including mast). <br>     o	Maximum sensor weight of 200 pounds (not including mast). <br>     o	Maximum sensor power draw of 300 Watts (not including mast).  Processing of the sensor output does not necessarily need to be located on the mast and therefore does not need to be included under this power draw. <br>  <br> Detection and tracking of other relevant military targets, such as ground vehicles, are also of interest to the Government under this RFI but are not a primary focus.  RFI responses can assume a Government furnished mast and should focus discussions on the system payload for the mast.  RFI responses should clearly state any assumptions that are made regarding mast specifications (such as mast stability) when describing potential system approaches or performance. <br>  <br> Sources possessing potential solutions are invited to submit a White Paper not to exceed 15 pages in length describing their capabilities and system concepts.  The White Paper must include, at a minimum, comprehensive descriptions supported by facts and rigorous scientific reasoning, that address the following considerations for all technologies proposed: a detailed discussion of potential sensor or software solutions for each of the five capabilities listed above, potential integrated system approaches, an estimation of system performance against both UAS and personnel targets (including range performance for all sensors, algorithm performance including false alarms, and tracked target revisit rates for scanned sensors), a discussion of relevant experience with technologies for similar applications (specifically against UAS targets), current technology maturity, and cost. <br>  <br>   Responses should also include a cover letter (not included in the page count) providing: <br>  <br> 1.	 Please provide the following Point of Contact information: <br>  <br> Company: <br> Address: <br> Point of Contact: <br> Phone Number: <br> Fax Numbers: <br> Email Address <br> Cage Code and Duns Number If your company holds a GSA Schedule contract (874 or other), please provide the Schedule number. <br>  <br> Please identify your company's small business size standard based on the primary North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 541712 Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  The Small Business Size Standard for this NAICS code is 500 number of employees. For more information, refer to http://www.sba.gov/size . <br>  <br>  Please also indicate any socioeconomic classifications: <br>  <br> Large Business Concern <br> Small Business (SB) Concern <br> 8A <br> Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) <br> Women-Owned Small Business <br> Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) <br> Veteran-Owned Small Business <br> Service-Disable Veteran-Owned Small Business <br>  <br> THE FOLLOWING ONLY APPLIES TO SMALL BUSINESS RESPONDENTS: <br>  <br> 1.  In the event your company was awarded a contract as a result of a subsequent solicitation and you would plan to prime, please inform how you will meet the limitations on subcontracting clause 52.219-14. <br>  <br> 2.  The Government understands that teaming is an intricate part of contracting.  In the event your company was awarded a contract as a result of a subsequent solicitation, please briefly describe how you would approach selecting team members for this requirement if you are not performing this action 100% in house. <br>  <br> 3.  In the event your company was awarded a contract as a result of a subsequent solicitation, can your company sustain itself if not paid for 90 calendar days? <br>  <br> This information will help the Government form its acquisition strategy. <br>  <br> This Request for Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only.  It is not a request for proposal and does not constitute any obligation by the Government to award a contract based on the findings of this RFI.

<DESC><strong>Introduction.</strong> This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice. The NACIS code for this acquisition is 541720 with a size standard of 500.<br /><br /><strong>Background</strong>. Child maltreatment (CM) is a significant public health problem affecting physical and emotional health throughout the lifespan. Children who experience intensive and prolonged stress (such as CM) especially in early life, are at increased risk for disrupted early brain development, compromised functioning of the nervous and immune systems as well as health problems in later life including mental health problems, risky health behavior, chronic diseases, subsequent violence perpetration or victimization during adolescence or adulthood, and early death.<br /><br />Given the significant magnitude and health burden of CM, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) designated the prevention of violence against children and youth as a focus area. Additionally, CDC/NCIPC Division of Violence Prevention (DVP) has identified safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for children (SSNRs) as a strategic direction for CM prevention.<br /><br />Safety, stability, and nurturing are three essential qualities of children's relationships with caregivers and for a broader environment that supports positive child development. <br /><br />Although the CM prevention field consists of hundreds of prevention interventions, few are evidence based, and the majority focus on changing individual behavior rather than the broader context in which CM occurs. Individual or family approaches do not take into account that CM and safe, stable, nurturing relationships emerge from, and are sustained within, social contexts. These circumstances are shaped by a wider set of forces: economics, social policies, and politics. Thus, there is reason to believe that community and societal-level prevention strategies (e.g., policies, changing broad social norms, and increasing support for evidence-based interventions) may increase safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments and decrease CM. <br /><br />CDC developed guidance for what communities and society can do to prevent CM and advance SSNRs: Essentials for Childhood: Steps to Create Safe, Stable, and Nurturing Relationships. This guidance document can be accessed at http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/essentials/.<br /><br /><strong>Purpose and Objectives.</strong> CDC will fund state health departments to implement the Essentials for Childhood (EfC) guidance by utilizing a collective impact framework to develop and support sustainable, multi-sectorial efforts that promote safe, stable nurturing relationships and environments. Efforts must incorporate all four goal areas in Essentials for Childhood: Steps to Create Safe, Stable, Nurturing Relationships. <br /><br />The project will provide training, technical assistance and evaluation activities to assist CDC-funded grantees (state health departments and their child maltreatment prevention partners) to engage a collective impact approach to facilitate full implementation of the EfC guidance. The project will track and monitor key collective impact processes, principles and procedures for programmatic activities within funded states and across the EfC project; will provide opportunities for shared learning among grantees as well as other stakeholders nationally; and will become the foundation to inform future implementation and dissemination guidance for broad adoption of the four EfC goals to support safe, stable, nurturing relationships and environments for children.<br /><br /><strong>Project Requirements</strong>. The potential requirement will include the following tasks:<br />Base Year - Preparation and Project Activities: <br /><br />a. Develop a work plan to include training and technical assistance activities, and shared learning and program improvement activities for CDC, EfC grantees and child maltreatment prevention partners for the Implementation of Essentials for Childhood using a collective impact approach and addressing all EfC goal areas;<br />b. Conduct training and provide technical assistance to support the work plan's activities;<br />c. Working with CDC staff, create a process to track and monitor key processes, principles and procedures for programmatic activities within and across funded states in order to provide opportunities for shared learning among grantees as well as other stakeholders nationally; <br />d. Using the information, lessons learned and processes collected, share information with CDC and EfC grantees and stakeholders to develop a foundation to inform future implementation and dissemination guidance for broad adoption of EfC goals to support SSNRs for children;<br />e. Review and analyze grantees' collective impact infrastructure, baseline environmental scan, state profile, strategic planning process, action plan and baseline community norms assessment results to identify needs for further training and technical assistance;<br />f. Attend reverse site visit which includes on-site training, technical assistance and participation in evaluation activities for EfC grantees and select partners; and <br />g. Provide monthly telephonic updates and a written annual report to the CDC.<br /><br />Option Years 1 through 4 - Annual Activities:<br />a. Reassess and adjust the work plan using feedback and information collected from the previous year in order to support the project objectives;<br />b.

<SOLNBR>CMS-2013-CROWN-CDDS
<RESPDATE>031313

<DESC>Description:<br />Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web-Enabled Network (CROWN) <br />CROWN Data Discrepancy Support (CDDS)<br />Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
<p>Introduction:<br />This is a Sources Sought notice to determine the availability of HUBZone businesses that can provide data discrepancy support to providers of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) services to resolve discrepancies involving administrative, patient, and clinical measures data electronically submitted via a web-based application (known as CROWNWeb) by ESRD providers/facilities.</p>
<p>Background: <br />The Social Security Act of 1972 (P.L. 92-603) extended Medicare Coverage to all patients with ESRD who require dialysis or kidney transplantation in order to survive, regardless of their age. The Conditions for Coverage (CFC) for suppliers of ESRD services, updated and published in April 2008, mandate that all Dialysis Facilities submit administrative and clinical data electronically.</p>
<p>In June 2012, CMS released the ESRD Consolidated Renal Operations in a Web Enabled Network (CROWNWeb) nationally. CROWNWeb is a secure, web-based system that captures clinical and administrative data from Medicare-certified dialysis facilities across the United States and its territories. The CROWNWeb system provides a single, central database, used by all ESRD Facilities, ESRD Networks, and CMS as a repository for 100% of clinical data to support various program goals such as National Quality Improvement projects, Public Reporting, and Value Based Purchasing. CROWNWeb data will be important to the calculation of facility-specific scores and percentage payment reductions to implement the ESRD Quality Incentive Program (QIP) established under &sect;153(c) of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA) of 2008.</p>
<p>The ESRD Quality Incentive Program (QIP) is the first Value Based Purchasing (VBP) program where providers will be paid based on the quality of care they provide to Medicare beneficiaries. The ESRD QIP will use clinical performance measures data submitted electronically to CMS via CROWNWeb to support the mandate for payment reductions to providers of services and dialysis facilities, when scores for performance standards do not meet or exceed the QIP standards.</p>
<p>With national implementation of CROWNWeb, the number of Dialysis Facilities that submit data to CMS electronically will continue to increase. The CDDS Contractor will support the ESRD user community which submits data electronically to CMS CROWNWeb. Specifically, the CDDS Contractor will work with the ESRD QualityNet Help Desk by performing case work to resolve and close Tier 3 Help Desk Tickets that require specialized expertise to correct discrepancies with both ESRD facility and Network CROWNWeb data submissions.</p>
<p>Purpose:<br />The attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW) outlines the tasks to be conducted to provide specialized expertise to address data quality issues, resolve QualityNet Help Desk tickets, and improve the integrity of CROWNWeb data submission from ESRD facilities and CROWNWeb users.</p>
<p>The Draft SOW includes the following task objectives for Contractor performance:</p>
<p>&bull; Deliver operational support for resolution of escalated tickets related to discrepancies in clinical and administrative data submitted electronically by ESRD facilities and other CROWNWeb users and establish target service level agreements for resolution/response time<br />&bull; Create, update and maintain technical user support documentation related to incident prevention, error types and resolution methods to assist ESRD facilities and continuously improve accuracy and efficiency in electronic data submission<br />&bull; Administrative, project management, communications support and procurement of equipment for carrying out the services at the contractor's facility<br />&bull; Perform data quality functions for all ESRD Systems (REMIS/SSA-EDB/UNOS)<br />&bull; Provide Data Quality Reports</p>
<p>Description of the Work: <br />A sample of the scope of services that may be required of the Data Discrepancy Support provider is highlighted in the attached Draft SOW.</p>
<p>Contractor Requirements:<br />The contractor shall have appropriate staff or an appropriate team (with teaming partners) to respond to User Help Desk tickets and fulfill the work responsibilities contained in the Draft Statement of Work, including, but not limited to:</p>
<p>1. Staff with a working knowledge and specialized understanding of the ESRD clinical issues, CMS' ESRD Program, including the ESRD Networks and Dialysis Facilities, and the expertise and experience in analyzing CMS administrative data and other ESRD clinical data.<br />2. Staff with a working knowledge and understanding of nephrology and ability to research and resolve errors and discrepancies involving data from multiple sources and forms relating to patient and facility events/treatments.<br />3. Staff with understanding of database programming, validation rules, and logic checks to identify, analyze and provide options to prevent recurring errors in electronic data submissions. Contractor's staff must also have the ability to generate dynamic ad-hoc reports to be provided to CMS upon request, as it pertains to the results of the data validation.</p>
<p>Contractor Submission:<br />Please provide your experience, knowledge and capability to provide the services listed in the Draft SOW, including the following:</p>
<p>1. Discuss your background and knowledge of ESRD clinical issues, CMS ESRD Program, and expertise and experience in analyzing CMS ESRD administrative and clinical data.<br />2.

<p>Interested parties having the capabilities necessary to perform the stated requirements may submit capability statements via e-mail to Jeannine Bohlen at Jeannine.Bohlen@cms.hhs.gov. Capability statements must demonstrate the minimum requirements outlined above. Please address each in order listed above.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall also include the following information: corporate structure (corporation, LLC, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability corporation, professional corporation, etc.); and tax identification number. Capability statements shall be limited to 15 pages and shall include any/all teaming arrangements.</p>
<p>Please include the following:<br />1. Business Information<br />a. DUNS number<br />b. Company name<br />c. Company address<br />d. Current GSA schedule appropriate to this Sources Sought<br />e.

<p>Most of these deliveries are to remote locations. USDA is currently gathering requirements to include quantities, locations and frequency to get a better idea on what the needs for fresh shell eggs will be. When responding to this RFI, please consider the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Is your firm able to deliver shell eggs on the same truck as produce items? <br />2. Are there any limitations on frequency of deliveries and quantities for fresh shell eggs?<br />3. Does soliciting for fresh shell eggs as well as produce items limit your ability to offer?<br />4. If you are already delivering to these remote areas, will adding fresh shell eggs to the contract have an effect on your proposed pricing? If affirmative, please provide an estimate of any cost decreases or increases that may result (a simple percentage basis).<br />5. What are the financial risks, if any, in committing to a long term contract that included fresh shell eggs?</p>
<p>We encourage your participation; please share your ideas on the feasibility of supply fresh shell eggs. Your written comments, suggestions and ideas regarding this proposal will be treated as confidential and for Government use only. Please provide your responses via mail or email, by March 12, 2013 at 3:00 p.m. EDT to the following address:</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice to determine the availability and capability of Small Business Manufacturers or Small Businesses capable of supplying a U.S. made product of a small business manufacturer or producer. This notice is for planning purposes only, and does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals or Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained herein. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing and the size standard is 500 employees. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is seeking to identify sources that can provide single-cell auto prep system with the minimum system requirements listed below.
<p>Background</p>
<p>The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research is attempting to define Quality Attributes for cellular products by analyzing mRNA transcripts in single cells. The Laboratory's current procedure requires isolation of single cells by way of a conventional flow cytometer, and initiating reverse transcription and specific target amplification in separate manual steps. This process does not allow the evaluation of the morphology of the isolated single cells. In addition, individual cell viability cannot be assessed nor can the size of the cell be measured. The objective is both to automate this process and to allow for measuring the size of each cell before lysis, allowing at the end for transfer of mRNA prepared from separate cells and subjected to Specific Target Amplification to be loaded directly onto microfluidic chips for single cell qPCR.</p>
<p>Minimum System Requirements:</p>
<p>. The system shall perform automated isolation and capture of single cells, followed by their lysis, isolation of mRNA, reverse transcription and specific target amplification in a format directly compatible with the laboratory's existing Biomark microfluidic analyzer.</p>
<p>. The system shall isolate at least 96 single cells when charged with 1000 cells and allow for staining, lysis, reverse transcription, and specific target preamplification of the mRNA in each of the cells separately.</p>
<p>. The system shall conduct simultaneous expression profiling of multiple genes on multiple single cells.</p>
<p>. Post-Warranty System Annual Preventive and Corrective Maintenance Requirements for up to four (4) option years to include:</p>
<p>. Minimum of one on-site preventive maintenance per year<br />. Unlimited corrective repairs to include all parts, labor and travel with maximum of 72 hour onsite response<br />. Unlimited Software and Firmware updates<br />. Unlimited phone and email Technical Support with response time within 24 hours of request for support<br />. Preventive and Corrective Maintenance performed by OEM-certified technicians, following OEM specifications, manuals, and service bulletins, using OEM-certified tools and replacement parts, components, subassemblies, etc.</p>
<p>Parties submitting capability statements shall be advised that generic capability statements are not sufficient for effective evaluation of respondents' capacity and capability of providing the required equipment. Respondents should limit their capability statements to no more than ten (10) pages in length, excluding standard brochures, technical specifications, descriptive literature and any other information that demonstrates the capabilities of the contractor to meet the Government's requirement. Provide two contact names, email and phone numbers for users of the proposed product that may be contacted by the Government. Potential contractors must indicate business size, proof of any set-aside certification and company's DUNS number and provide a contact name, the mailing address, phone number, email address of point of contact and reference AUTOPREP 1114978. Identification of the firm's GSA Schedule contract(s) Schedule number and contract number that may be applicable to this potential requirement are also requested.</p>
<p>Interested parties must respond with capability statements in person on or before March 7, 2013 by 1:00 PM (Central Time) Jefferson, Arkansas, at the Food and Drug Administration, Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services, Field Operations Branch, Attn: Marcia Park, 3900 NCTR Road, HFT-322, Jefferson, AR 72079-9502; Faxed to 870/543-7990 or emailed to Marcia.park@fda.hhs.gov.</p>

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a superconducting gravimeter.<br /><br />The required superconducting gravimeter is precise enough to measure relative gravity changes at a part in 10 to the tenth/minute and with a relative stability of better than a part in 10 to the ninth/month to provide the future dissemination of mass via a watt balance. The gravimeter will be required to operate continuously for months with little to no maintenance.
<p><br />The gravimeter will be used as part of the NIST Electronic Kilogram project, which provides a link between macroscopic mass and quantum electrical standards through a watt balance that equates electrical and mechanical power to levels of parts in 10 to the eighth. After the redefinition of the International System of Units, the new NIST4 watt balance will provide a direct realization of mass. To realize mass with a watt balance at parts in 10 to the eighth requires the value of gravity to be determined with an uncertainty at parts in 10 to the ninth. To achieve this level of uncertainty for continuous, day-to-day realization of mass with a watt balance requires the simultaneous operation of a robust, relatively maintenance-free gravimeter with the precision to measure relative gravity changes at a part in 10 to the tenth/minute and with a relative stability of better than a part in 10 to the ninth/month. A backup cryocooler system, installation, and training are also required.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the superconducting gravimeter, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a purchase order. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that results would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>

<DESC>The Advanced Photonic Technologies Branch (Code 55360) of the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, Pacific (SSC-PAC) is currently studying an Advanced High-Data-Rate (AdvHDR) Satellite Communication (SATCOM) system for submarines.  This system is currently in the development and proof- of-concept phase with the goal of transitioning to the prototype stage in the coming years.  SSC-PAC is teamed with Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Newport, RI on the AdvHDR program, where SSC-PAC is responsible for the development of a RF-over-fiber subsystem that will be used to transfer SATCOM signals from a phased array antenna located in the mast to a the SATCOM terminal located inboard.  SSC-PAC Technical Report 1991 (January 2010) describes laboratory testing of a multi-channel RF-over-fiber WDM link for AdvHDR that was subsequently used in successful over- the-air SATCOM testing.  The RF-over- fiber transmitters and receivers described in this report were assembled from COTS lasers, modulators, detectors, and RF amplifiers.  In more recent work, all RF photonic links described in this report (except the Q-band link) have been replaced with COTS packaged transmitters and receivers.  This system is currently undergoing over- the-air SATCOM testing.  The next step planned in this development is to reduce size required by the transmitters, receivers and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) components by integrating all outboard transmitters and receivers into a single unit and all inboard transmitters and receivers into a single unit.   Reducing the size requirement for the mast mounted system is of particular interest.  This compact, multi-channel WDM, RF-over-fiber signal distribution subsystem is the subject of this RFI.  The purposes of this RFI is to conduct market research to gain knowledge and help the Government identify potential sources that are interested in responding to a future solicitation of a multi-channel RF-over-fiber link. Potential responders should provide information regarding capability of meeting the Governments requirements, estimated anticipated cost, and lead time of such a link. Potential responders should provide information describing estimated approximate size, and power requirements of the mast mounted unit and the inboard unit.  Estimate of the size and power of the mast mounted unit is of particular interest.   See Attachment for RFI Requirements

The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use,
disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

8.1.2 SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in an unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to the VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident.

<DESC>This Request for Information (RFI) is for informational purposes only.  It is not a request for proposal and does not constitute any obligation by the Government to award a contract based on the findings of this RFI.  The Government will not reimburse interested sources or respondents to notice, for any costs incurred in association with this announcement or for subsequent exchanges of information.   <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG) Belvoir Division is seeking sources on behalf of the RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD) for a hostile fire detection system.  The intent of this market research is to identify potential sensor capabilities and system solutions for the development of a Hostile Fire Detection (HFD) system suitable for vehicles and fixed sites. <br>   <br> The Government seeks information about HFD systems capable of detecting a hostile-fire event, and determining the location of the event in an operationally useful timeframe.   <br>  <br> This RFI addresses standalone HFD systems without integration into an active protection system.  However, HFD systems that provide additional situational awareness capabilities (such as an imaging system) are of interest, as are HFD capabilities that can be incorporated into existing systems.  Sensors of all modes (such as acoustic, EOIR, or radar) are of interest, as are systems comprised of more than one sensor mode. <br>  <br> The primary threats of interest for this RFI are small arms (.50 caliber and smaller), rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs).  Secondary threats include medium caliber arms (20 - 40mm) and recoilless rifles.  The HFD system must be able to detect and locate shot events at ranges up to the maximum effective range and beyond of these weapons.  Classification of the threat type as small arms, RPGs, or ATGMs is desired.   <br>  <br> The Government seeks information on a single technical approach suitable for both wheeled and tracked vehicles.  At a minimum, the HFD system on a stationary platform should be able to display the azimuth and elevation to the location of the hostile fire event within seconds of the event.  It is highly desired that the system should have this capability for moving platforms and that the range to target, or geo-location (such as latitude and longitude), of the hostile-fire event be provided by the system.  In addition, the Government is interested in systems that can also be integrated with existing surveillance systems at fixed sites. <br>  <br> A low false alarm rate is important to the overall effectiveness of the HFD system.  Technical approaches to minimizing the false alarm rate, as well as any supporting analyses or data to quantitatively verify false alarm performance, should be provided. <br>  <br> The Government is interested in integrated, system-level approaches that could be ready for a minimum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5/6 demonstration in Fiscal Year 2015.  An explanation of component and system maturity is required; if TRL levels are used, provide brief reasoning for choosing the listed level. <br>  <br> Sources possessing potential solutions are invited to submit a White Paper not to exceed 15 pages in length describing their capabilities and system concepts.  The White Paper must include, at a minimum, comprehensive descriptions supported by facts and rigorous scientific reasoning, that address the following considerations for all technologies proposed: a detailed discussion of potential sensor or software solutions, potential integrated system approaches, an estimation of system performance against both small arms and RPG / ATGM  (including range performance for all sensors and algorithm performance including false alarms), a discussion of relevant experience with technologies for similar applications, current technology maturity, and cost. <br>  <br> White Papers shall also include: <br>  <br> 1.  Point (s) of contact (email and phone numbers) for further Government inquiry should more information be desired, name and address of firm, Central Contractor Registration CAGE Code and current level of firm's facility clearance (Secret, Top Secret or No Clearance). <br>  <br> 2. Statement as to whether or not your company is considered a small or large business. Please also indicate any socioeconomic classification (8(a) Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB) Woman-Owned Small Business Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Veteran-Owned Small Business <br> Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business) that applies. The small business size standard is 500 employees for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541712.   Additionally, responders should include  information if the company has performed this type of effort or similar type effort (to include size and complexity) before, if so provide Contract Number, Point of Contact (POC), e-mail address, phone number, and a brief description of your direct support of the effort? <br> This information will help the Government form its acquisition strategy. <br>  <br> Proprietary information submitted in response to this Sources Sought shall be marked accordingly and will be protected when clearly identified as proprietary.   <br>  <br> The ideas presented in the white paper will be discussed and assessed by U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate (NVESD).  Government support contractors will be involved in the review and assessment of responses submitted under this RFI. <br>  <br> Response to this RFI should be received no later than 30 calendar days from the date of this notice.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD SOLE SOURCE <br>  <br> THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. This is a notice of intent to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541512,  quote mark Computer System Design Services quote mark , with a size standard of $25.5 Million. <br>  <br> The Mission and Instillation Contracting Command Fort Jackson intends to make a sole source award to Accenture Federal Services LLC, 800 North Glebe Road, Suite 300, Arlington, VA 22203-1807 for the purchase and implementation of Accenture's Task Management Tool (TMT) for the Third United States Army Central Command (ARCENT), 1951, 1 Gabreski Dr. building 1947 Shaw AFB, SC 29125. <br>  <br> The proposed contract action is for supplies/services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c) (1) and FAR 6.302.   <br>  <br> The justification for the sole source requirements as follows: <br>  <br> USARCENT requires a fully functioning, customizable and scalable task management capability to assign, track, and manage no less than 10 different business processes (i.e. evaluations, awards, congressional, freedom of information act (FOIAs), financial liability investigations of property loss (FLIPLs), internal and external taskers).  The task management solution must provide executive and managerial level decision dashboards.  The task management capability shall utilize Microsoft Dynamics Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and leverage Microsoft SharePoint file repository and collaboration environment.  This capability must interface with Microsoft Outlook Global Address List (GAL) and Active Directory for user authentication using the Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the Common Access Card (CAC).  The integrated capability must also interface and seamlessly share information with our higher and adjacent commands' systems-the Accenture developed Task Management Tool that utilizes Microsoft's Dynamic CRM server.  It must enable non-licensed users' access and ability to work on a temporary collaboration site with permissions to edit/upload documents and add notes accordingly.  The integrated capability must have an Army Certificate of Networthiness from the US Army Network Command (NETCOM) or an Authority to Operate (ATO) on the Department of Defense network.  It must comply with the appropriate DOD-approved architectures, programs, standards and guidelines, such as Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Information Guide (STIG), DISA Common Operating Environment (COE), Defense Information Systems Network (DISN), and Shared Data Environment (SHADE). <br>  <br> The contractor provided services will integrate Microsoft Dynamics CRM software and TMT configurations into the USARCENT server; provide 600 TMT licenses with the option to purchase an additional 600 licenses upon the receipt of additional funding; provide end user and system administrator training; and provide configuration/enhancement services for TMT software in order to meet the specific needs of USARCENT staff.  The contractor is responsible for integrating the TMT program into the workflow/staff throughout USARCENT at Continental United States (CONUS) and Outside Continental United States (OCONUS) locations in order to enable a more streamlined/automated tasking procedure through the provision of increased transparency, visibility and accountability within the Microsoft CRM footprint.   <br>  <br> The TMT solution will leverage the inherent capabilities resident in Microsoft CRM itself, capitalize on CRM's existing Authority to Operate (ATO), and ensure seamless compatibility with supporting programs such as Microsoft Office and Microsoft SharePoint.  The solution shall be deployed on servers employing Microsoft Server 2008R2.  It shall also reside in Microsoft SharePoint environment in order to leverage its repository functionalities on both Nonsecured Internet Protocol Routable Network (NIPRNET) and the Secure Internet Protocol Routable Network (SIPRNET).  Application must be robust enough to allow tasking workflows to exist with unlimited users operating within one task.  <br>  <br> Creation of subtasks with separate suspense dates within the context of the original task must be allowable.  Application must include the ability to set and adjust due dates as required.  Application must have collaboration capability within the task management software environment, and notifications of new tasks to users must transmit to user inboxes in Microsoft Outlook. Suspense dates of accepted tasks must populate on user Outlook Calendars.   <br>  <br> Attachment of pdf, all Microsoft Office files and xfdl (to include xfdl variants) must be possible within the task tracking software environment.  The application must have managerial interface (dashboard) separate from that of Action Officers that allows task searches, tracking, and organization, with the ability to drill down into current working and completed tasks, in order to monitor work at the action officer and collaborate directly with actions officers if required.  <br>  <br> The managerial interface must leverage CRM capability to provide metrics on task completion, workload, and work distribution. Additionally, users must have the ability to leverage privacy and security settings to tasks containing sensitive information.  The tasking solution software must have a search capability that leverages CRM's inherent search ability, that is capable of executing search inquiries by task, user, keyword, document, and other fields relevant to any given task instance. <br>    <br> Tasking solution must possess the capability to incorporate non-licensed users in the tasking solution environment in order for non-licensed users to respond (within the tasking solution environment) to taskers assigned by tasking solution licensed users.  Tasking solution should seamlessly leverage the GAL for the purposes of assigning tasks and conducting user and organizational searches.  Tasking solution must possess the capability to customize the user interface with drop down menus, entry fields, and selection tabs in order to ensure an intuitive user experience for action officers and managerial users. Task lists, collaborative discussion, and reporting metrics must be exportable to MS Excel, MS Word, and MS PowerPoint. <br>    <br> The capability shall protect PII either through User or Role based access; or demonstrate the ability to mark and segregate or quarantine tasks and attachments as private or close-hold.  The capability shall be required to leverage DoD's PKI and CAC capabilities on both the NIPRNET and SIPRNET in accordance with applicable DISA standards and regulations.  The capability shall incorporate digital signature functionality, either inherently or through the ApproveIt Desktop or other Army approved application for document formats including and not limited to .docx, .pdf, and .xfdl standards.   <br>  <br> Future software versions shall ensure emerging industry, DoD and Army acceptable standards are also incorporated and fully functional in subsequent releases.  The capability shall enable users to customize and configure personal dashboards based on the user's business requirements.    <br>  <br> The capability shall also enable metric reporting not limited to open, closed, historical tasks, trends and subordinates' past and current case assignments and workloads.  The capability shall enable licensed users to manage, assign and delegate tasks to licensed and non-licensed subordinate users.   <br>  <br> The Contractor shall ensure that the capability is globally accessible to all USARCENT users. <br>  <br> The major objectives to be supported by TMT are as follows: <br>  <br> a.	Automate the dissemination and reporting of no less than 10 different business processes to include congressional, freedom of information act (FOIAs), financial liability investigations of property loss (FLIPLs), and internal and external taskers. <br>  <br> b.	Automate the staffing of awards, decorations and evaluations. <br>  <br> c.	Auto population of task information without manual input. <br>  <br> d.	The ability to seamlessly interface with USARCENT's higher and adjacent commands' Accenture TMT system. <br>  <br> e.	Real-time metrics. <br>  <br> f.	Task tracking from creation to completion.  End to end audit trail and visibility.  Central repository for response documents and comments with no need to search email chains or Outlook folders. <br>  <br> g.	Enable the significant increase in the level of transparency and accountability of staff processes, providing USARCENT leadership with valuable organizational data including workflow bottleneck and workload comparisons, and improved efficiency of the tasker and reporting process.  <br>  <br> h.	The ability to leverage Microsoft Share Point file repository and collaboration environment. <br>  <br> i.	Executive and managerial level dashboards. <br>  <br> j.	Ability to interface with Microsoft Outlook Global Address List (GAL) and Active Directory for user authentication of using Department of Defense (DoD) Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Common Access Card (CAC). <br>  <br> Avanade Federal Services (Avanade) was the sole developer of TMT.  Avanade is now 80% owned by and is a subsidiary of Accenture.  Accordingly, TMT is now only available through Accenture who has the exclusive right to sell the Avanade licenses as a part of the transition agreement with Avanade.  TMT and the underlying source code are still owned by Avanade but the TMT application is considered proprietary to both Accenture and Avanade.   Moreover, Accenture is the sole seller of TMT and does not have authorized resellers. The Government is not able to procure licenses or support of the TMT application from any source other than Accenture.   <br>  <br> Research has shown that there are various other task management applications that are available both commercially and non-commercially, that can efficiently and effectively track tasks; some are built completely web based, some cloud based, some can operate on intuit quick base, some operate on Microsoft with various add-in and work arounds, etc. however, none of them possess the capability to seamlessly interoperate with Accenture's TMT products that are currently being utilized by over 75,000 DoD users, more importantly, USARCENT's higher and adjacent commands.  The ability to interface and exchange data with other commands is one of the most important aspects of USARCENT's requirement.  Without the ability to send, receive, transfer, track, and report tasks amongst USARCENT and other commands, USARCENT's needs will not have been met and an additional solution will be required to be procured which will result in additional funding being spent. <br>  <br> The speed, accuracy, and availability of data directly correlate to accountability and our military and civilian leaders' ability to make informed decisions which affects the mission.  While there are other contractors who can provide a task management solution that can meet part of USARCENT's needs, no contractor, other than Accenture can provide a solution that can totally meet the customer's minimum needs. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> This is not a request for Competitive Proposals. No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.   <br>  <br> Response to this notice must be received via email by 4 March 2013, no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time. Requests should be marked with TMT W9124C-13-R-0010. <br>  <br> Address questions to Charles Taylor at charles.e.taylor46.civ@mail.mil.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source 
<SOLNBR>N6264513ADV14
<ARCHDATE>03132013
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award a sole source contract under the authority of 6.302-1 to Magnum Medical Overseas JV LLC, 929 County Road 687, Angleton, TX 77515, for the continuation of Educational and Developmental Intervention Services (EDIS) in support of the Special Programs Division at the Department of the Navy, Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED). 

The purpose of this contract is to provide early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities (birth through 2 years, inclusive) and their families, and special education and related services to children with disabilities (ages 3 through 21 years, inclusive) entitled to receive special services from the Department of Defense; provision of a Free, Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) including special education and related services for children with disabilities enrolled in the Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS), as specified in their Individualized Educational Programs (IEP); and monitoring of DoD programs providing EIS, special education, and related services for compliance with DoD Instruction 1342.12.									

The period of performance for the proposed contract is anticipated to be a 9-month period of performance, 04/01/2013 to 12/31/2013.
  The total estimated value of the proposed contract is $4.445 million.    

These services will expire under the current contract arrangement with the Department of the Army on 31 March 2013.  NMLC plans to issue a longer-term competitive procurement for EDIS services.  NMLC cannot complete a new competitive award by the 31 March 2013 expiration of the current contract.  The only way to provide uninterrupted services is through the use of a bridge contract.  The bridge contract will provide continuity of EDIS support services necessary to ensure the new competitive procurement has an appropriate timetable to evaluate, award, and implement a new contract.  

Services for this requirement are required OCONUS in Okinawa and Yokosuka Japan, Guam, Naples and Sicily Italy, as well as Rota, Spain.
   The Government recognizes that historically it takes new contractors considerable time (up to 60-90 days) to credential and place employees performing OCONUS due to host country requirements.   Magnum Medical Overseas JV LLC, as the incumbent Contractor already has personnel in place with the unique training and orientation to meet the period of performance start date of 1 April 2013.  No other contractor would be able to recruit, place, and provide specialized training to employees in order to avoid a lapse in service.

<p>Sole Source:<br />The NDBC Weather and Ocean Platform Program uses the Rotronic MP100/101A series humidity probe as the main sensing element in the NDBC humidity sensor assembly currently in use on CMAN and buoy stations. These sensors were selected for use after testing of other vendor units. During the engineering development of the TAO technology refresh, the Rotronic MP101A-C4 Humidity/Air Temperature probe was selected as the hygrometer for the TAO program. <br />The Rotronic HC2-S3 is the most current model of humidity probe which replaces the MP101A unit. The selection of the newer Hc2-S3 probe for both the TAO and WxOP program reduces sparing levels and cost as these sensors can be shared among programs. Automated tests have been developed specifically for these sensors to reduce NDBC calibration laboratory labor.</p>

The Contractor should anticipate delays in getting commercial vehicles on post.  The Contractor must also allow additional time for commercial vehicles to reach their destination by driving through Joint Base Lewis-McChord.  If the commercial vehicle is carrying a load of cement concrete or hot asphalt concrete for delivery, the driver shall notify the gate guard as soon as possible and request that the vehicle be given priority for being searched; however, the Government does not guarantee that the vehicle will be given priority. On weekends large vehicles (needing greater than 12'-5" clearance) will require a time stamped "searched" label to gain access to Joint Base Lewis-North.  "Searched" labels will be issued at the Main Gate, as appropriate.  Drivers needing access to JBLM-North must inform the gate guard that their vehicle is over 12'-5" in height and that they will require access to Joint Base Lewis-North.  The driver will receive a briefing on proper procedures and a "searched" label.  The Contractor shall ensure that its drivers, including drivers of subcontractors at any tier, comply with the procedures as explained to them for access to Joint Base Lewis-North. <BR> <BR>FAST ACCESS GATE PROGRAM (b)  If the contractor participates in the Fast Access Gate Program, contractor vehicles may enter the installation through any fast access gate lane except at Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta.  During Force Protection Level Charlie or Delta, all contractor vehicles must enter through the Logistics Center gate or, if the Logistics Center Gate is closed, through the Main Gate.  All passengers in the contractor vehicle must have a fast access identification card; otherwise, the contractor vehicle must enter through the Logistics Center Gate or the Main Gate, as appropriate and obtain visitor passes.     Once the Fast Access Gate Program is fully implemented, fast access gate lanes will be at the Main (Liberty) Gate, the 41st Street Gate (JBLM-North), the East Gate, the DuPont Gate, the D Street Gate, the Logistics Center Gate, the Madigan Army Medical Center Gate, the Rainier Gate, the Transmission Line Gate, and the Scouts Out Gate.  The contractor shall use only those lanes specifically marked as fast access lanes.    (c)  If the Fast Access Gate Program is terminated for any reason, the contractor will be allowed access only through the Logistics Center Gate or the D St. Gate or, when they are closed, the Main Gate unless the contractor is otherwise notified by the Contracting Officer.    
(d) Employees who require access to JBLM-Main to perform work under this contract may obtain a Government sponsored identification badge.  The identification card process has been contracted out and the cost of the identification card shall be borne by the contractor.  Current established costs are:  $99.00 for company start-up and $99.00 per individual. Name and address of contractor is as follows: Fast Access, Eid Passport, Incorporated, 10450, SW Nimbus Avenue, Bldg R-A, Portland, Oregon 97223, Customer Service: 877-727-4343, Office: 503-924-5300, Fax:  503-924-5320, Maria Nguyen, Manager, Cell:  (None); info@rapidgate.com , mnguyen@eidpassport.com.  If you choose not to obtain a Fast Access Badge, you can obtain permission for a 30-day pass by contacting the ID Card Facility (Waller Hall).  This process may be changed without prior notification, but any long-term badge received by you will continue to be valid until its expiration date. <BR> <BR>THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ASSIST YOU, AND WILL HELP TO EXPEDITE PAPERWORK AND PAYMENT.
     a. Only one delivery will be accepted against each line item.  Backorders will NOT be accepted on individual line items.     b. Deliver on or before date specified.  Deliveries will be accepted Monday through Friday (except Holidays) from 7:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. to Block 15 of the Purchase Order.  Notify the individual in Block 16 of any delay encountered (due to strikes, factory backorders, etc.)  and give revised delivery date if possible.     c. Mark outside of all cartons.  Put packing list inside cartons.  Show the order number assigned, the PR number shown at the end of each item, and the quantity shipped.  All items will be identified by the part number by attached tag and/or stamped identification.     d. On direct shipments, have the supplier or manufacturer cite our order number on packages.  This eliminates delay caused by trying to determine the firm awarded the original order. <BR> <BR>Unless otherwise specified in this contract, the contractor shall obtain any necessary licenses and permits, give all notices, and comply with any applicable Federal, State, County, and municipal laws, codes, and regulations in connection with this award. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall not make news releases or otherwise provide information relative to the performance of this contract or information relative to any incident occurring on JBLM without prior approval of the Contracting Officer. <BR> <BR>Quotes will be evaluated based on price and technical acceptability. The Government intends to award a contract to the offeror who submits the lowest priced technically acceptable offer. 
In order to be considered technically acceptable, the offeror must provide, as an attachment to its offer, documentation which clearly shows that the offered equipment meets the requirements stated in the Item Description.

(1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The FDA is seeking to determine whether the Quoter has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of services at fair and reasonable prices through an assessment of the Quoter's quality of product/service, cost control, business relations, and customer satisfaction.

<p>Quoter's will be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance, and the Quoter's response, or lack thereof, will be taken into consideration. In investigating the Quoter's past performance, the Government will consider references submitted by the Quoter and may consider information from other sources. <br />RATING GUIDELINES</p>

<p>Rating Definition<br />High Performance record(s) identify a preponderance of negative reports of past performance. <br />Medium Performance record(s) identify a combination of positive and negative reports of past performance.<br />Low Performance record(s) identify a preponderance of positive reports of past performance.<br />Neutral Little or no relevant performance record identifiable; equates to an unknown risk rating having no positive or negative evaluation significance.</p>
<p>12.3 Price Proposal<br />The price proposal shall represent the Offeror's response to the requirements of the solicitation. The Government will evaluate the total price and may include an assessment of the Offeror's proposed price based on realism, reasonableness, and risk.</p>

Factor 1:  Personnel Qualifications - The contractor shall offer personnel who have demonstrated abilities and experience in all areas of the Statement of Work including relevant experience with Leadership and Organizational Change in a Patient-Centered Care environment, ability to train, partner & coach with organizational leaders and develop internal resources (what do you mean by "internal resources"?) and experience with measurement and analysis techniques.

Factor 2:  Technical - The contractor shall demonstrate an understanding of the statement of work and clearly state their approach to successfully providing the required services and related support.  The contractor shall demonstrate an understanding that this requirement is not solely a training program but an organization specific, customized culture transformation strategy.    

Factor 3:  Past Performance - The contractor shall demonstrate prior experience working with VA and non-VA healthcare systems, expert knowledge and qualifications for providing program management, integration, and performance evaluation support relevant to the Statement of Work.

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being solicited and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W912L7-13-T-0008 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. The Tennessee Army National Guard has the following requirements. This requirement is being advertised as a small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 562991 with a Small Business Size Standard of seven million dollars ($7,000,000.00) per year.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical ability to meet the statement of work, price and past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation: <br />WD 05-2497 (Rev.-15) was first posted on www.wdol.gov on 06/19/2012<br />************************************************************************************<br />REGISTER OF WAGE DETERMINATIONS UNDER | U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<br />THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT | EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ADMINISTRATION<br />By direction of the Secretary of Labor | WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION<br />| WASHINGTON D.C. 20210<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />| Wage Determination No.: 2005-2497<br />Diane C.

<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years. Length of service includes<br />the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor,<br />wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of<br />similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at http://www.dol.<br />gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web site at<br />http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms, Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (JUL 2006) (Deviation) and 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Quotes are being solicited and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number W912L7-13-T-0009 is hereby issued as a Request for Quote. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65. The Tennessee Army National Guard has the following requirements. This requirement is being advertised as a small business set-aside; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 562991 with a Small Business Size Standard of seven million dollars ($7,000,000.00) per year. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered by this Agency. The following clauses are applicable to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items, 52.212-2 -- Evaluation -- Commercial Items. As prescribed in 12.301(c), the Contracting Officer may insert a provision substantially as follows: Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical ability to meet the statement of work, price and past performance. Technical and past performance, when combined, are approximately equal to price. (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-4 Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, FAR 52.212-5 (Dev) Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items (JUN 2006) (Deviation) 52.216-22 Indefinite Quantity, 52.217-8 -- Option to Extend Services. As prescribed in 17.208(f), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend Services (Nov 1999) The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within five days. 52.217-9 -- Option to Extend the Term of the Contract. As prescribed in 17.208(g), insert a clause substantially the same as the following: Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (Mar 2000) (a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor within three months of contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 30 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension. (b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed five years, 52.232-19 Availability of Funds for the Next Fiscal Year, 52.222-41 Service Contract Act of 1965. As prescribed in 22.1006(a), insert the following clause: Service Contract Act of 1965 (Nov 2007) (a) Definitions. As used in this clause- "Act" means the Service Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351, et seq.). "Contractor," when this clause is used in any subcontract, shall be deemed to refer to the subcontractor, except in the term "Government Prime Contractor." "Service employee" means any person engaged in the performance of this contract other than any person employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity, as these terms are defined in Part 541 of Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, as revised. It includes all such persons regardless of any contractual relationship that may be alleged to exist between a Contractor or subcontractor and such persons. (b) Applicability. This contract is subject to the following provisions and to all other applicable provisions of the Act and regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR Part 4). This clause does not apply to contracts or subcontracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor or exempted by 41 U.S.C. 356, as interpreted in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 4. (c) Compensation. (1) Each service employee employed in the performance of this contract by the Contractor or any subcontractor shall be paid not less than the minimum monetary wages and shall be furnished fringe benefits in accordance with the wages and fringe benefits determined by the Secretary of Labor, or authorized representative, as specified in any wage determination attached to this contract. (2)(i) If a wage determination is attached to this contract, the Contractor shall classify any class of service employee which is not listed therein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage determination) so as to provide a reasonable relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such conformed class of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the fringe benefits as are determined pursuant to the procedures in this paragraph (c). (ii) This conforming procedure shall be initiated by the Contractor prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employee. The Contractor shall submit Standard Form (SF) 1444, Request For Authorization of Additional Classification and Rate, to the Contracting Officer no later than 30 days after the unlisted class of employee performs any contract work. The Contracting Officer shall review the proposed classification and rate and promptly submit the completed SF 1444 (which must include information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the employees' authorized representatives or the employees themselves together with the agency recommendation), and all pertinent information to the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor. The Wage and Hour Division will approve, modify, or disapprove the action or render a final determination in the event of disagreement within 30 days of receipt or will notify the Contracting Officer within 30 days of receipt that additional time is necessary. (iii) The final determination of the conformance action by the Wage and Hour Division shall be transmitted to the Contracting Officer who shall promptly notify the Contractor of the action taken. Each affected employee shall be furnished by the Contractor with a written copy of such determination or it shall be posted as a part of the wage determination. (iv)(A) The process of establishing wage and fringe benefit rates that bear a reasonable relationship to those listed in a wage determination cannot be reduced to any single formula. The approach used may vary from wage determination to wage determination depending on the circumstances. Standard wage and salary administration practices which rank various job classifications by pay grade pursuant to point schemes or other job factors may, for example, be relied upon. Guidance may also be obtained from the way different jobs are rated under Federal pay systems (Federal Wage Board Pay System and the General Schedule) or from other wage determinations issued in the same locality. Basic to the establishment of any conformable wage rate(s) is the concept that a pay relationship should be maintained between job classifications based on the skill required and the duties performed. (B) In the case of a contract modification, an exercise of an option, or extension of an existing contract, or in any other case where a Contractor succeeds a contract under which the classification in question was previously conformed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this clause, a new conformed wage rate and fringe benefits may be assigned to the conformed classification by indexing (i.e., adjusting) the previous conformed rate and fringe benefits by an amount equal to the average (mean) percentage increase (or decrease, where appropriate) between the wages and fringe benefits specified for all classifications to be used on the contract which are listed in the current wage determination, and those specified for the corresponding classifications in the previously applicable wage determination. Where conforming actions are accomplished in accordance with this paragraph prior to the performance of contract work by the unlisted class of employees, the Contractor shall advise the Contracting Officer of the action taken but the other procedures in subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause need not be followed. (C) No employee engaged in performing work on this contract shall in any event be paid less than the currently applicable minimum wage specified under section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. (v) The wage rate and fringe benefits finally determined under this paragraph (c)(2) of this clause shall be paid to all employees performing in the classification from the first day on which contract work is performed by them in the classification. Failure to pay the unlisted employees the compensation agreed upon by the interested parties and/or finally determined by the Wage and Hour Division retroactive to the date such class of employees commenced contract work shall be a violation of the Act and this contract. (vi) Upon discovery of failure to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this clause, the Wage and Hour Division shall make a final determination of conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits which shall be retroactive to the date such class or classes of employees commenced contract work. (3) Adjustment of compensation. If the term of this contract is more than 1 year, the minimum monetary wages and fringe benefits required to be paid or furnished thereunder to service employees under this contract shall be subject to adjustment after 1 year and not less often than once every 2 years, under wage determinations issued by the Wage and Hour Division. (d) Obligation to furnish fringe benefits. The Contractor or subcontractor may discharge the obligation to furnish fringe benefits specified in the attachment or determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this clause by furnishing equivalent combinations of bona fide fringe benefits, or by making equivalent or differential cash payments, only in accordance with Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 4. (e) Minimum wage. In the absence of a minimum wage attachment for this contract, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any person performing work under this contract (regardless of whether the person is a service employee) less than the minimum wage specified by section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Nothing in this clause shall relieve the Contractor or any subcontractor of any other obligation under law or contract for payment of a higher wage to any employee. (f) Successor contracts. If this contract succeeds a contract subject to the Act under which substantially the same services were furnished in the same locality and service employees were paid wages and fringe benefits provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, in the absence of the minimum wage attachment for this contract setting forth such collectively bargained wage rates and fringe benefits, neither the Contractor nor any subcontractor under this contract shall pay any service employee performing any of the contract work (regardless of whether or not such employee was employed under the predecessor contract), less than the wages and fringe benefits provided for in such collective bargaining agreement, to which such employee would have been entitled if employed under the predecessor contract, including accrued wages and fringe benefits and any prospective increases in wages and fringe benefits provided for under such agreement. No Contractor or subcontractor under this contract may be relieved of the foregoing obligation unless the limitations of 29 CFR 4.1b(b) apply or unless the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's authorized representative finds, after a hearing as provided in 29 CFR 4.10 that the wages and/or fringe benefits provided for in such agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, or determines, as provided in 29 CFR 4.11, that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations. Where it is found in accordance with the review procedures provided in 29 CFR 4.10 and/or 4.11 and Parts 6 and 8 that some or all of the wages and/or fringe benefits contained in a predecessor Contractor's collective bargaining agreement are substantially at variance with those which prevail for services of a character similar in the locality, and/or that the collective bargaining agreement applicable to service employees employed under the predecessor contract was not entered into as a result of arm's length negotiations, the Department will issue a new or revised wage determination setting forth the applicable wage rates and fringe benefits. Such determination shall be made part of the contract or subcontract, in accordance with the decision of the Administrator, the Administrative Law Judge, or the Administrative Review Board, as the case may be, irrespective of whether such issuance occurs prior to or after the award of a contract or subcontract (53 Comp. Gen. 401 (1973)). In the case of a wage determination issued solely as a result of a finding of substantial variance, such determination shall be effective as of the date of the final administrative decision. (g) Notification to employees. The Contractor and any subcontractor under this contract shall notify each service employee commencing work on this contract of the minimum monetary wage and any fringe benefits required to be paid pursuant to this contract, or shall post the wage determination attached to this contract. The poster provided by the Department of Labor (Publication WH 1313) shall be posted in a prominent and accessible place at the worksite. Failure to comply with this requirement is a violation of section 2(a)(4) of the Act and of this contract. (h) Safe and sanitary working conditions. The Contractor or subcontractor shall not permit any part of the services called for by this contract to be performed in buildings or surroundings or under working conditions provided by or under the control or supervision of the Contractor or subcontractor which are unsanitary, hazardous, or dangerous to the health or safety of the service employees. The Contractor or subcontractor shall comply with the safety and health standards applied under 29 CFR Part 1925. (i) Records. (1) The Contractor and each subcontractor performing work subject to the Act shall make and maintain for 3 years from the completion of the work, and make them available for inspection and transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, a record of the following: (i) For each employee subject to the Act- (A) Name and address and social security number; (B) Correct work classification or classifications, rate or rates of monetary wages paid and fringe benefits provided, rate or rates of payments in lieu of fringe benefits, and total daily and weekly compensation; (C) Daily and weekly hours worked by each employee; and (D) Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from the total daily or weekly compensation of each employee. (ii) For those classes of service employees not included in any wage determination attached to this contract, wage rates or fringe benefits determined by the interested parties or by the Administrator or authorized representative under the terms of paragraph (c) of this clause. A copy of the report required by subdivision (c)(2)(ii) of this clause will fulfill this requirement. (iii) Any list of the predecessor Contractor's employees which had been furnished to the Contractor as prescribed by paragraph (n) of this clause. (2) The Contractor shall also make available a copy of this contract for inspection or transcription by authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division. (3) Failure to make and maintain or to make available these records for inspection and transcription shall be a violation of the regulations and this contract, and in the case of failure to produce these records, the Contracting Officer, upon direction of the Department of Labor and notification to the Contractor, shall take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violation ceases. (4) The Contractor shall permit authorized representatives of the Wage and Hour Division to conduct interviews with employees at the worksite during normal working hours. (j) Pay periods. The Contractor shall unconditionally pay to each employee subject to the Act all wages due free and clear and without subsequent deduction (except as otherwise provided by law or regulations, 29 CFR Part 4), rebate, or kickback on any account. These payments shall be made no later than one pay period following the end of the regular pay period in which the wages were earned or accrued. A pay period under this Act may not be of any duration longer than semi-monthly. (k) Withholding of payments and termination of contract. The Contracting Officer shall withhold or cause to be withheld from the Government Prime Contractor under this or any other Government contract with the Prime Contractor such sums as an appropriate official of the Department of Labor requests or such sums as the Contracting Officer decides may be necessary to pay underpaid employees employed by the Contractor or subcontractor. In the event of failure to pay any employees subject to the Act all or part of the wages or fringe benefits due under the Act, the Contracting Officer may, after authorization or by direction of the Department of Labor and written notification to the Contractor, take action to cause suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased. Additionally, any failure to comply with the requirements of this clause may be grounds for termination of the right to proceed with the contract work. In such event, the Government may enter into other contracts or arrangements for completion of the work, charging the Contractor in default with any additional cost. (l) Subcontracts. The Contractor agrees to insert this clause in all subcontracts subject to the Act. (m) Collective bargaining agreements applicable to service employees. If wages to be paid or fringe benefits to be furnished any service employees employed by the Government Prime Contractor or any subcontractor under the contract are provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which is or will be effective during any period in which the contract is being performed, the Government Prime Contractor shall report such fact to the Contracting Officer, together with full information as to the application and accrual of such wages and fringe benefits, including any prospective increases, to service employees engaged in work on the contract, and a copy of the collective bargaining agreement. Such report shall be made upon commencing performance of the contract, in the case of collective bargaining agreements effective at such time, and in the case of such agreements or provisions or amendments thereof effective at a later time during the period of contract performance such agreements shall be reported promptly after negotiation thereof. (n) Seniority list. Not less than 10 days prior to completion of any contract being performed at a Federal facility where service employees may be retained in the performance of the succeeding contract and subject to a wage determination which contains vacation or other benefit provisions based upon length of service with a Contractor (predecessor) or successor (29 CFR 4.173), the incumbent Prime Contractor shall furnish the Contracting Officer a certified list of the names of all service employees on the Contractor's or subcontractor's payroll during the last month of contract performance. Such list shall also contain anniversary dates of employment on the contract either with the current or predecessor Contractors of each such service employee. The Contracting Officer shall turn over such list to the successor Contractor at the commencement of the succeeding contract. (o) Rulings and interpretations. Rulings and interpretations of the Act are contained in Regulations, 29 CFR Part 4. (p) Contractor's certification. (1) By entering into this contract, the Contractor (and officials thereof) certifies that neither it (nor he or she) nor any person or firm who has a substantial interest in the Contractor's firm is a person or firm ineligible to be awarded Government contracts by virtue of the sanctions imposed under section 5 of the Act. (2) No part of this contract shall be subcontracted to any person or firm ineligible for award of a Government contract under section 5 of the Act. (3) The penalty for making false statements is prescribed in the U.S. Criminal Code, 18 U.S.C. 1001. (q) Variations, tolerances, and exemptions involving employment. Notwithstanding any of the provisions in paragraphs (b) through (o) of this clause, the following employees may be employed in accordance with the following variations, tolerances, and exemptions, which the Secretary of Labor, pursuant to section 4(b) of the Act prior to its amendment by Pub. L. 92-473, found to be necessary and proper in the public interest or to avoid serious impairment of the conduct of Government business: (1) Apprentices, student-learners, and workers whose earning capacity is impaired by age, physical or mental deficiency, or injury may be employed at wages lower than the minimum wages otherwise required by section 2(a)(1) or 2(b)(1) of the Act without diminishing any fringe benefits or cash payments in lieu thereof required under section 2(a)(2) of the Act, in accordance with the conditions and procedures prescribed for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, and handicapped clients of sheltered workshops under section 14 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, in the regulations issued by the Administrator (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (2) The Administrator will issue certificates under the Act for the employment of apprentices, student-learners, handicapped persons, or handicapped clients of sheltered workshops not subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, or subject to different minimum rates of pay under the two acts, authorizing appropriate rates of minimum wages (but without changing requirements concerning fringe benefits or supplementary cash payments in lieu thereof), applying procedures prescribed by the applicable regulations issued under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 CFR parts 520, 521, 524, and 525). (3) The Administrator will also withdraw, annul, or cancel such certificates in accordance with the regulations in 29 CFR parts 525 and 528. (r) Apprentices. Apprentices will be permitted to work at less than the predetermined rate for the work they perform when they are employed and individually registered in a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State Apprenticeship Agency which is recognized by the U.S. Department of Labor, or if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Office of Apprenticeship Training, Employer, and Labor Services (OATELS), U.S. Department of Labor. Any employee who is not registered as an apprentice in an approved program shall be paid the wage rate and fringe benefits contained in the applicable wage determination for the journeyman classification of work actually performed. The wage rates paid apprentices shall not be less than the wage rate for their level of progress set forth in the registered program, expressed as the appropriate percentage of the journeyman's rate contained in the applicable wage determination. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen employed on the contract work in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the Contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. (s) Tips. An employee engaged in an occupation in which the employee customarily and regularly receives more than $30 a month in tips may have the amount of these tips credited by the employer against the minimum wage required by section 2(a)(1) or section 2(b)(1) of the Act, in accordance with section 3(m) of the Fair Labor Standards Act and Regulations, 29 CFR Part 531. However, the amount of credit shall not exceed $1.34 per hour beginning January 1, 1981. To use this provision- (1) The employer must inform tipped employees about this tip credit allowance before the credit is utilized; (2) The employees must be allowed to retain all tips (individually or through a pooling arrangement and regardless of whether the employer elects to take a credit for tips received); (3) The employer must be able to show by records that the employee receives at least the applicable Service Contract Act minimum wage through the combination of direct wages and tip credit; and (4) The use of such tip credit must have been permitted under any predecessor collective bargaining agreement applicable by virtue of section 4(c) of the Act. (t) Disputes concerning labor standards. The U.S. Department of Labor has set forth in 29 CFR parts 4, 6, and 8 procedures for resolving disputes concerning labor standards requirements. Such disputes shall be resolved in accordance with those procedures and not the Disputes clause of this contract. Disputes within the meaning of this clause include disputes between the Contractor (or any of its subcontractors) and the contracting agency, the U.S. Department of Labor, or the employees or their representatives. The following wage rates apply to any contract resulting from this solicitation: <br />WD 05-2497 (Rev.-15) was first posted on www.wdol.gov on 06/19/2012<br />************************************************************************************<br />REGISTER OF WAGE DETERMINATIONS UNDER | U.S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR<br />THE SERVICE CONTRACT ACT | EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ADMINISTRATION<br />By direction of the Secretary of Labor | WAGE AND HOUR DIVISION<br />| WASHINGTON D.C. 20210<br />|<br />|<br />|<br />| Wage Determination No.: 2005-2497<br />Diane C.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />____________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.71 per hour or $148.40 per week or $643.07 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 10 years, and 4 after 15 years. Length of service includes<br />the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or successor,<br />wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the performance of<br />similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year, New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor<br />Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE NUMBERED FOOTNOTES IN PARENTHESES RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>1) COMPUTER EMPLOYEES: Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does<br />not apply to any employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive,<br />administrative, or professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because<br />most Computer System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate<br />not less than $27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per<br />week) an hour would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.<br />400) wage rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations<br />within those job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not<br />list a wage rate for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey<br />data indicates that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds<br />$27.63 per hour conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For<br />example, if an individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties<br />within the scope of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer<br />occupations for which this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate,<br />then the wage rate for that employee must be conformed in accordance with the<br />conformance procedures described in the conformance note included on this wage<br />determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or explosives.<br />Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance operations<br />on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All operations<br />involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet.

<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation(s) and computes a proposed rate(s).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title(s), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification(s), job description(s), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate(s), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.<br />DFARS 252.212-7001 Contract Terms, Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Applicable to Defense Acquisitions of Commercial Items (JUL 2006) (Deviation) and 252.232-7003 Electronic Submission of Payment Requests and Receiving Reports.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet. NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable. Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Naval Sea Systems Command.

This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
 Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is N66604-13-Q-1036. Incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-61. NAICS Code is 611310, Size standard is $7.0M. 

NUWC Division Newport intends to purchase the following on a Sole Source Basis: 
CLIN 0001: Use of lab facilities for 6 months 
CLIN 0002 OPTION 1:  Use of lab facilities for 6 months
CLIN 0003 OPTION 2:  Use of lab facilities for 6 months

It is expected to place a purchase order with the University of Connecticut.  This action is a direct follow on to N6660412P1073 awarded to the University of Connecticut.  UCONN is the only vendor that can supply because the Government is performing testing to optimize the results of the previous purchase order.
  The equipment and lab facilities must remain constant to ensure accurate results. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Offers for other products must contain complete product information and prices.

<DESC><p class="MsoNormal">This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This combined synopsis/solicitation is issued as a request for proposals.</p>
<p>The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-65.</p>
<p>The Department of State, Office of Fine Arts (M/FA) intends to establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement for decorative painting services as described in further detail below for the Diplomatic Reception Rooms at the Harry S Truman Building in Washington D.C. This acquisition is being issued under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. This announcement constitutes only the solicitation, which is hereby issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) to establish Blanket Purchase Agreement. There will be no guaranteed minimum quantities purchased and the Government will be obligated only to the extent of authorized calls placed against the resulting Agreement.</p>
<p>System for Award Management (SAM) applies to this procurement. You must be registered in SAM in order to be eligible to receive an award from this solicitation. Information on SAM registration and annual confirmation requirements may be obtained via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov. Prospective contractors must be registered in SAM database prior to award. Lack of registration in SAM database will make an offeror ineligible for award. CONTRACTORS MUST COMPLY WITH FAR 52.204-99 System for Award Management (SAM) Registration (August 2012) (DEVIATION).</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 238320 with a small business size standard of $14,000,000.00 in average annual receipts for the past 3 years.  Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This requirement will be a 100% Total Small Business Set Aside.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement:</strong><br />The Government intends to award one or award more than one Blanket Purchase Agreement; however, the Government reserves the right not to award any BPA. The Government does not guarantee any order placements. Any resultant BPA(s) will be five (5) years in duration; however, either party may terminate the resulting BPA with 30 calendar days notice.</p>
<p>The Government seeks to establish a BPA for the performance of professional decorative painting services in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms of the Harry S Truman Building in Washington D.C.  The art and architecture of the Diplomatic Reception Rooms is modeled after the great American interiors: Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, Benjamin Chew's Cliveden, and John MacPherson's Mount Pleasant.  These interiors were painted with historic colorants made for the U.S. Department of State by architects Walter Macomber, Edward Vason Jones, and John Blatteau.  Today, these reception rooms and principal offices require annual and ongoing maintenance.  The Contractor will conduct a condition assessment of the painted interiors at the U.S. Department of State, identifying short- and long-term objectives over the five-year period and making best practice recommendations for care and preservation of these surfaces with respect to environmental conditions and functional requirements of these entertaining spaces.</p>
<p>To preserve original workmanship to the fullest extent possible, the Contractor will work with original custom colorants developed for the Department and adapt these colorants to existing paint conditions in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms using decorative techniques where necessary (stenciling, graining, marbleizing, and trompe l'oeil).  A high proficiency in faux bois and faux marbre must be shown.  The Contractor will address a variety of surface materials: plaster with hand-carved ornamental elements, faux-graining architectural elements (alcoves, balustrades as well as Doric and Corinthian columns), and mortise-and-tenon paneling.  <br /><br />Moreover, the Contractor must replicate appearance of historic paints (non-uniform coloration from coarse pigments as well as uneven surface texture imparted by early brushes) and composition (use of tinted glazes, with colors imparted by natural pigments).  As the architecture includes late colonial and early Federal periods, the Contractor must be knowledgeable of synthetic colorants, including admixture of turpentine for relative flat or glossy appearance, which emerged during the first decades of the nineteenth century. The Contractor must have knowledge of regional variations among city-centers (Boston, Philadelphia, and New York) and the ways in which colorants, glazing, and techniques evolved during historic and stylistic periods with respect to decorative treatments used in America.  The Contractor must also have a thorough understanding of paint application using traditional methods.</p>
<p>The Contractor advises the Curator of Collections as a technical experts drawing from multiple years of experience working with Government collections in the Washington, DC, region.  This includes a thorough working knowledge of historic colorants through the colonial and federal periods with specific understanding of regional and revival styles where necessary.  In addition, the Contractor makes recommendations for ways in which these colorants will appear under florescent, incandescent, and natural lighting conditions in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms.  The Contractor must have extensive experience working with museums and in a manner consistent with recommendations of AIC and AAM for the care and preservation of the historic collection at the Department.  With respect to decorative painting, the Contractor must be considered a subject expert by the nation's leading museums.</p>
<p>The painted interiors of historic structures reflect the progression of stylistic movements in America.  Often the original painted surfaces are concealed by successive layers of paint.  Any approach requires a preliminary paint investigation, consideration of possible treatment goals (preservation, rehabilitation, or restoration), and mitigation of environmental causes (surface abrasion, accumulation, light pollution, and/or water).  The Contractor must have demonstrated understanding of incompatible paints (acrylic latex, oil/alkyd, and calcimine) when knowledge of original formula is not available.  Further, as the Diplomatic Reception Rooms were fashioned after the Colonial Revival, many of the interiors have raised paneling, requiring sanding (rotten stone or pumice) between paint applications and specialized hand-brushes and techniques for durable finishes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /><strong>Evaluation criteria:</strong><br />The procurement is being conducted under FAR Part 15.101-1. The acquisition evaluation will be conducted utilizing a best value -tradeoff source selection process, which seeks to select an offer with the overall best value to meet the government's need. Best value is defines as the expected outcome of an acquisition that, in the Government's estimation, provides the greatest overall benefit in response to the requirement, in accordance with FAR 2.101.</p>
<p>The best value will be determined by comparing differences in the value of non-price features in cost to the Government. In making this comparison, the Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical, non-price features than with making an award at the lowest overall cost to the Government. However, the Government will not make an award at a significantly higher overall cost to achieve slightly superior technical, non-price features.</p>
<p>Therefore, price/cost is not expected to be the controlling factor in the selection of an offeror, but the degree of importance of cost as a factor could become greater depending on the quality of the proposals for other factors evaluated.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to make a selection based upon the initial proposal submissions so the offeror should submit its best terms in the initial proposal. The Government may also determine to make no award.</p>
<p>A single offeror will be selected who is deemed responsible in accordance with FAR 9.104-1 and whose offer provides the Government with a best value solution.</p>
<p><br />FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Capability, Key Personnel, and Past Performance. <br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Technical Capability:</strong><br />Offerors must demonstrate an understanding of the performance requirements and an ability to execute them in accordance with the Statement of Work. In evaluating technical capability, the Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the work and soundness of their approach to specifically include an offeror's ability to provide the required services necessary to successfully execute the SOW requirements. In evaluating the offeror's technical capability, the Government will evaluate the offeror's understanding of the complete scope and complexity of performance requirements as it relates to the proposed skill mix and level of effort. This will be evaluated as a measure of the Government's confidence in the offeror's ability to plan for, manage, and staff the requirement.</p>
<p>Submissions for technical proposals shall not exceed ten (10) pages excluding title pages, table of contents, and graphics.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Key Personnel:</strong><br />Offerors must demonstrate that there will be knowledgeable and skilled personnel performing the required duties. Key personnel must have in-depth experience in specialized decorative painting with similar projects.</p>
<p><strong>Corporate Past Performance: </strong><br />Offerors must demonstrate proof of corporate past performance in work related to this requirement. The personnel must have in-depth experience in specialized decorative painting with similar projects. Companies must have experience handling detailed painting projects in historically significant settings</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong><br />The offeror shall also provide a written price proposal. All services for each period of performance are to be labor hours with firm fixed hourly rates. The offeror's price proposal should include labor categories, and fully burdened labor rates.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will establish call limitations in writing for individuals who are authorized to place calls. The call limit for each individual may vary.</p>
<p>The Government will notify the offeror of the names of individuals who will be authorized to place calls against any resulting BPA. The BPA will identify the names of the individuals authorized to schedule deliveries under the Agreement. Only authorized Government employees who have been specifically named by the Contracting Officer may schedule deliveries under this agreement. STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THIS STIPULATION IS IMPERATIVE.</p>
<p><strong>Proposal Submission: </strong><br />Proposal must be submitted electronically to dermidoffpt@state.gov. The due date is Friday, March 22 at 12PM EST. All proposals as well as inquiries should be sent electronically to:</p>

Priority of past performance information requested:  1.) If available, submit Architect-Engineer Contract Administration Support System (ACASS) Performance Evaluations ratings.  2.) For projects which were designed for other government entities, submit the performance appraisal sheets used by that government entity if available.  3.) For projects not covered in the ACASS database or by other governmental performance appraisal sheets, submit a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) (see c. below for information regarding PPQs).<br><br>b.	ACASS Evaluations<br><br>Firms are requested to retrieve their ACASS past performance information directly from the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) at http://www.ppirs.gov.  PPIRS is an electronic repository of performance information collected by all the major federal performance reporting systems.  Logging onto PPIRS will require the following:  All firms must have purchased and installed a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) certificate.  If you do not have this certificate, you cannot access your information.  Additional information about the PKI certificate is posted in red at the top, center portion, of the http://www.ppirs.gov web page.  You will also need your DUNS number and Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) to log onto PPIRS.  The MPIN number was selected by whoever registered your firm in the Central Contractor Registration database at http://www.ccr.gov .  If you do not know your MPIN number, you will need to contact the CCR help desk by emailing them from the email link on the http://www.ccr.gov/help.asp web page.  Please be aware that they will only release the MPIN number to the person who originally registered your firm.<br><br>There are two other ways to obtain a copy of ACASS evaluations as follows: (1) Contact your government point of contact for the project you mentioned, and ask them if they can send you a copy, or (2) Apply for "Contractor Corporate Senior Management Representative" access on the following ACASS web page:  http://www.cpars.csd.disa.mil/. This type of access is issued to only one person within the firm, typically a member of senior management.  In addition to access to your completed ACASS performance evaluations, you will also be able to view status of evaluations which have not yet been completed.  Following receipt of your faxed application request, you will be emailed a logon and access instructions.  This type of access will only let you see ACASS information, so it is not as complete as PPIRS access which allows access to evaluations prepared by non-DOD federal agencies, as well as the DOD agencies which use ACASS.  Be aware that you will also need to have a PKI certificate to access the ACASS system.  This is a DOD requirement.<br><br>c.	Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ)<br><br>The Past Performance Questionnaire is provided for the offeror (available as a download with this announcement - see the "Packages" tab) or its team members to submit to the client.  The Past Performance Questionnaire should be completed by an owner or owner's representative not affiliated with your firm.  Ensure correct phone numbers and email addresses are provided for the client point of contact.<br><br>Completed Past Performance Questionnaires should be submitted with your proposal. If the offeror is unable to obtain a completed PPQ from a client for a project(s) before proposal closing date, the offeror should complete and submit with the proposal the first page of the PPQ, which will provide contract and client information for the respective project(s).  Offerors should follow-up with clients/references to ensure timely submittal of questionnaires.  Offerors shall not incorporate by reference into their proposal PPQs previously submitted for other RFPs; however, they may be submitted in full text if they exist (i.e. offerors are not required to re-obtain PPQs for the same project).  PPQs already in the possession of Offerors may be on other/previous versions of PPQs.  New PPQs must only be obtained on the form available for download with this announcement and submitted for projects for which the Offeror does not already have a completed PPQ, in one version or another (and, again, PPQs are only required if ACASS or other governmental performance appraisal sheets are not available for submission with the Offer - see a. above).<br><br>d.	Government Utilization of Alternate Information Sources for Past Performance<br><br>The Government will assess the past performance on projects submitted and reserves the right to conduct telephone interviews with points of contact identified in the proposal or to review personal knowledge.  In addition, the Government may review any other sources of information for evaluating past performance of the Offeror on the submitted projects and any other previous work. Other sources may include, but are not limited to, past performance information retrieved through the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS), including Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), using all CAGE/DUNS numbers of team members (partnership, joint venture, teaming arrangement, or parent company/subsidiary/affiliate) identified in the offeror's proposal, inquiries of owner representative(s), Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), Electronic Subcontract Reporting System (eSRS), and any other known sources not provided by the offeror.<br><br>While the Government may elect to consider data from other sources, the burden of providing detailed, current, accurate and complete past performance information rests with the Offeror.<br><br>(13)	Volume of Department of Defense (DOD) contract awards the Contractor has received and has active actions on in the last twelve (12) months.<br><br>Announcement Section C - Ratings and Definitions<br><br>i.	The following ratings will be used to evaluate documentation submitted by offerors (note that documentation submitted for evaluation in response to this announcement may be referred to throughout this announcement as an "offer", "proposal", or "response" - all of which are representative of the SF330 information being requested by this announcement):<br><br>	Exceptional - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in the majority of the aspects of the particular factor. Strengths are present indicating maximum benefit to the government and no weaknesses, significant weaknesses or deficiencies are indicated.<br><br>	Above Average - The offer exceeds the scope of the announcement requirements in many aspects of the particular factor.  Strengths are present indicating significant benefit to the government.  The proposal may have weaknesses that have no impact on the proposal as a whole and do not require correction.  <br><br>	Average - The offer matches the scope of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be strengths but they may not aggregate into an advantage indicating additional benefit to the Government, or they may be offset by weaknesses.  Any weaknesses noted have only a minor impact on the proposal and are easily correctable.  <br><br>	Marginal - The offer matches some, but not all, of the announcement requirements of the particular factor.  There may be limited or individual strengths, but they do not aggregate into an advantage and are offset by weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies.  Weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies are correctable without major revision to the proposal.  The Government may still receive benefit from the offer submitted.<br><br>	Unacceptable - The offer fails to meet a majority of announcement requirements or has omitted critical information required to evaluate the factor.  There are no strengths.  The offer contains multiple weaknesses, significant weaknesses and/or deficiencies, which are all correctable only with major revision to the proposal.  A proposal that receives a final rating of "Unacceptable" for any factor may not be considered for award.<br><br>	Neutral - In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the offeror may not be evaluated either favorably or unfavorably on past performance.<br><br>ii.	Definitions:<br><br>Strength - Any aspect of a proposal that, when judged against a stated evaluation factor, enhances the merit of the proposal or increases the probability of successful performance of the contract.<br><br>Weakness - A flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.  A "significant weakness" in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance.<br><br>Deficiency - A material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a combination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract performance to an unacceptable level.<br><br>Announcement Section D - Submission Instructions, Selection Process and Additional Information<br><br>i.	Eligible interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit ONE (1) ORIGINAL AND TWO (2) COPIES, each containing Parts I and II of the SF330 information for the prime firm and all subcontractors/subconsultants (as necessary), as directed with respect to time, date, place of receiving proposals and acceptable methods of delivery identified in item iii. of this Announcement Section D.  Part I, Part II and Sections of the submitted SF330 information (reference SF330 instructions for definitions of Part I, Part II and Sections) of each copy shall be separated by tabs (dividers) and clearly marked.  Part I, Section H shall include all information requested per this announcement that does not reasonably fit, in the offeror's best estimation, into any other Sections of SF330 Part I or Part II.<br><br>FOR THE PRIME OFFEROR, PROVIDE THE FIRM'S DUNS NUMBER AND CAGE CODE IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK B, BOX 5.  FOR SUBCONTRACTORS/SUBCONSULTANTS, PROVIDE THESE FIRMS' DUNS NUMBERS AND CAGE CODES IN SF330, PART I, BLOCK C, BOX 9.<br><br>All proposers, including joint-ventures, must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR)  at https://www.bpn.gov/ccr/ and have completed their Online Representations and Certification Application (ORCA) at https://orca.bpn.gov/.<br><br>All proposals submitted will become, upon receipt, the property of the U.S. Government and will not be returned.  After evaluation of proposals, the original will be retained for the official contract file.  Extra copies of the awardee's proposal may be provided to other offices for carrying out contract administration functions.  Any extra copies of proposals deemed unnecessary by the government will be destroyed.<br><br>ii.	Upon completion of evaluation of the SF330s received, a short list of most qualified firms will be determined.  Until selection is completed, there will be no notification of any type to proposing firms.  Once the short list is approved by the Source Selection Authority, those firms that did not make the short list will be promptly notified.  There will be up to three (3) contracts awarded as a result of negotiations.  Each contract will have a period of performance (i.e. ordering period) of five (5) years from the date of basic IDIQ contract award and $5 million in capacity. <br><br>iii.	Completed SF 330 information must reach the Contracting Division Offices not later than 2:00 p.m. (Central/local time) on Tuesday, 24-Apr-2012.  All questions concerning this announcement should be addressed to Edward Jackson, Contract Specialist, by email at edward.j.jackson@usace.army.mil.<br><br>The packaging that contains the response materials must be SEALED and MARKED:<br><br>"Response to Announcement No. W9128F-12-R-0027; to be opened by Contraction Division personnel ONLY."

On the date specified and for thirty (30) minutes prior to the specified time, a Contracting representative will be in the lobby of the building at the above address to receive offers. Containers (e.g. envelopes, packages, boxes) will be screened for security purposes.  Hand-carried means the individual must be able to carry on their person.  If due to size or volume, packages or boxes need to be wheeled in on a cart or dolly, you will be required to go to the dock area located on the northeast side of the facility. After inspection and screening, you will be allowed in the building after presenting valid photo identification.  At the offer due date/time specified above, it will be announced that receipt of proposals is closed. Official time will be established by a clock designated by the Contracting representative receiving hand-carried proposals, to be located in the area of proposals being received.  Recent terrorist threats have resulted in more time-consuming sign-in and escort procedures and may impact the timely delivery of offers.  This instruction shall also apply to those proposals delivered through a delivery or parcel service.  NOTE:  No parking on the street in front of the facility entrances will be allowed.  Passenger vehicles will need to locate parking meters or parking garages before delivering proposals.  Delivery trucks must go to the dock.  The vehicle will be inspected and packages screened at the dock.  After inspection and screening, the delivery person will be allowed into the building.<br><br>Requests for in-person visits for the purpose of discussing this announcement will not be scheduled.

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Phillip.A.Will@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 06MAR13 0930 Pacific Time.</p>

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.

The Government will only accept a Class of antenna if all of the antennas in that Class are proposed. The Government will not consider any offer that does not include all of the antennas found in a particular class. The TEP will be determined based on the prices proposed for all the antennas in a particular class. The Government will award to the responsible Offeror(s) whose proposal(s), in response to the solicitation, provides the Government the lowest evaluated price, and meets the acceptability standards on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Price:</p>
<p>The price proposal will be evaluated for completeness to ensure pricing has been submitted for all items in a particular class of antenna (Platform, Deployable, or Lightweight).

The Government will determine a Total Evaluated Price (TEP) for each Schedule proposed class of antenna based upon known Government requirements for the five-year ordering period. The TEP will be calculated per antenna class by multiplying the Government provided "TEP Evaluated QTY" by the Offeror's proposed antenna price. The sum of all calculated prices for each CLIN will determine the TEP per antenna class.</p>
<p>Factor 2 - Technical:</p>
<p>Each Technical sub-factor will receive a rating of acceptable or unacceptable. If any sub-factor is rated - "unacceptable," the entire proposal will be rated technically unacceptable, and the proposal will be excluded from award consideration.</p>
<p>Sub-factor 1: Technical Capability - Technical Capability - The Government will rate the Offeror's technical capability as "acceptable" if the Offeror provides documented evidence of meeting all the technical requirements stated in the Statement of Work and Antenna Performance Characteristics (per class of antennas).</p>
<p>Sub-factor 2: Delivery Schedule - The Government will evaluate the Offeror's delivery schedule proposed for each CLIN. The Government will rate the Offeror's delivery schedule as "acceptable" if at least the first 25 antennas of each CLIN proposed will be delivered within 90 days ARO.</p>

<DESC>Field Artillery Survey System Technology  <br>  Purpose:  The Army Contracting Command (ACC) New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ  07806-5000 is conducting a Market Survey on behalf of the Joint Program Manager Office Towed Artillery Systems (PM-TAS) and Research Development and Engineering Command - Armament Research Development and Engineering Center (RDECOM-ARDEC) to identify technology currently available to refresh the Improved Position and Azimuth Determining System with Global Positioning System (IPADS-G).    <br>  Description: This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or an obligation on the part of PM-TAS or RDECOM-ARDEC. The purpose of the IPADS-G system is to provide accurate navigational and survey data to the war fighter at the unit level. The primary intent is to support howitzer fire missions by obtaining accurate Survey Control Points (SCPs) and to lay azimuths for indirect fire. In doing so, the IPADS-G provides a common grid at the accuracies required to support indirect fire missions as opposed to standalone GPS systems which provide an absolute GPS solution. The intent of this Sources Sought is to identify qualified vendors that have available technology capable of meeting the current IPADS-G performance requirements in a smaller form factor and which also provide the capability of being upgraded to meet future emerging requirements.  For each available technology, interested vendors are requested to provide a white paper summarizing the following elements of their proposed design:  <br>    <br>  a.	Design Description.  All interested vendors are requested to provide a brief description of their design, including a list of the major design elements, a description of how they are integrated, and an explanation of how those elements  interface with each other.    <br>    <br>  b.	 Technical Requirements.  All interested vendors are requested to provide an assessment of their proposed design against the following technical requirements.    <br>    <br>  -	Performance and Environmental Requirements.  The system should be capable of meeting all current IPADS-G performance requirements, and capable of operating and surviving in all current IPADS-G environments (see  MIL-PRF-52955D)  <br>  -	 Physical Requirements.  The complete system (including any required batteries, cables and/or mounting hardware not specific to the vehicle) should have a maximum combined weight of no greater than 60 pounds (Threshold), 40 pounds (Objective).   <br>  -	 Interface Requirements.  The system should be capable of being employable and transportable in a wide range of ground and air platforms .  The system should be capable of being configured for simple and rapid exchange between supporting platforms without permanent modification to the platform or itself.  <br>  -	 Power Requirements.  The system should be capable of using the host platform's electrical power to operate.  The system should possess an internal battery to power the system when not powered by the host platform.  This internal battery shall be charged by the host platform during operation.  <br>    <br>  c.	 Design Readiness.  All interested vendors are requested to provide an assessment of the technical and manufacturing readiness of their design.  If the design is in production, all interested vendors are requested to provide a summary statement on the number of units produced.    <br>    <br>  d.	GPS M-Code compliance.  All interested vendors are to provide an assessment of their designs current and future compliance with GPS-M code.  <br>    <br>  e.	Digital Communications.  All interested vendors are requested to provide an assessment of their design's current and potential future ability to accept digital communications.    <br>    <br>  f.	 Cost. All interested vendors are requested to provide a Rough Order Magnitude of the projected costs of their design in the following areas:  <br>  -	Non Recurring Engineering and Qualification  <br>  -	Unit Production Cost for quantities of 1 to 100, 100 to 500 and 500 to 1,000 units.  <br>  Only written responses to this Sources Sought are requested.  The Government currently anticipates issuance of a follow-on Sources Sought with more refined requirements based upon feedback from this Sources Sought.  As part of the follow-on Sources Sought, a prototype of the proposed system may be requested to be available within 120 days for Government evaluation of available technology.  Further information on the requirements, evaluation plan, and schedule for the prototype evaluation system will be provided in the follow-on Sources Sought.  However, continuation of this effort past the initial Sources Sought is discretionary and the Government is under no obligation to issue a follow-on Sources Sought.  <br>   Submissions of designs that are not fully compliant with all requirements are also encouraged so that PM-TAS and RDECOM-ARDEC may assess the capabilities of all currently available technologies. The Government recognizes that proprietary and/or classified data may be a part of this effort.  If so, clearly mark such restricted/proprietary and classified data and present them as an addendum to the nonrestricted/non-proprietary and unclassified information.  As a result of this Sources Sought a Request For Proposal (RFP) may be issued to develop a fully compliant system. A full specification will be released if and when there is follow on procurement activity. All interested sources are encouraged to submit their abilities/capabilities no later than 45 days from date of this publication to: Christina.a.makhijani.civ@mail.mil, 973-724-1490 and albert.a.rinaldi.civ@mail.mil, 973-724-3071; ACC-NJ-JA Bldg. 9, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000; Please include company name, address, telephone number, point of contact, brochures/literature, etc., and any prior performance relating to this equipment. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION AND DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION. Please be advised that the government will not pay for any information submitted under this announcement. Electronic submittals are preferred.   <br>

The current task orders are W91WAW-07-D-0034-0018 and W91WAW-07-D-0034-0019.  <br>        <br>    4. Is the government open to the use of existing GSA GWAC's? This is as sources sought notice for market research. All possibilities will be considered for acquisition strategy.    <br>        <br>    5. Other than the listed questions and page criteria listed under the Synopsis for this sources sought, is there a specific format for responses to this market research? No    <br>      <br>   6. Are the current SDLC services delivered at CMMI Level 4? No. However, as the PWS reads, level 3 is what is required. Maintianing a CMMI Maturity Level 3 is required and achiveiving a CMMI Maturity Level 4.    <br>      <br>   7. Must small business be appraised at CMMI Level 4 or merely conduct the project at CMMI Level 4? The small business needs to be appraised at CMMI Level 3 and show how they plan on getting us to level 4.   <br>      <br>   8. Would it satisy the Government's requirment if the small business (holding CMMI ML 2or 3) teamed with a partner that held the CMMI ML 4? Again, at least level 3 is required, not level 4. However, they need to show how they would get us to level 4. Level 2 is not acceptable.   <br>    <br>  9. For the referenced solicitation (Sources Sought), is the contracting office interested in receiving a response from companies that are on the Alliant Small Business contract but that exceed the $25.5M revenue standard?  Alliant Small Business primes will be recertified in 2014; until then, companies that currently exceed the original size standard, like DMI, are permitted to bid for solicitations released under the vehicle.   <br>  Small businesses have to meet the size standard of the NAICS code in order to be considered a small business concern.  <br>      <br> 10. What would be the Due time to submit the RFI response? 4:00 PM EST on 28 February 2013. <br>  <br> 11. Is the incumbemt still eligible to bid for this requirement? Yes <br>  <br> 12. Is the Facility Clearance required, if required at what level, do we need FCL before the contract award or after the contract award?

<DESC>Product Manager Soldier Maneuver Sensors and Lasers of the Program Executive Office -Soldier, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060 has a requirement for an integrated procurement that combines the acquisition of the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle III (ENVG III) with the Family of Weapon Sights - Individual (FWS-I).  The ENVG III is a follow-on contract strategy to previous ENVG procurements (ENVG I, ENVG II).  The distinction of ENVG III from previous ENVGs procured to date is the added Rapid Target Acquisition (RTA) technology when used with the FWS-I.  The FWS-I will be a weapon mounted long wave infrared sensor used for surveillance and fire control of individual weapons during daylight, darkness, adverse weather and dirty battlefield conditions.  When combined with the ENVG III, the FWS-I provides RTA which will wirelessly send weapon imagery (with reticle) spatially aligned with the ENVG III image.  The RTA capability will reduce by up to 50 percent the Soldier's time from target detection to effective engagement of the threat target with their host weapon.  This will improve Soldier lethality, enhance Soldier effectiveness and improve Soldier survivability by reducing Soldier exposure to threat weapons.  All systems, components and spares being procured under this acquisition are subject to the Buy American Act and Berry Amendment.  <br>    <br> This requirement is for the continued production phase of the ENVG system (ENVG III) and the FWS-I Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) phases. The anticipated period of performance is a five year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract.  <br> The Government anticipates full & open competition under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 333314 - Night vision optical device manufacturing.  <br> The release of the DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) is tentatively planned for mid March 2013, with all the solicitation and amendments posted at the FedBizOpps website located at the following web address: https://www.fbo.gov/.  Instructions to receive limited distribution documents, to include all product descriptions and specifications will be provided with the draft solicitation and resultant final solicitation. No hard copies of this RFP will be issued. All respondents shall be responsible for obtaining documentation from this location.  <br>    <br> Point of Contact (POC) - Andrew Mitchell  <br> E-mail: andrew.c.mitchell1.civ@mail.mil  <br>

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1313.106?2?70, insert the following provision: Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Date) All solicitations using simplified acquisition procedures in FAR Part 13 must include provision 1352.213?70, Evaluation Utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures, or similar language setting out evaluation criteria.The Government will issue an order resulting from this request for quotation to the responsible offeror whose quotation results in the best value to the Government, considering both price and non-price factors. <BR> <BR>Insert a clause substantially similar to 1352.246?70, Place of Acceptance, in contracts and solicitations to indicate where the acceptance of supplies and/or services will take place.
As prescribed in 1346.503, insert the following clause: Place of Acceptance (APR 2010) (a) The Contracting Officer or the duly authorized representative will accept supplies and services to be provided under this contract. (b) The place of acceptance will be: <BR> <BR>New equipment ONLY, NO grey market or refurbished products. Items must be in original packaging, never used, and not altered in any way. Components of the requested equipment, to include memory, must be manufacturer-approved and may not be compatible, remanufactured, or refurbished equipment. All items must be covered by manufacturer?s warranty and procured through a manufacturer approved distribution channel. Sellers must be able to document their ability to provide items through manufacturer approved distribution channels upon request.
The Seller confirms to have sourced all products submitted in this Bid from manufacturer-approved channels for Federal sales, in accordance with all applicable laws and manufacturer?s current applicable policies at the time of purchase. Seller must be able to support both the product sale and product pricing, in accordance with applicable manufacturer certification / specialization requirements. If software is provided or included, Seller shall, upon request, provide Buyer with a copy of the End User License Agreement. Seller certifies that all software is licensed originally to Buyer as the original licensee authorized to use the software. <BR> <BR>All Bids must be valid for 30 days from the closing date for this solicitation. No exceptions or qualifications. <BR> <BR>Shipping must be free on board (FOB) destination CONUS (Continental U.S.), which means that the seller must deliver the goods on its conveyance at the destination specified by the buyer, and the seller is responsible for the cost of shipping and risk of loss prior to actual delivery at the specified destination. <BR> <BR>Offeror must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database before an award can be made to them.  If the offeror is not registered in the CCR, it may do so through the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov. <BR> <BR>No bids will be accepted from bidders proposing to use another firm?s GSA schedule, even if they have permission of the firm to use it. The bidder must be the owner of the GSA schedule in order to bid and to be considered for award. Bids that do not comply with this offer term will be removed from consideration. By proactively complying with this offer term, Sellers accept that the Government will make award to the GSA schedule holder only, as the sole awardee. Further, the sole awardee and only the sole awardee shall submit its invoice to the Government and receive payment from the Government. <BR> <BR>GSA schedule orders may include "open market" items, i.e., items not on the awardee's list of GSA schedule items, only in compliance with FAR 8.402(f). Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101. In order to notate which items are open market, in accordance with FAR 8.402(f)(3), Seller must write "open market" in the Line Item Description for any item not currently active on the cited contract, or list in the Seller Bid Description field all open market line numbers (e.g. "Open Market Items: Lines 1, 2, 3.") <BR> <BR>Bid prices for EACH line item must be accurate, fair, and reasonable, as determined by the contracting officer, using competitive price comparisons, market research, etc. Bundling multiple line item prices together (?materially unbalanced? pricing) is NOT acceptable, unless that exact bundle is listed as a single CLIN on the bidder?s contract. Any bid may be rejected if the prices for any line items are materially unbalanced. Any bid may be rejected if the contracting officer determines that it is unreasonable as to price. Unreasonableness of price includes not only the total price of the bid, but the prices for individual line items as well. <BR> <BR>

<SUBJECT>M--Modification 4 of Prospectuses at Keller Ferry & Seven Bays Marinas
<SOLNBR>LARO001-13

<CONTACT>Michelle Yates

<DESC>Modification 4 of the solicitation of two Prospectuses to operate marina facilities at Keller Ferry and Seven Bays Marinas within Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area
The National Park Service (NPS) has issued Modification 4 adjusting several elements of the two prospectuses for services at the Keller Ferry and Seven Bays Marinas located within Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area. The two prospectuses are for two different levels of service as well as two different term lengths for the same area and are described below.
- Full service marina operation identified as Full Service Draft Contract includes houseboat and other boat rentals, moorage, retail/grocery, marine fuel and oil sales, pump-out service, and related services. The Full Service Draft Contract is for a term of fifteen (15) years.
- Limited service marina operation identified as Limited Service Draft Contract includes moorage, marine fuel and oil sales, pump-out service, and related services. The Limited Service Draft Contract is for a term of ten (10) years.
The Service is interested in maintaining an appropriate level of service on the south end of Lake Roosevelt and therefore have created the two prospectuses to help facilitate interest in bidding. However, if the Service receives a responsive offer, as that term is defined in 36 C.F.R. Part 51, for the Full Service Draft Contract, regardless of whether the Service receives a responsive offer for the Limited Service Draft Contract, the Service will cancel the Prospectus for the Limited Service Draft Contract before award and select a Concessioner for the Full Service Draft Contract. If the Service only receives a responsive bid to the Limited Service Draft Contract, the Service will select a concessioner for that Contract. In either case the final contract will be awarded under Concession Contract No. CC-LARO001-13.
All Proposals must now be received by the Pacific West Region, Attention: Commercial Services Manager, 333 Bush Street, Suite 500, San Francisco, CA, 94104, no later than 4:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) on April 9, 2013. If you choose to retrieve a copy of the prospectuses from the Service website at http://concessions.nps.gov/prospectuses.htm please notify Kimberley Gagliolo via email at kim_gagliolo@nps.gov so you are placed on the mailing list to receive notifications of any future modifications or other correspondence.

<p>This is a formal Request for Proposal (RFP). NRL is seeking proposals from sources that can provide a nominal 67 HP, 300 VDC submersible motor system consisting of a hydrostatic pressure compensated motor, controller/drive electronics, pressure housing to contain the drive electronics, and hydrostatic pressure tolerant cabling. It is required that the motor drive controller be enclosed in a pressure vessel capable of withstanding hydrostatic pressure ranging from 14 psia to 682 psia. All other equipment, external to the controller/drive electronics pressure housing, shall be capable of operating while withstanding hydrostatic pressure of 14 psia up to 10,014 psia. Electrical connections for power, feedback, and communication\control signals will be provided through appropriate SEACON connectors mounted on the waist of the pressure vessel. Other critical features include its efficiency at low and high power and its weight. The nominal voltage of the system is 300 V. The motor system will employ conductive cooling through the pressure vessel housing to ambient surrounding water. The volume of surrounding water will not have active flow around the pressure housing(s) of the motor or controller. The motor system will be capable of quiet operation and operating at or below the acoustic levels defined in the RFP. Standard MIL-SPECs will be applied for shock, EMI, environmental conditions, etc.</p>

Upon the basis of the following justification, the use of other than full and open competition for the proposed contractual action is hereby approved pursuant to the authority of  41 U.S.C. 253 ( c )(1) and FAR 6.302-1.

The proposed action is for (12) month firm-fixed price (FFP) with an option for four (4) additional years to provide a subscription for "Amputation System of Care" (ACA) training supplies, educational materials, and one year of ACA & "Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities" (CARF) corporate membership for 22 Veteran Integrated Service Networks (VISN) across America. 

Transaction Number/Funding Document 777-13-1-1092-0009 (FY13) funding.________________

1.  Contracting Activity
Department of Veterans Affairs
Veterans Health Administration
Service Area East, Procurement Contracting Activity in St. Louis Contracting
POC:  _Linda Eley___________________, Contracting Officer
11152 South Towne Square
St. Louis, MO 63123
     
2.  Nature of Action Being Approved:  Request a justification and approval for sole source procurement to be issued to Amputation Coalition of America (ACA), 900 East Hill Avenue Suite 205, Knoxville, TN 37915-2568.  

The proposed total contract cost is estimated to be $346,847.00. 
Base Year = $66,847.00
Option Year #1 = $70,000
Option Year #2 = $70,000
Option Year #3 = $70,000
Option Year #4 = $70,000
Estimated Total = $346,847.00

3.  Description of Service and Supplies:  The purpose of the contract is to obtain a subscription for "Amputation System of Care" (ACA) training supplies, educational materials, and one year of ACA & "Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities" (CARF) corporate membership for 22 Veteran Integrated Service Networks (VISN) across America. EES needs access to ACA/CARF corporate membership to support its research for clinical training and education management decisions that directly impact our nation's veteran's quality of healthcare.  This contract is needed to maintain an essential capability that supports studies and clinical education programs for EES customers. ACA will provide educational materials:
"	Membership for 22 VISNs sites
"	Membership for 7 Regional Amputation Centers (RAC) and 15 Polytrauma Amputation Network (PAN) sites
"	100 copies of "First Step" for each of the 22 VISNs; 
"	100 copies of "Side Step" for each of the 22 VISNs; 
"	100 Copies of "Primer Paso" for each of the 22 VISNs
"	50 Copies of "First Step" for each of the 7 Regional Amputation Center (RAC) and the 15 Polytrauma Network (PAN)
"	50 copies of "Side Step" for each of the 7 Regional Amputation Center (RAC) and the 15 Polytrauma Network (PAN)
"	50 Copies of "Primer Paso" for each of the 7 Regional Amputation Center (RAC) and the 15 Polytrauma Network (PAN)
"	55,000 copies of "Pain Brochure" divided across the 7 Regional Amputation Centers (RAC) and 15 Polytrauma Networks (PAN)
"	55,000 copies of "Living Well With Limb Loss" booklet series divided across the 7 Regional Amputation Centers (RAC) and 15 Polytrauma Networks (PAN)

4.  Statutory Authority:  FAR 6.302-1(b) (2) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:  

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  ACA is the only firm that offers the 'Amputation System of Care" training supplies/services, educational materials, and ACA/CARF corporate membership.  The magazines and materials outline experience in providing the required educational training, support materials, as well as the experiences in amputation services which are paramount to the training of our healthcare providers who care for our amputee veterans nationwide.  Also, the approaches outlined in the magazine will permit VA to move from a 'disease model' of care,  into a patient centered 'wellness model'. This approach is also critical in order to provide better amputation care to VHA's continued influx of amputee veterans. The system that is incorporated in ACA's materials will place VA in a unique position of being the best approach to assist VA and its patients in improved "amputation of care".  There are absolutely no other products that will meet VA's needs.  The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes doesn't allow for any other company to provide this information.


6.  Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable: This acquisition will be synopsized on FedBizOpps as required in FAR 5.2041.  The acquisition liaison team conducted market research on Google and through GSA Advantage to identify other sources for this publication and found no other source or commercial items available. Wanakee Strickland (CS) posted a RFI to FedBizOpps on 12/20/2013 and was unsuccessful in obtaining competition. 
7.  Determination of Fair and Reasonable.  The price has been discounted up to 50% from the price offered to preferred customers in the commercial marketplace. For example: trainer memberships for the commercial market place are $150.00, but the government will be receiving the memberships for $75.00.  The ACA/CARF subscription was acquired under purchase order number- 777-C17289 in the amount of $39,975.00 last year with similar costing rates.

8.  Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  Wanakee Strickland (CS) conducted market research using VetBiz.gov, SBA.gov on 12/19/2013 and was unsuccessful in receiving competition. Wanakee Strickland also posted an RFI to FedBizOpps on 12/20/2013 and was unsuccessful in obtaining competition.  The Acquisition Liaison group also searched Google and GSA and was unsuccessful in obtaining competition.
The market research concluded that the publications and materials identified are publications of the Amputation and Coalition and this is copy written materials. There are no other vendors that will be given access to these publications.


9.  Other Interested Sources:  The publications and materials identified are publications of the Amputee Coalition, therefore; no other vendors will be given access to this information.

10.	Future barriers to competition:  Prior to exercising government Option Years, market research will be conducted to determine and validate if any other vendors have come into the marketplace that can meet the needs of the government.

11.	A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  To overcome barriers to future competition for these services, a "Sources Sought" announcement could be placed in the FBO website to verify whether other companies can provide the service requested.

 

























12.  I certify that this justification is complete and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.
