<DESC>The USDA Forest Service, National Forests in Mississippi, is seeking engineering services for the inspection of approximately 85 road bridges. The professional services needed include the inspection and report preparation as required by the National Bridge Inspection Program. The contract will be for one two-year inspection cycle (inspection of all bridges during the winter of 2005-2006 and any interim inspections prior to the next complete set of inspections) with an option to renew for one more two-year cycle beginning with the winter 2007-2008 complete set of inspections. The option cycle will be at the government’s election.

The Forest Service is soliciting the submission of a Standard Form 254 (Architect/Engineer Related Services Questionnaire) and a Standard Form 255 (Architect/Engineer Related Service for Specific Project). Information from the SF-254 and SF-255 will be evaluated according to selection criteria that emphasize ability and experience in conducting bridge inspections according to National Bridge Inspection Program standards. To be considered for this work, a firm must have in its employ an engineer licensed as a registered professional engineer in the State of Mississippi and said engineer will be in responsible charge of all work awarded under this contract. The selection criteria for bridge inspection services are: (a) Professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the required services including the name and relevant experience of the professional engineer in charge of the work; (b) Professional qualifications necessary for the satisfactory performance of the required services including the name, bridge inspection training, and experience of all personnel including any subcontractors involved in the field inspections, ratings, and appraisals, with the role of each clearly stated; (c) Past performance on related contracts in terms of quality of work, compliance with performance schedules, and client satisfaction. A copy of a previously completed bridge inspection report is also required to be submitted; (d) Capacity to accomplish work within the required time. The current number of bridges planned for inspection on each national forest in Mississippi is as follows: De Soto, 44; Bienville, 13; Homochitto, 10; Tombigbee, 10; Delta, 4; Holly Springs, 4. No substantial variation is anticipated, but these numbers may vary slightly over time due to new road construction, decommissioning of roads, land exchanges, changes in road jurisdiction, etc. It is the intent of the Forest Service to award this contract with one cost per bridge inspection regardless of the location of the bridge or the number being inspected. However, the price per inspection may be negotiated at different rates for each cycle. Each bridge inspection must be performed according to National Bridge Inspection Program standards. Some of the bridges to be inspected do not meet the length requirements of NBIS, but are to be treated as if they do. Each bridge inspection team leader must meet the qualifications for that position as stated in the Section 650.309 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Each inspection report shall, at a minimum, contain the following: (a) Forest Service bridge designation (FS road number and milepost); (b) Narrative description of the bridge (location, district, type, year built, road name, waterway crossed, etc.); (c) Narrative description of the inspection procedures; (d) Narrative summary of the inspection results; (e) Channel profile; (f) Narrative discussing additional inspections required, scour susceptibility or problems, and whether more frequent inspections are warranted; (g) List of recommendations (posting, repairs, maintenance, etc.); (h) Completed Structural Inventory and Appraisal Sheet; (i) Completed bridge inspection form; (j) Labeled color photographs of the bridge taken upstream, downstream, and from each approach; (k) Labeled color photograph of each problem identified during the inspection. An individual inspection report is required for each bridge and two copies of each report shall be furnished. Each copy shall have heavy stock front and back covers, secured with one heavy duty staple, and stamped with the seal of the Professional Engineer in charge of the inspection.

The SF-254, SF-255, and sample bridge inspection report are due by CLOSE OF BUSINESS (4:30 PM CT), November 28, 2005. These should be submitted to Anieta McLendon, USDA Forest Service, R8/R9 Western Operations Center, 100 W. Capitol St., Suite 1141, Jackson, MS 39269.  A Selection Board will evaluate each submission and rank them according to the above established Selection Criteria. Contract negotiations will then be initiated with the top ranked firm, proceeding to the next rated firm if necessary, until a mutually satisfactory agreement is achieved. This procurement is open to both large and small business concerns

<SOLNBR>DTFA01-01-C-00011
<RESPDATE>110205
<ARCHDATE>12022005
<CONTACT>Steve Manley, 202-385-8676
<DESC>This purpose of this announcement is to publicize the intent of the FAA to standardize the Airport Surface Detection Equipment - Model X (ASDE-X) configuration currently produced by Sensis Corporation of DeWitt New York.  The FAA proposes that future acquisitions of ASDE-X related equipment be made on a single source basis with Sensis Corporation through fiscal year 2011 in order to accommodate conversion of some ASDE-3 sites to ASDE-3X sites and to facilitate acquisition of ASDE-X equipment for both federal and non-federal entities. The current ASDE-X contract with Sensis Corporation was awarded on October 11, 2000 following a competitive solicitation.  The ASDE-X system consists of a surface movement radar(s), a processor, an ADS-B/multilateration sensor, and displays.  The data from the radar and other sensors is fused together into one target which is displayed to the controllers.  The system provides seamless surveillance coverage of the airport surface and identification (Tags) to air traffic controllers.  The system has been commissioned in Milwaukee, Orlando, Houston, and Providence.     The FAA has recently rebaselined the program resulting in a requirement to purchase ASDE-X material to support converting some ASDE-3 sites to ASDE-3X sites.  The ASDE-3X will enable the ASDE-3 antenna to feed data into the ASDE-X system. In addition, the FAA is developing cost sharing arrangements with various entities, including airlines, who have expressed interest in the ASDE-X system data output for business management purposes and efficiency/cost control benefits.  The FAA will acquire the title to systems purchased through cost sharing arrangements which will  reduce the overall FAA investment in the equipment infrastructure.  Since award of the ASDE-X contract, FAA has invested funding in the program to develop multiple enhancements including safety logic, a data distribution capability, various interfaces to FAA automation systems, and a multiple radar capability.  The safety logic capability has achieved initial operating capability in Orlando.  The multiple radar capability is the sole remaining enhancement to be completed.  In addition, the FAA has invested in specialized software algorithms during the 5 year life of the original contract.         The FAA plans to obtain the maximum life cycle benefit from its investment in the ASDE-X program by standardizing the equipment.  In addition, there are plans to utilize the ASDE-X baseline to support other future capabilities The FAA investment also includes development of training packages, maintenance procedures, logistics support, and technology refreshment plans.     If FAA were to recompete the ASDE-X requirement at the present time, whole new cycles of development, test, documentation, and deployment would likely be required which would include introduction of a different design into the field.  The cost of developing a new baseline and maintaining two system configurations for the same operational requirements would not be beneficical to FAA.  It is beneficial for air traffic controllers and maintenance personnel to be trained on and utilize the same suite of equipment.  The FAA knows of no other company which could provide identical systems without either a substantial initial investment or an extended period of preparation and additional expense to the Government which would duplicate previous investments and logistic support structures already in place.            As the system matures and specific new operational requirements are developed based on experience with the system, it is probable that a competitive requirement would be initiated after FY 2011 which would reflect new FAA requirements.    Accordingly, this is the formal notice to industry that FAA has determined that it is in the best interest of FAA to standardize the ASDE-X equipment being developed by Sensis Corporation through FY 2011.  Future needs of ASDE-X equipment, including FAA requirements and cost/sharing agreements with Federal and non-federal entities will be made with Sensis through FY 2011.  .

PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES 
[DEC 2003] 
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 

“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 

(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
 

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002. 

(g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal. 
(End of provision) 
 
NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date ( if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (CG-851), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011

<ARCHDATE>03092006
<CONTACT>Nancy Landeros 805-989-1880 Nathan Simpson, 805-989-1303
<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, Point Mugu, CA, is soliciting proposals on a full and open, competitive basis to award a cost plus fixed fee contract to perform the efforts required to design, develop, provide, document, install, integrate and test (verify the integration) the aircraft modifications and range instrumentation on three (3) P-3C airframes.  Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 30 (VX-30) currently operates three NP-3D, variant P-3A aircraft out of Pt. Mugu, CA in the performance of the following primary range support mission areas: sea range surveillance and clearance; remote flight termination and command destruct; telemetry data receive, record, relay, and processing; photo and video recording of missile flight and intercepts.  Within the next three years, these aircraft are scheduled to be retired due to the increasing cost of their maintenance, aging aircraft issues, and future sustainability within the Navy inventory.  However, the range s!  upport mission remains, and in fact, has grown in complexity.  Therefore, it is the purpose of this synopsis to call for the design and implement modifications to newer airframes (NP-3C) to continue the mission for a minimum of ten years.  This effort will involve two tasks of different levels of complexity.  The less complex task is the adaptation of existing components and their installations from existing NP-3D airframes to the newer NP-3Cs.  These components are those that accomplish the following: sea range surveillance and clearance; flight termination, safety of flight monitoring and command destruct in UHF-Band; and Optical Airborne Tracking System (Cast Glance), and the GPS Translator Processor (GTP) of the Translated GPS Range System.  Additional instrumentation and installation is required for an encrypted high data rate SATCOM (C & Ku band), and INMARSAT.  The greater level of complexity task is the design and installation of a modernized telemetry suite, includ!  ing antenna(s), receivers, and processors, to accomplish the NP-3C's m ission area of telemetry data receive, record, relay, and processing.   At a high level of complexity, a modernized Advanced Airborne Telemetry System (AATS) shall be capable of tracking and dual polarization telemetry reception of 5 independent targets in S-Band and shall be capable of the same performance for 2 independent targets in L-Band. A successful AATS design will balance initial costs, recurring costs, and performance.  It is anticipated that the antenna design and installation will be the most challenging component of the AATS. Serious consideration should be given to any design's effect on aircraft aerodynamic performance and the impact of airframe structural modifications on the fatigue life of the airframe and the impact to the Fatigue Life Expenditure (FLE) computer models.  It is anticipated the solicitation will be issued on or about 20 November 2005 and will be available at NECO.   Specifications will be available from the contract specialist, Nancy Landero!  s at nancy.landeros@navy.mil phone 805-989-1880.  The specifications will be available concurrent with the issuance of the solicitation.  Foreign access to critical technologies needed for the performance of this contract are not approved for release.  FOCI contractors cannot be permitted access to the information required for full performance of this contract.  When requesting specifications, please provide the company name, company mailing address, company's cage code, company's point of contact and the point of contact’s e-mail address.  No hard copies of the solicitation will be furnished unless absolutely necessary.  The anticipated due date for proposals is 09 January 2006; however the actual proposal date will be stated in the solicitation when issued.   Proposals must be written in English and all costs proposed must be in US dollars.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency. See numbered note 26.

DRDC uniquely represents an official Canadian government/military view of capability to be developed.  The DRDC is a special operating agency within the Canadian Department of National Defence (DND).  As such, they have a unique collaborative relationship with the U.S in defense operations, exemplified by their longstanding cross-border cooperation with NORAD.  In light of this, DTRA plans to develop and leverage systems compatible with both DOD and DND, based on arrangements that could be considered proprietary with an existing contract.

-	Understanding of and countermeasures against chemical and biological threats
-	Understanding of and countermeasures against nuclear and radiological threats
-	Understanding of and mitigation of conventional and novel explosive threats
-	Support for cross-border (US-CA) sharing of information and knowledge management concepts related to the above threats
-	Effective means to predict, analyze, and respond to the above threats when presented individually or in combination, and at single or multiple times and locations.  This will include supporting operational activities, exercises, modeling and simulation activities, demonstrations, and conferences. 

THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS (RFP). The DRDC is the sole provider for these services.  This announcement is for informational purposes only and no formal RFP will be issued.  An Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract is anticipated with an ordering period for five years beginning on or about February 17, 2006 and an option for a second five-year period.

Finalist software is installed on Systems 81, 82, 83 and 84 in the NCC.  Finalist software is a Coding Accuracy Support System certified application that thoroughly prepares addresses for USPS handling.  It is used to verify, standardize, and correct address elements on notices that SSA mails to the public.  The vendor (Group 1, a Pitney Bowes Company), owns all proprietary rights to the software's source code and is the only responsible sole source for maintenance, updates, fixes, along with software upgrades; no other source can maintain the software or provide the relevant software upgrades. The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed purchase order for the maintenance and software license upgrades. Other organizations possessing the requisite expertise and resources are invited to submit information concerning their capabilities, expertise, and other pertinent data. Pricing data may be submitted. Written responses to this synopsis shall contain sufficient documentation to establish a bona fide capability to fulfill this requirement. This is not a request for quotation and the Government does not intend to pay for information received. If SSA does not identify other acceptable sources capable of providing the software maintenance and relevant upgrades, SSA shall issue a sole source award under FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures for the period of 12/01/2005 through 11/30/2006. Responses to this notice should be submitted by November 9th, 2005. Request for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. Oral communications are not acceptable.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES
The Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative is a collaborative effort to harness the power of information technologies to modernize structured learning.  It sets forth a new paradigm to provide access to the highest quality education and training that can be tailored to individual needs and delivered cost-effectively, whenever and wherever it is required.  The ADL Initiative employs a structured, adaptive, collaborative effort between the public and private sectors to develop the standards, tools, and learning content for the future-learning environment.

The ADL Initiative created a network of four ADL Co-Laboratories (ADL Co-Labs) to advance the initiative and to serve distinct areas of operational responsibility.  The ADL Co-Lab Network serves as the focal point and catalyst for the large-scale cooperative research, development, implementation and assessment of ADL technologies and related products.  As a member of that ADL Co-Lab Network, the Joint ADL Co-Lab integrates instruction and technology to meet the military’s training requirements.  It actively pursues research interests to advance the state of distributed learning within the Department of Defense.

PROGRAM SCOPE
The Joint ADL Co-Lab anticipates making multiple awards with the dollar amounts typically ranging from $100,000 to $400,000 for each award.  Offerors may propose on one or more research areas and offerors are encouraged to aggregate two or more research areas in one white paper solution.  Contractors may also Team to propose on research focus areas. The planned method for accomplishing the research in each prospective area is to utilize a phased approach.  Therefore, white papers submitted should be structured so that the technical approach/solution for the proposed research area(s) address a Basic Effort (Phase I) and one (1) priced Option Effort (Phase II).  The white paper must to address at least one of the research areas listed in the BAA and must include the anticipated period of performance, a technical description of the proposed concepts, the technical objectives and a planned approach to accomplish the stated objectives as well as a rough order of magnitude (ROM) cost.  The ROM cost consists of the total cost plus profit/fee, if any. See attached Enclosure.

PHASE I
Phase I will be a 12-month effort and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 - $400,000 per research area.  The effort will culminate in an initial demonstration in the Joint ADL Co-Lab in the fall of 2007.

PHASE II
Phase II will be a 12-month effort and funding may consist of approximately $100,000 - $400,000 per research area.  Final demonstration will be at the Joint ADL Co-Lab in the fall of 2008.

Each white paper must include a statement that the offeror agrees to:

a)	The formal exchange of technical information developed under this effort with Joint ADL Co-Lab personnel, subject to signed non-disclosure agreements and/or Associated Contract Agreements (ASA),
b)	Participation in at least two mandatory technical interchange meetings with Joint ADL Co-Lab personnel, and 
c)	Government purpose rights applying to both technical data and software developed under this effort

WHITE PAPER EVALUATION CRITERIA
White papers will be evaluated by a technical review board using the following criteria listed in descending order of importance:

1.	Scientific and Technical Merit: Proposed efforts should create new, or apply existing technology in a new way, that is advantageous to one or more BAA topics.  The overall scientific and technical merit of the proposal must be clearly identifiable.  The technical concept should be clearly defined and developed.  Emphasis should be placed on the offeror's technical approach through a comprehensive, logical, orderly, concise, phased plan that indicates major milestones, critical paths, key events, capabilities that can be spun off, demonstration articles, etc.  Consideration should be given to the extent which current State-of-the-Art technology is expanded.  Also, innovative teaming arrangements should be taken into consideration.  Offeror should discuss how their concept will be documented, demonstrated, or evaluated, and this discussion should be indicative of the understanding of what is required in this program.  

2.	Potential Contribution to Military Services Needs and Transition to other Programs: The offeror must adequately address how the proposed program will meet the goal of one or more BAA topics.  The proposal must show understanding of the potential alternative approaches and make a compelling case for the viability of the proposed effort.  The relevance is further indicated by the offeror's understanding of the operating environment of the product or demonstration (current Military or Industrial technical problems/issues, limitations, etc.).  The relationships of the proposed effort with other ongoing or anticipated initiatives (military or civilian) that are focused on improving Distributed Learning should be considered.  Offeror should recognize and identify potential strategies for transitioning technology within the DoD.

Contracting Office Address
Department of Labor, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management, Procurement Services Center, N5416 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC, 20210-0001

Description
The U.S. Department of Labor’s, Employee Benefits and Security Administration (EBSA) seeks comment on a DRAFT Statement of Work for a wholly outsourced, turnkey Information Technology (IT) system to be designed, developed, and operated by a private sector vendor under contract to the DOL.  The purpose of the IT system, known as EFAST2, is to receive, process, store, publicly disclose, distribute, and archive approximately 1.1 million electronically filed Form 5500 Series filings submitted annually by the public over the Internet.  Form 5500 Series filings (including Form 5500 and all schedules and attachments to these forms) are annual information returns that contain information on employee benefits plans, including both pension and welfare plans, and are required to be filed annually by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  Form 5500 Series filings may contain Sensitive but Unclassified (SBU) data and are therefore subject to commensurate security and handling protections.  EFAST2 will allow filers to electronically file Form 5500 Series filings via a secure web portal.  The Form 5500 Series electronic filings to be processed include structured data associated with forms and schedules, and unstructured data associated with attachments contained in PDF and text files.  The Department requires this capability to support its vision to mandate electronic filing of Form 5500 returns/reports, per the proposed regulation published in the Federal Register August 30, 2005

This RFP is being issued as a DRAFT for comment purposes only.  At this time the Department estimates that the period of performance for this effort will run from contract award through June 30, 2007 for Based Period (Prototype Development), July 1, 2007 through June 30,2008 for Option Period I (Production Scale-up), and July 1, 2008 through June 30 2018 for Option Periods II-XI (Operations). EBSA seeks comments on the DRAFT RFP from firms that are capable of performing the work described in the DRAFT RFP, which can be summarized as follows: 1) Designing, developing, hosting, and maintaining a secure, scaleable web portal that allows users to electronically file Form Series 5500 filings; 2) Providing a system based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) allowing filers to submit filings directly through the website or via approved third party software; 3) Checking all filings for accuracy and completeness using XML schema validation and edit tests, and quickly returning acceptance/rejection messages to the filer via email; 4) Allowing stakeholders such as plan administrators, plan transmitters, and software developers to electronically register and attain electronic filing credentials. The system would verify these credentials upon receipt of each filing; 5) Providing a public disclosure website that allows the public, Government, and vendor contact center staff to access, view, and download filing facsimiles over the Internet; 6) Providing a contact center and related customer support features to filers, software developers, and other stakeholders interfacing with the system; 7) Providing support to third party software developers that develop electronic filing software with which filers may complete, validate, and submit filings electronically.  This support would include electronic filing technical specifications, technical support, testing, certification, and other ongoing support; 8) Managing all IT and related telecommunications equipment associated with the web portal; 9) Establishing and maintaining all required security on the portal based on varying degrees of access control and authorization, as well as physical, personnel, administrative, and computer security for the filing data, processing facility, and staff, including supporting Government conduct of a Minimum Background Investigation (MBI) for each assigned staff member; 10) Establishing an end-to-end tracking function that records the processing history and current status of all filing submissions received; and 11) Meeting or exceeding the contractually specified timeliness and accuracy performance standards specified in the solicitation.  Please refer to the DRAFT RFP for additional information on the contractual terms and conditions, performance standards, functional, security, and other related requirements.  

Comments on this DRAFT RFP will be accepted via E-mail to mailto:EFAST2@dol.gov, but to be considered, comments must be received by November 30, 2005 2:00 p.m. eastern standard time.  This E-mail address is for receipt of comments only and shall not be used for any other correspondence.  Comments should clearly identify the name of the firm, contact information, and the specific section(s) of the DRAFT RFP referenced by the comment(s). All firms/organizations that submit comments will be included in the distribution of any subsequent solicitation. 

The Department is concurrently conducting market research in an effort to identify small businesses that are capable of performing the work described in the DRAFT RFP.  Accordingly, small businesses capable of performing the work described in the DRAFT RFP are encouraged to submit a brief corporate capability statement, including the identification and type of small business that you are (i.e., Women-Owned, Small Disadvantaged, Veteran-Owned, etc.).    The NAICS Code identified for this requirement is 541512 with a size standard of $21,000,000.

This sources sought notice (i.e., RFI) is being issued for planning purposes only and does not commit the Government to pay for the information requested, issue a solicitation, or award a contract. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AT THIS TIME.  NO PROPOSALS SHALL BE ENTERTAINED BASED ON THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.   Furthermore, the attached technical sections do not constitute a complete RFP or imply that a complete RFP will be submitted at a later date.   No legal liability on the part of the Government exists for payment of any money for the performance of work requested by this sources sought notice. The Government will take into consideration all comments issued by the above deadline. Based on the comments and capability statements that the Government receives for this sources sought notice, the Government may issue a final RFP at later date.

6.	PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	Two years (renewable) 
7.	PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:		USAID/CENTRAL ASIA, Almaty, Kazakhstan 
8.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A)	BACKGROUND

USAID/CAR Background: Central Asia Borders Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its location amidst these neighbors and its substantial oil and gas reserves, Central Asia is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million and dozens of ethnic groups the five new nations of the region are emerging from isolation and almost two centuries of Russian domination. A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions makes Central Asia a particular challenge for USAID.  

The Regional Mission for Central Asia (USAID/CAR) is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. ambassadors in the region, for the strategic planning, program design and implementation, achievement of results, and reporting for the USAID assistance programs for the five Central Asian republics.  The USAID Regional Mission for Central Asian Republics is headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, with country offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek and Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  The U.S. Government’s program of assistance in the region is focused on the growth of small-scale enterprise and trade; building a more open, democratic culture; better management of environmental resources; and improved primary healthcare.  It ranks as one of the Agency’s largest programs, with funding levels that have averaged over $139 million annually.  The Mission works in partnership with over 80 grantee and contractor teams.  USAID/CAR’s assistance seeks to mitigate conflict and expand opportunities for participation, livelihood and quality of life for the citizens of the Central Asian Republics.  Staff frequently travels to each of the five countries to manage and monitor development assistance. 
 
USAID/CAR has program responsibility for the formulation of assistance strategy and management approaches to support reforms in the energy systems of five countries in this region.  A major component of the CAR energy programs focuses on market development and regional cooperation in sharing of water and energy resources.  The majority of the current work is related to the power sector, and involves cross-border hydro-power resources and operation of large grids.

After relative isolation and stagnation in the 1990s, this sector has begun to attract significant foreign investments to develop and access vast energy resources for supplying the outside markets.  In addition, Kazakhstan has undergoing substantial reforms and privatization, and is experiencing rapid growth.  These trends offer opportunities to modernize this sector by developing internal and external markets, and by integrating with larger outside grids.  Increased commercialization and market developments are expected to expand trade and investments, while promoting transparency, governance, rule of law and checking corruption.

Based in USAID/Almaty, the Energy Policy Advisor will lead in the design, implementation, and coordination of USAID financed activities in CAR dealing with energy policy and market reforms.  The purpose of this work is to prepare the CAR systems for closer cooperation, support a framework for operation and development of cross-border water and energy resources, and to improve the performance of this sector.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6M.

This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can provide access to data on health care practitioner prescribing practices including, but not limited to, patient demographics and indications for treatment in the outpatient setting.  FDA requires access to such data to obtain national estimates or counts.

The overall data characteristics provided shall include:  the number of health care practitioners (e.g., physicians, physician’s assistants, nurse practitioners, dentists), visits, and patients; characterization of individual health care practitioners in terms of number, specialty, practice setting, age, gender, geographic region and U.S. Census region.  Additionally, potential offerors shall provide a characterization of the practice setting of health care practitioners in terms of type of facility (e.g., surgi-centers, staff model HMOs, clinics), geographic region and U.S. Census region (desired, but not required).  Where possible, potential offerors shall provide a comparison to national figures.

The data resource shall be accessible via a secure Internet or network-based method.  Potential offerors shall provide the following:  a method of access for examining visit-level prescribing data for products linked to clinical or medical data on indication shall be specified in detail; a method of access for examining data on visits for specified diseases or medical conditions, and associated treatments, if any; the ability to capture all drugs prescribed to treat the same diagnosis as well as all drugs mentioned during the visit regardless of diagnosis; interface documentation (e.g., white paper, training manual) the ability to receive e-mail confirmation when reports are complete, if applicable; a method and frequency for updating interface; a method of simultaneous, multi-user access; a past history of scheduled and unscheduled downtime of data; and the number and nature of limits to access, including numbers of users, numbers and types of data elements.

Technical Requirements and Capabilities
A.	The patient-level and/or visit-level data shall be a currently existing, commercially available, HIPAA-compliant product that shall provide immediate automated access with the capability of providing characterization of health care practitioner prescribing practices including but not limited to patient demographics, and indications for treatment in the outpatient setting.
B.	The data shall be a currently existing, commercially available, HIPAA-compliant product that shall provide immediate automated access with the capability of providing both current and historical national-level prescribing practice information. 
C.	Access to the data shall be immediate, unlimited, direct, desktop and in real-time.  Access shall include all upgrades, enhancements, and modifications to software and data. 
D.	Access shall be via secure Internet or network-based methods and shall be in a multi-user environment. The network-based methods shall not necessitate any additions to the FDA communications infrastructure.  FDA shall not support modem-based or dial-up access.  Additionally, FDA shall not support or maintain potential offerors’s equipment or personnel on premises.
E.	Potential offerors shall provide documentation addressing the stability of their business contracts or agreements with their data suppliers over the course of this proposed contract with the FDA.
F.	In the event of changes to the potential offerors’ business contracts or agreements with their data suppliers, FDA shall be notified within 5 business days of the potential offerors becoming aware of such changes, detailing the impact of these changes on data quality, data quantity, and overall data characteristics.
G.	Access shall be through an interface and this interface shall be user-friendly, transparent and flexible enough to meet the FDA’s needs.  Minimally, the interface shall provide both predefined (e.g., canned) and custom reports.
H.	FDA requires the ability to make national estimates of visit-based and/or patient-based outpatient health care practitioner prescribing practices using a mutually agreed upon projection or other appropriate methodologies, which shall be valid, reliable, and robust with regard to prescribing practices specifically, and the methods fully disclosed.  If such methodology has not been developed, a commitment in the form of a detailed development plan, strategic outline and timeline to collaborate with FDA investigators to develop and implement a mutually acceptable method for making national estimates within 6 months shall be provided as part of the written technical proposal.  
I.	Full disclosure of data collection and projection methodology and a complete, up-to-date data dictionary shall be required as part of the technical proposal to allow FDA staff to appropriately evaluate and interpret the data and its source.

M.	As part of its regulatory activities, FDA will, at times, require disclosure of scientific and technical articles, study results, presentations, public health advisories, and similar works involving summarized data to entities outside the Agency including the general public.  Any proposed disclosure policy shall include a provision that with the expiration of the contract, the potential offeror shall continue processing clearance requests on data that was obtained during the contract period.  This provision accounts for the time involved in the evaluation of a drug safety issue, i.e. data extraction, analyses, and formulation of a regulatory position. Any proposed disclosure policy documentation shall be provided with the submission of the potential offerors proposal and will require FDA legal review and approval upon award of contract.
N.	A proposed process shall be provided for allowing FDA to share project specific summarized or raw data with third parties for collaborative research projects of public health importance that are initiated by and for the benefit of FDA.  This process shall allow FDA to share data in a timely manner.  Any third party non-disclosure documentation shall be provided with the submission of the Potential offerors's proposal and will require FDA legal review and approval upon award of contract 
O.	Post-award training of FDA staff and written documentation related to using the data shall be required.  Training for users of the data, as well as training for FDA personnel who will support use of the data (e.g., technical users) shall also be required.  Potential offerors shall provide course outlines for all levels of training and the number of sessions offered, including at least one annual training session offered on site at FDA and options for additional “on-demand” sessions either in person or via web-based methods.

During this short-term trial access period, the FDA shall only use the data for the purposes of evaluation of the data.  FDA shall not use the data, nor any analyses derived from the data, for public disclosure or regulatory decision-making.  The Potential offerors shall provide a fully executed Trial Subscription Agreement (Attachment 1) with the submission of the Potential offerors's technical proposal.  
R.	FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as the means to access the data.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. Responses to this publication are solicited to identify qualified sources. This is not a request for a formal proposal.  The anticipated NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541990 with a size standard of $6M.

This synopsis seeks to identify contractors that can provide access to data representing pharmaceutical sales, promotional, and advertising strategies at a national level in the U.S.  

The pharmaceutical sales data shall include but is not limited to sales to retail pharmacies, mail order houses, long-term care facilities, non-federal hospitals, federal facilities, clinics, home healthcare settings specialty pharmacies, and other types of pharmacies, if available.  The type of sales data captured shall include both volume and dollar sales. Volume shall include measures of weight (i.e. kilograms, conversion factors to permit calculation of weight of active ingredient); counts of packages (i.e. shipping units, shelf keeping units); and counts of standard dosages (i.e., tablets/milliliters).  Dollar sales shall include the amount of money spent on a product acquired from manufacturers and drug wholesalers by retail pharmacies, mail-order houses, long-term care facilities, non-federal hospitals, federal facilities, clinics, home healthcare settings specialty pharmacies, and other types of pharmacies.  Available price measures should be as broad as possible and include a minimum of exit manufacturer prices, wholesale acquisition cost and average retail price measures along with details of computation.  The pharmaceutical promotional and advertising data shall include but is not limited to expenditures for promotional contacts to office- and hospital-based physicians; product samples to office-based physicians; product advertising in medical journals; and direct-to-consumer advertising. Direct access to these data in real time enhances and accelerates the pace of FDA's regulatory decision-making process.

The statutory provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as amended by the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA, Section 406), Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 310.305, and Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 314.80 require FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of regulated marketed products. Access to data on pharmaceutical sales, promotional and advertising data would help FDA to respond expeditiously to serious public health or regulatory issues. 

FDA is not interested in developing this database and expects any qualified organization to own the data as well as the means to access the data. 

FDA Requirements: 

A.	Provide FDA personnel with real-time, unlimited, immediate, direct, multi-user, desktop access to currently existing, commercially available, data with the capability of providing national-level estimates of pharmaceutical sales.

<CONTACT>David Etro, Contract Specialist, (973)724-3975
<DESC>The U.S. Army Office of the Project Manager Close Combat Systems (OPMCCS),  Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000 is conducting a market survey to identify  potential sources to fabricate, test and deliver up to a quantity of 9-14 each  XM-7 Spider Munitions (Networked commanded anti-personnel systems) over a  thirty (30) month period of time.  In addition, the Government will  contemplate a follow-on contract action in FY07 for additional Spider system  quantities (250-280) that would add approximately an additional six (6) months  to the period of performance. The Spider system will meet the President's Anti -Personnel Landmine (APL) policy with regards to Non-Self-Destruct/Self -Destruct APL.  Spider is a stand-alone weapon system consisting of three main hardware  components: a Remote Control Station (RCS), a Repeater for extended  communications, and a Munition Control Unit (MCU), each capable of containing  up to six individual miniature grenades.  Spider will be compatible with the  U.S. Army battlefield key management infrastructure and the Navy Electronic  Key Management System (EKMS).  Spider must meet the COMSEC and Transmission  Security (TRANSEC) requirements contained in the Spider Security Policy.   Spider will use removable media compatible with the Force XXI Battle Command  Battalion/Brigade and Below (FBCB2), an indirect interface. Since these systems are to fulfill current requirements, the contractor must be  able to meet an expedited delivery schedule. There is urgency in completing  the Spider production and fielding as many systems as possible to fill the  operational capability void that will exist after 31 December 2010, the date  that the US will no longer utilize persistent landmines.  In addition, the Feb  04 Presidential policy on landmines established a 2008 IOC fielding date for  Spider.  In order to meet the FY08 IOC date, it is required to procure and  field required quantities using the programs developed LRIP manufacturing  line.  Thus the completion of LRIP within 33 months allotted is critical to  allow enough time to produce and deliver the LRIP and FRP quantity to meet the  above dates. It is the intention of the Government to award on a sole source basis to the  joint venture team of Textron Systems, Wilmington, MA and Alliant Techsystems,  Plymouth, MN, who is the current contractor of the XM-7 Spider system. They  have the necessary equipment and skills to produce these systems to meet our  delivery schedule requirements. The XM-7 Spider system is built to a  performance specification, the Government does not have a mature Technical  Data Package, and some of the electronics in the munition payload are  proprietary to the joint venture companies. This market survey is for  information and planning purposes only, does not constitute a Request for  Proposal (RFP), and is not to be construed as a commitment by the U.S.  Government. The Government implies no intention or opportunity to acquire  funding to support current or future production efforts. If a formal  solicitation is generated at a later date, a solicitation notice will be  published. No award will made as a result of this market survey. All  information is to be submitted at no cost or obligation to the Government. The  Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private  sector input as a result of this market survey.  The Government is not obligated to notify respondents of the results of this  survey.

<SUBJECT>A -- Innovative Deposition Technologies for Solar and Other Thin-Film Applications
<DESC>Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking one or more industrial partners to assist in advancing and commercializing LANL's Ion Beam Assisted Deposition (IBAD) and Polymer Assisted Deposition (PAD) technologies for solar and other thin-film applications. 

Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research & Development Agreements (CRADA) and/or commercial licenses. Commercial licensees will have the option to obtain, up to and including, a non-exclusive license to the intellectual property in a pre-negotiated, defined field of use for reasonable compensation. CRADAs are expected to include funds-in to the Lab.

LANL’s IBAD technology includes methods for depositing biaxially-oriented (aligned) oxides on a variety of substrates, as well as the growth of well-oriented quality silicon films on polycrystalline templates. A wide range of substrates and semiconductor materials can be produced with these methods, allowing for innovative performance designs and manufacturing flexibility with cost savings. 

LANL’s PAD technology includes methods for producing quality thin films of metal oxides on substrates using polymers as the solvent. Because no vacuum equipment is required this technology is cheaper than chemical vapor deposition. PAD has also shown better resistance to cracking than conventional “sol-gel” methods. LANL has demonstrated this technique with a variety of metal oxides and believes the same technique could be used with nitrides, sulfides, and carbides for lower-cost, higher-performance materials.

Reference is made to the Department of Defense (DoD) Public-Private Competition of Information Management (IM) Information Technology (IT), under Office of Management a nd Budget (OMB) Circular A-76, which closed on October 21, 2005.

The USACE MEO evaluated all interested Army Information Technology Enterprise Solutions (ITES) and General Services Administration Millennia contractors.  The USACE MEO then sol icited technical and cost information from those determined capable of performing all required work.  As a result of this evaluation, the USACE MEO selected Lockheed Martin as its subcontractor to develop the MEO Agency Tender.  After selection of Lockheed  Martin, an Agency Tender was developed with the USACE MEO at Lockheeds own expense.  The USACE MEO now intends to award a sole source contract on the basis of RFP W912HZ-06-R-0001 under FAR 6.302-1.   The work to be performed under this contract consists  of fixed price services for IMIT Administration and Management, Automation Services and Systems Support, Communications Services and Systems Support, and Information Assurance Services and Support.

These services are required nationwide. The USACE MEO is unaware of any other contractor that can be prepared by December 12, 2005 (the Agencys current published performance decision date) to provide the required services to perform this work.

All costs associated with development of this SOW will be at the expense of the contractor.  Interested firms must be ready to provi de the required services to perform the work by December 12, 2005.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  Interested parties may identify their interest and submit technical information and a technical capability statement in r esponse to this notice.

(4) If an emergency or unanticipated event interrupts normal Government processes so that offers cannot be received at the Government office designed for receipt of offers by the exact time specified in the solicitation, and urgent Government requirements preclude amendment of the solicitation or other notice of an extension of the closing date, the time specified for receipt of offers will be deemed to be extended to the same time of day specified in the solicitation on the first work day on which normal Government processes resume. 		(5) Offers may be withdrawn by written notice received at any time before the exact time set for receipt of offers.  Oral offers in response to oral solicitations may be withdrawn orally.

(g) Contract award (not applicable to Invitation for Bids).  The Government intends to evaluate offers and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Therefore, the offeror's initial offer should contain the offeror's best terms from a price and technical standpoint.

The Government may reject any or all offers if such action is in the public interest; accept other than the lowest offer; and waive informalities and minor irregularities in offers received.

HSAR 3052-70, PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTS WITH CORPORATE EXPATRIATES [DEC 2003]   [Full Text Follows]
(a) Prohibitions. 
Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause:  "Expanded Affiliated Group" means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting 'more than 50 percent' for 'at least 80 percent' each place it appears.  "Foreign Incorporated Entity" means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
"Inverted Domestic Corporation." A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership;  (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held-  (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and  (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.  "Person", "domestic", and "foreign" have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.  (1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership:  (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296.  (2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.  (3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership.  (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows:  (i) warrants;  (ii) options;  (iii) contracts to acquire stock;  (iv) convertible debt instruments; and (v) others similar interests.  (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835.  (f) Disclosure.  By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107- 296 of November 25, 2002.  (g) If a waiver has been granted, a copy of the approved waiver shall be attached to the bid or proposal.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. 
The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), 
except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 
“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
“Inverted Domestic Corporation.” A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
(1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
(2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held— 
(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. 
(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section. 
(d) Special Rule For Related Partnerships. For purposes of applying Section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 
(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

1.	Overall Objectives

The overall objective of this project is to increase the availability of water in Gode, Ethiopia; through identifying and surveying candidate sites for the drilling of water wells, or through identifying and evaluating alternate means of water collection and distribution.   

The objective of this contract is to investigate water sources for the town of Gode, in the Somali regional state of Ethiopia.

2.	Contractor Responsibilities

In order to conduct a comprehensive water source investigation, the consultant will perform the following:     

a.	Collect, collate and analyze all available geological and hydro-geological maps and reports of the areas and carry out preliminary geological and hydro-geological interpretations. 

b.	Conduct site investigations on existing water supply sources and, based on the interpretive base maps, assess the availability, type and depth of potential aquifers. 

c.	Identify prospective areas for groundwater exploitation and define the geometry of the aquifers by way of appropriate geophysical methods (e.g., through vertical electrical sounding (VES) methods using Schlumberger array). 

d.	Based on the geological, hydro-geological, geomorphological and geophysical data synthesis, select optimum sites for exploration/exploitation drilling. 

e.	Investigate the prospects for alternative water supply schemes (e.g., rainwater collection) and compare the sustainability of each in contrast with the drilling option. 

f.	In prioritizing and selecting one or more water supply schemes, consult with and consider the traditional judgments and feelings of the local beneficiaries – particularly the women in the community.   

g.	If surface water harvesting is seen as the best option, assess the type and extent of locally available construction materials. 

h.	If deep or shallow drilling is proposed, assess the technical difficulties that could be encountered during drilling and the recommended drilling methods. 

i.	Prepare preliminary designs, bills of materials and cost estimates for the development of the water schemes.

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. This agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protestor fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:


                         Commandant (G-85)
