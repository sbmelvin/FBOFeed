<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with FEI Company in Hillsboro, OR to furnish, deliver, and install a new Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM), Model Quanta 200 Field Emission Gun (FEG) System, Components and Accessories and a Trade-In to the USDA, ARS, NAA, Eastern Regional Research Center (ERRC) located in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania.  This requirement is pending funds availability.  The scientific staff of the Eastern Regional Research Center requires a modern Environment Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) with a documented reputation and published record and proven capabilities of providing secondary electron images of a broad range of natural and processed agricultural, biological and microbiological materials, such as those included within the subject areas of the formal research programs of the Agricultural Research Service.  The microscope must be capable of providing the highest possible spatial resolution of topographical sample features by secondary electron imaging at atmospheric pressures allowing the samples to remain fully hydrated, with the water vapor associated and in equilibrium with the natural water in the sample serving as the gas in the specimen chamber during imaging.  The microscope must also have the capability of providing extremely high spatial resolution of sample features under conventional high vacuum conditions for conventional high resolution imaging.  The integral secondary electron detector is the most important detector used for ERRC imaging applications; the resolution of this detector should be near 2.0 nm at high accelerating voltages in the three modes of microscope operation:  (1) high vacuum mode, (2) low vacuum mode and (3) high pressure mode.  Also, for studies of superficial structural features at low accelerating voltages (~3kV), the spatial resolution must be less than 3.5 nm.  For integrated imaging applications, the microscope must be capable of low magnification (~15X) at long working distances and less than 60X magnification at working distances that provide for the highest spatial resolution, laterally.  The unique qualification of the FEI Inc. Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) is the capability of high resolution imaging through an integral and patented secondary electron detector technology and vacuum system for imaging fully hydrated agricultural materials, as well as providing the technology for extremely high resolution under conventional high vacuum  conditions.  The Quanta 200 FEG system and components complies with U.S. electromagnetic compatibility regulations and manufactured to CE Standards.  The system includes:  An Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM), model Quanta 200 FEG (Field Emission Gun) with a 50 x 50 mm, 5 axis specimen stage, 4 axes motorized, including the following components and conditions:  a. Host support computer with MS Windows Graphical User Interface.  b. Computer controlled Peltier stage for Quanta 200/400.  c. Feedthrough and cooler for Peltier (or heating) stage.  d. Manual user interface USB.  e. 0nline database access software.  f. Docu B- license.  g. Specimen holder kit.  h. A gaseous back-scatter detector for BSE imaging under wet conditions.  i. GAD low-kV, solid state, back scattered electron detector.  j. An ESEM wide angle option for increased field-of-view at high specimen chamber pressures.   k. Compressor, 115 V, 50/60 Hz (if necessary).  l. Liquid coolant cooled water chiller for Quanta FEG ESEM.  m. Tabletop with supports.  n. HP230 Photosmart printer.  o.  All standard inclusive items for operation of the Quanta 200 FEG for intended purposes.  The Contractor shall perform a pre-shipment room survey.

(b) Any information technology provided, operated and/or maintained under this contract is required to be Year 2000 compliant.  To ensure this result, the Contractor shall provide documentation describing how the IT items or services demonstrate Year 2000 compliance, consisting of: standard product literature or test reports.  (c) The Contractor warrants that any IT or service under this contract that involve the processing of date and date-related data are Year 2000 compliant.  If the contract requires that specific listed products must perform as a system in accordance with the foregoing warranty, then the warranty shall apply to those listed products as a system.  d) The remedies available under this warranty shall include repair or replacement, at no additional cost to the Government, of any provided items or service whose non-compliance is discovered and made known to the contractor in writing within 90 days after acceptance.  In addition, all other terms and limitation of the Contractor's standard commercial warranty or warranties shall be available to the Government for the IT items or services acquired under this contract.

DFAR 252.204-7004, (NOV 2001), Required Central Contractor Registration,  (a) Definitions. As used in this clause   (1) Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database means the primary DOD repository for contractor information required for the conduct of business with DOD. (2) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet Information Services to identify unique business entities. (3) Data Universal Numbering System +4 (Duns+4) number means the Duns number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet plus a 4-digit suffix that may be assigned by a parent (controlling) business concern. This 4 digit suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the parent business concern for such purposes as identifying subunits or affiliates of the parent business concern. (4) Registered in the CCR database means that all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the Duns +4 number, if applicable, and the corresponding Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code, is in the CCR database; the DUNS number and the CAGE code have been validated; and all edits have been successfully completed. (b) (1) By submission of an offer, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the CCR database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from this solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States. (2) The offeror shall provide its DUNS or, if applicable, its DUNS +4 number with its offer, which will be used by the Contracting Officer to verify that the offeror is registered in the CCR database. (3) Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award. (4) DOD has established a goal of registering an applicant in the CCR database within 48 hours after receipt of a complete and accurate application via the Internet. However, registration of an applicant submitting an application through a method other than the Internet may take up to 30 days. Therefore, offerors that are not registered should consider applying for registration immediately upon receipt of this solicitation. (c) The contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the CCR, and for any liability resulting from the Government’s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the contractor is required to confirm on an annual basis that its information in the CCR database is accurate and complete. (d) Offerors and contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-888-227-2423, or via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov. 
This solicitation is only open to all small business concerns within the Norfolk commuting area.  This area known as Tidewater / Hampton Roads is defined as extending as far north as Williamsburg, as far south as the Chesapeake-North Carolina border, as far west as Suffolk, and is bordered on the east by the Atlantic ocean, Chesapeake Bay, and York River.  This solicitation geographical limitation is essential for limiting possible financial impacts upon the Contractor and the Government; due to the need for Ship / Contractor pre-performance conferences and due to unforeseeable ship schedule changes during contract performance.  Offerors’ geographical locations will be verified by information in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.   Offerors may schedule an opportunity to scope the task through direct contact with the ship or activity without contacting the Contracting Officer.  Visitations shall be at contractor’s own expense and no pre-paid open-and-inspection costs are authorized.  POC:  SKC Pamela Nelson pamelan@roosevelt.navy.mil
