<DESC>This requirement originally appeared in the Commerce Business Daily printed edition on November 8, 2000, and in the CBDNet on-line edition on November 3, 2000.  For this acquisition the small business size standard is 750 employees and the NAICS code is 335313. This project had been delayed due to lack of funding, but is now going forward.  The Bureau of Reclamation's Grand Coulee Project, Grand Coulee, WA, has a requirement to: remove eight 115-kV power circuit breakers;  furnish, install, and test six 115-kV circuit breakers; furnish one gas transfer cart; furnish, install and test four 115-kV coupling capacitor voltage transformers; modify one control and relay duplex switchboard; and, design, fabricate and install steel supports for coupling capacitor voltage transformer and control and relay duplex switchyard sections.  Reclamation will issue this Request for Proposals (RFP) in the Adobe Acrobat PDF format via CDROM within 60 days of this 2nd announcement.  Due to the delay in the issuance of the RFP, interested offerors will need to register to receive a copy of the RFP via our website at http://www.usbr.gov/pn/contracts.  A bidders/planholders list of offerors who've expressed interest in the requirement will be posted on the website when the RFP is issued.  Offerors who responded to the original CBD announcement will need to re-register due to changes in Reclamation's security policies regarding procurements at this facility.  No hard copies or faxed copies of the planholder list will be provided.  All dates are subject to change.  Offers will be evaluated on their proposed breakers and other equipment, their past performance, the quality and capabilities of their proposed manufacturing facilities, their draft CPM schedule, and price.  At this time, a site visit has not been scheduled but the RFP, when issued, will include the specific date, time, security procedures, and meeting location for the site visit as well as providing a contact point for the site visit. This requirement is not set-aside for small business.  See Numbered Notes 12 and 26.

<DESC>NASA/LaRC has a requirement for space flight Universal Source Encoder for Space radiation hardened application specific integrated circuits (ASICS).  The ASICS will run Rice algorithms.  The Rice algorithm runs 15 data compression algorithms in parallel and selects the most efficient out of the 15 for a greater than 2 to 1 lossless compression ratio.  QML-V (Class-S) processing will be used in the ASIC fabrication process and total dose characteristics will be verified to 100K Rads (Si).   NASA/LaRC intends to purchase the items from ICS as the only known source who can meet agency requirements.  This procurement is required in support of the Geosynchronous Infrared Fourier Transform Spectrometer (GIFTS) instrument.  GIFTS is a measurement concept which combines a number of advanced technologies, including particularly the Large area format Focal Plane detector Array (LFPA) with the Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS).  The GIFTS will improve the observation of all three basic atmospheric state variables (temperature, moisture, and wind velocity) allowing much higher spatial, vertical, and temporal resolutions than is now achievable with currently operational geostationary weather satellites.  ASICS from other sources are not acceptable because they do not have proven reliability in the space radiation environment (100K Rads [Si] in a 7-year geosynchronous orbit).   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 10, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

NASA/MSFC intends to purchase CFX-4 to CFX-5 Upgrade and License Maintenance from ANSYS, Inc., pursuant to FAR 6.302-1, which implements the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  Competition is impractical because: The CFX code has the unique capabilities and features required to analyze the variety of fluid dynamic flows associated with the Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) systems being tested at NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and at other NASA facilities.

This capability will greatly enhance the ground systems testing and analysis to encompass on-orbit systems.  The CFX code has been proven to be user friendly and has produced results that correlated well with CFM 0-G test data.  The maintenance for CFX will provide software updates and program support.  ANSYS, Inc. is the only supplier of the CFX code and maintenance services; no other supplier exists. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).

(b) There is a tight schedule for this project and limited windows of opportunity for testing at MSFC  bringing in someone new and obtaining the necessary laser training and certification, as well as familiarizing them with the project, would introduce delays to the schedule.  No one else but Dr. Wehrmeyer has the existing knowledge of this project and the expertise required to effectively complete the tasks outlined in the contract within the contract period. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 3:00 p.m. Central Standard Time on July 14, 2003.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>MULTICELL AND DISMOUNT COMMAND AND CONTROL, SOL BAA 03-33, DUE:  08/14/03; POC: MR. GARY SAUER, DARPA/IXO; FAX: (571) 218-4550. Background:  This BAA is structured to specifically support the mission of the execution of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) Future Combat System Command and Control (FCS C2) Program. The FCS C2 program is a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) led effort, with the cooperation of the U.S. Army CommunicationsElectronics Command (CECOM) Research and Development Center (RDEC). The focus of this effort is to expand upon the research effort of the Future Combat Systems Command and Control (FCS C2) Program to determine the next level of requirements, C2 functions and information profiles/flows for FCS Unit Higher Headquarters, Multiple FCS Units Command and Control, Dismounted Soldier and Dismounted Commander Operations.  The research to date has built a prototype C2 system which integrates previously stove-piped Battle Command operating systems/functions into a single tailorable display for decision-making.  The supporting Command and Control Experimental Demonstration System developed in the FCS C2 Program will be extended to support this expanded research in determining the technical challenges in Battle Command for Multiple FCS Unit interactions, Higher Headquarters Command and Control, and Dismounted soldiers as a subsystem to the FCS Family of Systems design. The current command and control system experimental demonstrator (prototype) for the FCS Unit already illustrates the potential for a significantly reduced staff to control and employ its organic assets within the unit. In addition to minimizing supporting staff, an important part in expanding this research effort will be to assess whether the system under test is scaleable to other FCS echelons and joint task force elements to facilitate future C2 with multiple Battle Command functions integrated into a single Battle Command System to empower the decision-maker with information to understand current and future states while reducing uncertainty. The FCS C2 program had several distinct components:  The Integrated C2 Systems and Operational Architecture, the development of a simulation federation to stimulate the C2 prototype, a supporting Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) lab and the development of the C2 prototype.  The program began with a Start-up initiative (Phase I), followed by an FCS C2 Architecture Study initiative (Phase II) and the FCS C2 development and Experimentation initiatives (Phase III).  Phase IV of the FCS C2 program is the subject of this request and includes continued FCS C2 development/maturation and Experimentation in support of Multicell and Dismounted C2 capabilities. FCS C2 Start-up phase (Phase I). The start-up phase (October 2000 - January 2001) consisted of the preparation of program plans, personnel recruitment, and contracts. FCS C2 Study (Phase II). The FCS C2 Study was a two-phased effort, the first of which was a 10-month effort to initially investigate and document the following: An operational and systems architecture for the C2 Prototype, developed in accordance with version 3.1 of the Joint Technical Architecture (JTA) Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Framework 2.0 (December 1997). This framework is a standard adopted by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) community for developing systems architectures. The FCS C2 Study or Technical Team published their initial report, Future Combat System (FCS) Unit Cell C2 Architecture Study, Interim Report in January 2002. This report was leveraged to execute the experimentation effort in phase 3. The second phase, which concluded in April of FY03, involved refining and updating the results of the first phase. FCS C2 Program Organization. To build the C2 Prototype, DARPA and the CECOM RDEC formed three teams: a Technical Team, an Operational Team, and an Experimentation Team. The Technical Team consisted of personnel from academia, the Army, and industry. This team was primarily focused on the FCS C2 Study effort described above, to include making subsequent refinements and updates to maintain its accuracy and applicability to program goals.  The Operational Team was mentored by senior level active duty and/or retired military personnel and consisted of several School of Advanced Military Studies (SAMS) graduates with positional experience throughout the U.S. Army's Forces Command (FORSCOM) and the Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC). This team was primarily focused on developing the Unit Cells operational information flows, its experimental force structure, and the Doctrine, Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (DTTP) used in each experiment. The Experimentation Team included a team of human performance scientists from the Army Research Institute (ARI) and was primarily focused on developing the C2 Prototype, the FCS C2 Simulation Federation, and the overall plan to test the projects hypothesis.  This program organization, to include the general roles/responsibilities discussed above, will be maintained throughout the duration of the support Multicell/Dismounted C2 effort. The C2 Prototype (Phase III).Vision: Provide information to the operator such that the user is informed but not overburdened. CSE consisted of:Operator Workstations, Collaboration Server (CS), Collective Intelligence Module (CIM), and Platform Support Environment (PSE). (1)  Planning and execution are integrated through the workstations and the collaboration server. This allows all workstations to simultaneously see and manipulate plans and execution information. The design includes provisions for a CDR decision aid using a knowledge base. (2) The CIM the PSE endow the Unit with it's network centric behavior. (a) The CIM is aware of the CDRs intent.  The execution of the current tactical situation will be enabled through the use of an expert knowledge based system. (b) The PSE defines platform TTPs using an expert knowledge based system (e.g., evasive maneuver). FCS C2 Experimentation (Phase III). The experimentation effort consisted of developing and testing the prototype C2 software in a series of experiments to validate the C2 system design Key to this effort is a crawl, walk, run approach, while reviewing the enabling technologies and systems (i.e. C2 Prototype, One Semi-Automated Forces TestBed (OTB), Sensor Effects model). Through its first four experiments, the FCS-C2 program has developed an initial infrastructure to represent critical integrated functionalities of the FCS unit maneuver, lethal and suppressive effects and intel/sensors.  Future experiments anticipate addition of detailed dismounted simulation, network-centric communication effects, RF jamming and other non-lethal effects, logistics/sustainment and expansion of the force structure beyond that of the FCS unit.  Existing simulation infrastructure, including a heavily-modified version of OTB, a Sensor Effects Model (SEM) and other supporting components are expected to require enhancements and supplements to provide the necessary synthetic environment for continued evaluation of the prototype software and affiliated battle concepts. SCOPE - RESEARCH TOPIC INTEREST: This part of the BAA contains statements of the Research Interests required by DARPA/ IXO. Prior to proposal submission, questions on technical matters and availability of project funding relating to a particular Research Interest should be directed to the DARPA Program Manager via email to BAA03-33@darpa.mil.  When responding/inquiring on a specific area of research, refer to the Topic Number listed below. Multicell and Dismounted C2 Background. The Multicell and Dismounted C2 research program (effort covered by the requirements of this BAA) will build on the earlier success and approach of the FCS C2 experimentation effort and expand the decision space to the operation of multiple FCS equipped units with higher headquarters, dismounted soldiers and joint force connectivity. The programs objective is to determine how further integration of Battle Command functions of multiple FCS units, dismounts and higher headquarters ( joint) may be achieved to support a network centric force. The program will build an expanded decision space to support these eschelons and functions with full collaboration. The program will consist of four major elements: 1) Architecture development and documentation 2) Testbed development and expansion, 3) Expansion of the decision space and Human Computer Interface to address the aforementioned levels of command and 4) Conduct a series of experiments as illustrated in the milestone chart (see PIP) to measure and assess the effectiveness of the mission software modules supporting the expanded decision space. The FCS-C2 Program is a fully interrelated program consisting of several interrelated Technical Topic Areas.  All offerors selected to provide Contractor Technical or other support under this BAA, as directed by the government, will be required to work as part of a Combined Technical Team.  As such, offerors should be prepared to work in close coordination with the collective personnel supporting the other Topic Areas of this BAA. The current Research Topic Interest Areas. (1)  Battle Command and Control For Future Combat Systems (C2 Prototype):  This topic seeks to encourage the developmental work in the area of mission software development that integrates formally stove-piped Battle Command functions into a single integrated display for decision making of an FCS equipped force.  This program will be examining multiple unit, higher headquarters and dismounted information needs for decision making thru integrated and innovative Battle Command solutions. (2)  C4ISR Modeling & Simulation For C2 Concept Assessment:  This topic seeks to encourage developmental work in the area of C4ISR modeling and simulation support to integrated Command and Control protoype for the FCS units family of systems design. A realistic C4ISR simulation provides a synthetic environment in which concepts and prototype software can be evaluated through appropriate stimulation and response.  Simulation provides a means to realistically represent current real-world capabilities in all areas of the C4ISR spectrum, as well as those that do not yet exist.
(3)  FCS C2 Architecture Development: Under the scope of this topic area, the offerors required performance will be broad, encompassing a wide range of research activities, to include the coordination, conduct and documentation of an architecture study to develop an operational and systems FCS C2 Architecture at the dismounted soldier level of command through the higher headquarters and joint levels of command supporting the Objective Force. (4)  FCS C2 Experiment Planning, Execution, and Analysis:  This topic area seeks the developmental work in the area of Experiment Planning, Design, Execution, Data Collection and Analysis. Innovative approaches to support experimentation in Battle Command in an emulated network centric environment are highly encouraged. (5)  Infrastructure Support for Development, Simulation, and Experimentation  Environments:  This topic seeks to encourage developmental work in the area of hardware/software integration, production of modeling and simulation support systems, prototyping, and systems engineering support to enable peek performance and reliability of Developmental, Simulation, and Experimentation Environments. Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards the goals stated.      Research should result in prototype hardware and/or software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research endeavors.  Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial cooperation and cost sharing.  Offerors may submit one or more proposals against any of the five (5) topic areas identified above.  It is the Governments intent that no more than one proposal be selected for any given topic area, and that Topic Area 1 and Topic Areas 2 through 5 be awarded to separate offerors.  Offerors are permitted to propose on any number/combination of Topic Areas 2 through 5 (i.e., one topic or multiple topics through a teaming approach). Funding:  The resulting contract(s)/agreement(s) will be incrementally funded by fiscal year, assuming identified milestones have been satisfactorily met. Funding in the out year(s) is subject to the availability of funds. Period of Performance:  The general contractual period of performance is anticipated to comprise approximately eighteen (18) months duration, however contracts may be executed for a lesser period of time.  The specific duration will be dependent on the performance goals of the Topic Area, but will not exceed twenty-four (24) months without options or thirty-six (36) months with options.

This includes coordination with a contractor or integrator, chosen by DARPA, if appropriate.  A statement of cooperation must be included in the final proposal. PROTECTION OF INFORMATION: It is the policy of DARPA to treat all proposals as competitive information and to disclose contents only for the purposes of evaluation and assessment. The Government may use selected support contractor personnel from Schafer Corporation, Solars, and McNeil Technologies to assist in administrative functions only. Those contractors sign binding, non-disclosure agreements with DARPA. REQUIREMENTS/PROCEDURES:  The Award Document for each proposal selected and funded will contain a mandatory requirement for submission of DARPA/IXO Quarterly Status Reports and an Extended Requirement for July Reports.  These reports will be electronically submitted via the DARPA/IXO Technical  Financial Information Management System (T-FIMS), utilizing the government furnished Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Further details may be found in the Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP).  PROPOSAL FORMAT: All offerors MUST register at: http://www.tfims.darpa.mil/baa 2 weeks prior to submitting a proposal.  PLEASE NOTE:  The deadline for registration is 07/31/03 at the URL listed above.  Only the lead or prime offerors should register.  One registration per proposal should be submitted.  This means that offeror wishing to submit multiple proposals should complete a single registration for each proposal.  By registering, the offeror has made no commitment to submit.  Proposal submissions must be unclassified.  The offeror must upload the electronic version of the full proposal to the DARPA website by 12:00 NOON (ET) Thursday, August 14, 2003, in order to be considered during the initial evaluation phase.  However, BAA 03-33, Multicell and Dismounted Command and Control, will remain open until 12:00 NOON (ET) Wednesday, June 30, 2004.  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA through Wednesday, June 30, 2004. While the proposals submitted after Thursday, August 14, 2003, deadline will be evaluated by the Government, proposers should keep in mind that the likelihood of funding such proposals is less than for those proposals submitted in connection with the initial evaluation and award schedule.  Offerors must obtain the BAA 03-33 Proposer Information Pamphlet (PIP), which provides further information on the areas of interest, submission, evaluation, funding processes, and full proposal formats.  The PIP is available for viewing or download at http://www.darpa.mil/ixo/solicitations/multicell/index.htm.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the PIP may not be reviewed.

<DESC>The Indian Head Division Naval Surface Warfare Center (IHDIVNAVSURFWARCEN) has interest in proposals for designing, analyzing and manufacturing a coextrusion system to be used in highly solids filled polymer, 70-80 % solids fill, applications. The system will be used in Indian Head Divisions pilot scale propellant processing facility.  The system should be capable of combining melt flows from a Werner & Pfleiderer, W&P, 40-mm twin-screw extruder and from a W&P 37-mm twin-screw extruder positioned ninety degrees from each other.  The 40-mm TSE will be the extruder positioned in line with the coextrusion die.  The configuration of the coextrusion product will be an ABA type.  The A layers will come from the 37-mm TSE with a required width of about five inches and a thickness of about 0.015 inches.  The B layer will come from the 40-mm TSE with a required width of about five inches  and a thickness of about 0.080 inches.  The manufacturer should provide the transition piece that will feed the melt flows from the extruders to the coextrusion die.  Circulating water/propylene glycol mixture will provide temperature control for the coextrusion die.  The system should be capable of venting in the event that either or both extruders reach a pressure of 3,000 psi and should be designed such that no stagnation of material occurs inside the die.  The coextrusion system should also provide features to control flow, to adjust layer distributions and correct layer instabilities. It should also include die lip adjustment for overall thickness, edge trimming capability and a remote take away spooling system for product collection. The equipment shall comply with Hazardous Location Class I, Division 1, Group D and Class II, Division 1, Groups E, F and G requirements.   The proposal shall include: a three-dimensional flow model analysis for the coextrusion system.  The data required from the flow analysis would be pressure distributions, shear stress, shear rates and residence time in different regions of the die.  The manufacturer should also provide graphical data of temperature, pressure, shear rate and residence time distributions in the die along with volumetric flow rate of the die. Engineering procedures for assembling, disassembling, cleaning and operating the coextrusion system should also be included as well as system oversight during an inert coextrusion run.  The Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center will provide,  after contract award, the data required by the manufacturer for the flow analysis and three-dimension model. Offerors may submit a one-page abstract of their proposal.  Any offeror whose abstract is found t o be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a full technical and cost proposal. Such an invitation does not assure subsequent contract award. Proposals may be reviewed and acted on as they arrive. The government reserves the right to select for award, all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement. Abstracts and proposals should include the following: (a) title page - include point of contact along with address, telephone and telefax number, e-mail address, and signature by an authorized officer. Evaluations of proposals will be based on the following criteria:  (1) offers innovative coextrusion die design, flow modeling and manufacturing (2) technical expertise and related experience (3) cost and schedule breakdown to meet program milestones such as die design, manufacturing and inert coextrusion trial  (4) the proposed co sts and availability of funds. This announcement will remain open for 21 days from the date of publication.

<DESC>THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT ACCEPT TELEPHONED, E-MAILED, LETTER-WRITTEN, OR FAXED REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION (RFP) FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.   Instead, all prospective offerors must retrieve the solicitation from this FedBizOpps web site, when the solicitation is hereafter published.  Although this is a FULL-AND-OPEN-COMPETITIVE procurement, there IS an INCUMBENT contractor:  TML Information Services, Inc., located at 116-55 Queens Boulevard, Forest Hills, NY 11375; and TMLs contact person is Sean Dougherty at telephone number (800) 743-7891.   In the past four years, TML has performed background work, which, to some degree, serves as an important foundation for the NEW project (procurement) announced herein.   For details concerning the background work performed by TML, prospective offerors are instructed to contact TML.  HOWEVER, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) does plan to publish----as an attachment to the SOLICITATION (RFP) hereafter issued for the NEW procurement announced herein----a copy of a relevant background REPORT produced by TML in November of 2001, entitled Mexico vis a vis International Registration Plan (IRP)/International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA).  To the best of the FHWAs knowledge, that background report is NOT now available on-line, at any web site or Internet address.  The FHWA is NOT in a position to release that background report NOW, because it is too LENGTHY to fit within the space constraints imposed on this SYNOPSIS.  Under the NEW project (procurement) announced herein, the FHWA plans to award a CONTRACT for assistance in helping the states to implement a program to provide the required registration and fuel tax credentials to Mexican commercial motor carriers wishing to do business beyond the commercial zone in the United States.  In addition, the FHWA needs assistance in the development of a reciprocity arrangement on credentials for US commercial motor carriers wishing to do business in Mexico.   The scope of work for this new project will include participating with the credentials team to help develop a mid-term solution and assist the FHWA, National Governors Association (NGA), the IRP and IFTA Associations and US border states in the implementation of the mid-term plan and the reciprocity agreement with Mexico.  Key to the implementation of the mid-term plan will be establishing a motor carrier team for the FHWA and NGA credentialing team to work with on determining issues related to credentialing along with forecasting the estimated number of trucks that will be included in the new reciprocity agreement.  Also key to the implementation will be working with the border jurisdictions on the language needed to modify the IRP and IFTA agreements to permit reciprocity with Mexico.  And a crucially important piece will be developing the necessary support documents to shepherd the ballots successfully through the associations legal processes and to help with the implementation of the new language.  To be competitive, an offerors proposal will probably need to:  (a) demonstrate the offerors established working relationship with, and understanding of, the Mexican Secretaria de Communicacaciones y Transportes (SCT), the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators, IRP, IFTA, NGA, both trucking associations in Mexico, and the American Trucking Associations; and (b) demonstrate the offerors previous experience in providing support to the US States and the Mexican SCT in the development of an electronic on-line access or registration system.   THE DUE DATE FOR THE FHWAS RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS, AS PUBLISHED IN THIS SYNOPSIS, IS ONLY AN ESTIMATED DUE DATE.  THE ACTUAL DUE DATE FOR THE FHWAS RECEIPT OF PROPOSALS WILL BE STATED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE SOLICITATION (RFP) HEREAFTER PUBLISHED.  The FHWAs best current ESTIMATE is that the solicitation MIGHT be published in this FedBizOpps web site on or about July 31, 2003.   Any prospective offeror who retrieves the solicitation must be sure to frequently RE-CHECK FedBizOpps for any AMENDMENTS to the solicitation.  Re-checking for such amendments is IMPERATIVE, because amendments usually contain crucial information.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center intends to award a modification to purchase order N00244-03-P-1566 for an additional 320 man-hours  of effort to archive and edit historical submarine and digital ice draft data.  The period of performance is being extended from 30 Sept 2003 to 31 Dec 2003 to enable the completion of the work already begun under purchase order N00244-03-P-1566.   This effort is being sole sourced to Bronson Hills Associates because it is the only company with sufficient knowledge of arctic sea ice, sea ice drafts, sound velocity, and data formats required to perform and complete this effort; however, all responsible sources may submit a response explaining how their company can meet the government's requirements which will be considered by the agency for the purpose of deciding whether to conduct a competitive procurement. The original RFQ and statement of w ork is available at www.neco.navy.mil under RFQ N00244-03-T-0504.  See Note 22. Commercial procedures are not being used for this effort. The modification is expected to be awarded about 11 July 2003.

<DESC>USAID intends to issue an RFP for emergency construction services of street/road rehabilitation/repair in the Palestinian West Bank and Gaza. This contract is open for competition by local Palestinian contractors according to 22-CFR228.40-d (Local Procurement estimated not to exceed $5,000,000). The Emergency Road Rehabilitation project is part of the US led effort to support the new Road Map for peace in the Middle East. The restoration of roads will improve access to markets and the movement of labor and goods.  The Palestinian construction industry will receive an economic stimulus.  There will be employment opportunities, increases in materials supplied, and a reinvigorated manufacturing sector.  Five hundred new jobs and an estimated 15,000 person days of employment will be created.  Over one million Palestinian people will benefit through cost and time savings, by having more reliable transportation services, or simply by having a better future with more opportunities because of restored roads.  The scope of this Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract includes the reconstruction, rehabilitation and repair of roads and streets in six geographic areas of the West Bank and Gaza, specifically Bethlehem, Hebron, Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin, and Northern Gaza.   All work must be performed by the contractors own resources with minimal, if any, subcontracting of the construction work.  USAID contemplates the implementation of this project through making multiple awards of direct (IDIQ) construction contracts.  The contractor must be able to mobilize immediately. The contractor must have similar construction experience and demonstrated capability of managing such project under the current conditions of political unrest.

<DESC>The US Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, in Pendleton, OR has a requirement for the following instrument with characteristics as follows:
The analyzer is to be based on the flash combustion of the sample followed by reduction and complete GC separation and detection of the products by a thermal conductivity detector.The elemental analyzer must be capable of simultaneous determination of the elements specified in the system configuration: N, N/Protein, NC, NCS, CHN, CHNS, or O.  The analyzer needs to be capable of analyzing both soil and plant samples.
A complete gas chromatographic separation must be accomplished on the elements of interest for improved accuracy and precision and the entire gas sample resulting from combustion must be analyzed. Splitting, dilution, or "trapping & purging" of the combustion gases are not acceptable.
The system must be capable of being reconfigured for alternate applications such as oxygen analysis by pyrolysis or sulfur only analyses without addition of optional detectors or furnaces.
The instrument control software must be capable of adjusting the detector gain (x1 or x10) during an analysis for greater sensitivity on low level components.  The lower detection limits for all elements (N2 & CO2) must be 1g in liquid samples; 50-100 l, or solid samples; 1.0 mg  1.0 g (depending on the nature of the sample).
The instrument control software must control oxygen introduction for oxidation of samples and automatically adjust based on the weight and matrix of each individual sample for economical operation.
The system must employ continuous flow design to allow operational interface with alternate detectors such as Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometers for measurement of stable isotopes of N, C, & S or Flame Photometric Detectors for trace sulfur determination, etc.  References required.  The system must use a single Thermal Conductivity Detector for analysis of all elements for increased accuracy and ease of maintenance.
The elemental analyzer must include an autosampler with a capacity for up to 125 samples (32-position standard).

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition & Logistics Division, on behalf of the NIST/Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, with Forschungszentrum Juelich (FZ Juelich) of Germany for the purchase of a
Neutron Chopper System.***The NCNR is developing a new neutron scattering technique to enhance its current capabilities in Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS).  This new technique will enable neutron scattering studies of the characteristic motions of macromolecules on millisecond time scales for the first time.***The system shall comprise a pair of high-speed, counter-rotating slotted disks in a vacuum tight protective enclosure plus all associated electronics for controlling the speeds, phasing the chopper disks, and monitoring the system to assure safe operation.  The system shall incorporate NIST's existing custom-designed and fabricated chopper disks that were fabricated by the Institut Laue Langevin in France, under a previous procurement.  In addition, the system must be designed and built for installation in a single 1.5m long section of the pre-sample flight path of the NCNR's NG3 SANS instrument.***Sole source determination is based on FZ Juelich of Germany being the only source with the unique expertise required to design and manufacture the chopper system.  FZ Juelich has an existing design for disk chopper systems for neutron scattering applications with similar performance requirements.  This design has been successfully built & tested.  Furthermore, the chopper system requires integration of NIST's existing chopper disks.  The Institut Laue Langevin is the sole designer/manufacturer and has proprietary rights to chopper disk designs and detailed information about the designs necessary for integration.  FZ Juelich and the Institut have cooperative projects in some areas.  Because of their professional relationship, FZ Juelich will have access to proprietary information with respect to the chopper disks that no other source has or could obtain.***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 18 months after receipt of order.***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by July 14, 2003, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>POC: Evangla Kunene, Procurement Data Manager, Tel: 703-875-4357, Fax: 703-875-4009, Email: ekunene@tda.gov.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Dr. Juan Carlos Velez Uribe, Director General, Unidad Administrativa Especial de Aeronutica Civil (UAEAC), Aeropuerto Internacional Eldorado, Piso 4, Direccion General, Bogota D.C., Colombia, Phone:  (571) 266-3587, Fax:  (571) 266-3849, email: agarcia@aerocivil.gov.co. The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide Technical Assistance (TA) to the Colombian civil aviation authority, Unidad Administrativa Especial de Aeronutica Civil (UAEAC), also known as AEROCIVIL, in the area of aeronautical meteorological systems for modern air traffic management.  

In 1993, Colombia issued a constitutional mandate to reform the public sector in various areas within the government.  The following year, a decree established AEROCIVIL, the Colombian civil aviation authority, to direct the development of the airports in Colombia.  AEROCIVIL has adopted, as an institutional priority, the implementation of new technologies that match actual and future air navigation levels and security standards.  

Meteorological services are a critical part of a modern integrated air traffic control system.  A modern weather information system would help reduce communication errors and reliance on voice radio communications; and, increase airlines operational abilities by allowing pilots to receive reliable real-time weather forecasts, thus enabling them to avoid hazardous weather conditions.  Due to a successful USTDA-funded Orientation Visit (OV) in 2002, AEROCIVIL requested USTDA assistance in moving forward with its objective to develop and implement a 10-year plan to modernize Colombia's aeronautical meteorology infrastructure and related services.

The TA focuses on the provision of meteorological services in compliance with the recommendations of the International Civil Aviation Organization and the Federal Aviation Administration.  The TA will evaluate the existing system in Colombia and will meet projected needs and technology requirements for meteorological equipment and real-time information for aviation weather services.  The objectives include:  1) Evaluation of the existing aeronautical meteorology infrastructure, obsolete equipment and systems, and the identification of significant deficiencies; 2) Development of a modernization approach that will meet forecasted needs and technology requirements; 3) Identification of technical alternatives for the modernization of vital equipment; 4) Preparation and presentation of an operational, economic and financial viability analysis for each of the proposed technical alternatives; 5) Preparation of a prioritized capital investment program; and,  6) Analysis of the organizational structure of the Instituto de Hidrologia, Meteorologia y Estudios Ambientales (IDEAM), with a specific focus on the enhancement of the provision of services, including best management practices.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the Technical Assistance include the following:

	Task 1. Perform site visits and assess the current infrastructure of the aeronautical meteorology system.  
	Task 2. Determine the best technology options and create a prioritized, phased investment/development plan that accommodates transitions to CNS/ATM technology
	Task 3. Review the organizational and management structure of UAEAC and IDEAM, and make suggestions to enhance the provision of services and meteorological research
	Task 4. Present operational, economical, financial and environmental viability analyses for each of the technical options.  
	Task 5: Develop financing options
	Task 6: Provide a final aeronautical meteorology system development plan.
	Task 7.  Potential Bidders Briefing (to be determined by the USTDA regional staff).

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $370,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

IMPORTANT:  When submitting a proposal for this TA study, the bidder must be aware that the TA will require travel to Colombia.  

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the TOR, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in Spanish and English directly to the Grantee by 4:00PM local Bogota, Colombia time, August 11, 2003 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Sources Sought.  The General Services Administration (GSA) has a requirement for a full range of multi-channel, contact-center services to manage and operate the General Services Administration's Federal Citizen Information Center (FCIC) National Contact Center (NCC), formerly known as the Federal Information Center, and to provide the same services to other agencies in support the USA Services E-Gov initiative.  The scope of work involves providing a wide range of automated and attended information services through multiple communications channels, including telephone, facsimile, postal mail, e-mail, and the Internet.  The scope of work is also intended to include support for the requirements of other agencies and organizations with the same or similar programs.  The GSA anticipates awarding multiple, indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) contracts to fulfill these requirements.  

Specific services to be provided include the following:  (i) provide a wide range of automated and customer support services, using multiple communications channels, to respond to inquiries about Federal government programs, policies, information sources and agencies from the general public, Congressional offices, business and professional communities, academia, government offices, and electronic and print media.  The multiple communications channels include telephone, facsimile, postal mail, e-mail, the Internet, and other media as appropriate; (ii) provide and maintain all required facilities, equipment, software, supplies, and services, to support the automated and customer support services and technical and management functions; (iii) provide sufficient qualified personnel to support all automated and customer support services and to perform all required technical and management functions;  (iv) provide services that are fully accessible by individuals with disabilities as required by Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998;  (v) perform all technical and management functions needed to plan, design, implement, operate, and manage these services, including, program management, technology management, information management, relationship management support, human resources management, performance management, quality management, management reports, security, contingency and disaster recovery, and value engineering; (vi) provide special project support needed to analyze, plan, design, implement, operate and manage special customer support services that may be needed to meet the diverse needs of the Government; and (vii) conduct public outreach and advertising programs which include publishing telephone numbers and telephone directories for agency-specified service areas.  

Firms that qualify as a Small Business or a Small-Disadvantaged Business under the size standard for the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 519190, Other Information Services, ($6.0 million in annual revenue) are encouraged to notify the Contracting Officer within fifteen (15) calendar days from the date of this synopsis with information attesting to their ability to perform the required work.  This notification can be up to five (5) pages in length and should include a detailed description of the firms capability to provide all services within the scope of work.  This capability statement can be sent via E-mail to bob.corey@gsa.gov, or mailed to Robert H. Corey at the street address shown above.  The minimum experience requirements for this project are stated below.  

A draft solicitation, consisting of Sections B, C, G, H, and J, has been posted on the Federal Business Opportunities web site (http://www.fedbizopps.gov).  Since a set-aside determination has not yet been made, we are encouraging all potential offerors, both large and small, and other interested parties to assist us in refining our requirements by providing questions or comments concerning the draft solicitation via E-mail to bob.corey@gsa.gov.  We will need all such questions or comments by July 17, 2003.  In performing this requirement the contractor will provide (i) all necessary personnel, training, supervision, administrative support and management; (ii) all facilities, supplies, equipment and IT hardware and services; (iii) all telecommunications except that provided by the Government, (iv) all software and research and reference materials (except those provided by the Government); (v) current information to the public according to directions provided by the Government; and (vi) a quality control program.  The contractor will be able to perform the work requirements of their contract at one work site within the United States, or at multiple work sites within the United States.  

With regards to the National Call Center (NCC) task, the contractor will be responsible for responding to approximately 2 million telephone and 50,000 e-mail inquiries from the general public annually.  Inquiries are on subjects that cover the entire range of Federal activities and concerns and on specific programs supported by the FCIC.  Responses are in the form of referrals to other agencies, mailing of printed information, providing information directly, or linking the inquirer and the information provider.  The contractor will be responsible for maintaining and keeping current a knowledge base used by the NCCs information specialists in responding to public inquiries.  Among the tasks the contractor will perform are the updating and maintenance of knowledge bases, processing orders for publications, handle liaison with government agencies and with the media.  At this time, the NCC is anticipated to be the largest requirement offered as a task order under the proposed IDIQ contracts.  However, as the USA Services initiative evolves, other task orders may be issued to support requirements that surpass the scope and/or work volume of the NCC.  It is also anticipated that quotations for the NCC requirement will be requested no later than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004.  Each firm awarded a contract in response to this requirement will be given an opportunity to submit a proposal for the NCC task.  

In order to be technically qualified for award of an IDIQ contract under this requirement a firm must have had the following experience during the past five (5) years: (i) At least three (3) years of general experience in providing information and referral services similar in nature and scope, and equal to or greater than in terms of monthly work volumes to the NCCs historical workload mentioned above; (ii) at least one (1) year of specialized experience in providing information services in a multi-media environment, including the use of telephone, facsimile, e-mail, and Web-based media; (iii) at least three (3) years of experience in providing information services in a multi-language environment; (iv) at least three (3) years experience successfully fulfilling the requirements of a performance based contract or similar contractual vehicle; and (v) at least two (2) years of specialized experience in handling case management in an information and referral service.*****

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>As required by the OMB Circular No. A-76 dated May 29, 2003; this public announcement is in conjunction with the previous announcements of November 14, 2002, and February 11, 2003.  DOE is in the process of conducting a standard A-76 Cost Comparison of its Financial Services to determine whether it would be more efficient and cost-effective to perform the financial services using DOE?s most efficient organization (MEO), another Federal agency, or a commercial contractor.  This competition will be conducted through the Oak Ridge Operations office using normal contracting requirements and OMB Circular A-76 (Revised) dated May 29, 2003.  If the MEO or other Federal agency proposal is determined to be the best value, this solicitation will be canceled and no contract will be awarded. This solicitation is for providing financial services to the majority of DOE sites, which is currently performed at 15 DOE locations. (Germantown, MD; Albuquerque, NM; Oak Ridge, TN; Argonne, IL; Golden, CO; Idaho Falls, ID; Pittsburgh, PA; Morgantown, WV; Las Vegas, NV; Oakland, CA; Casper, WY; Miamisburg, OH; Richland, WA; Aiken, SC; and New Orleans, LA) The DOE?s current accounting system, DISCAS (Departmental Integrated Standardized Core Accounting System) has been operating for approximately 20 years.  Due to the age and obsolescence of the system, DOE plans to implement an Oracle based financial system, Standard Accounting and Reporting System (STARS), on October 1, 2004.  The Offeror will operate the new system, STARS, and will not be required to operate the DOE legacy system.  The ORACLE modules being implemented are purchasing, accounts payable, accounts receivable, fixed assets, and general ledger.  DOE will be implementing the U. S. Standard General Ledger concurrent with the implementation of STARS.  DOE will provide the successful offeror with training on DOE-specific design and configuration of the ORACLE Federal Financials, STARS. Currently the work is being performed by approximately 160 federal employees and 22 contractor employees.  Information concerning the current contracts will also be posted on the DOE Interactive Industry Procurement System (IIPS) website at http://e-center.doe.gov/. Under the OMB Circular dated May 29, 2003, several competition officials have been appointed.  The Competitive Sourcing Official (CSO) will be James T. Campbell; the Contracting Officer will be Willis Davis; and John R. Pescosolido will be the Agency Tender Official (ATO).  A selection decision is anticipated during the first quarter of Calendar Year 2004. DOE posts all procurement information on the DOE Interactive Industry Procurement System (IIPS) website at http://e-center.doe.gov/.

<DESC>Contact Person:  Carol Watkins (816) 823-4906.

June 30, 2003:  The following synopsis has been amended.  For this solicitation, when all technical evaluation factors are combined, they are approximately equal to the cost or price.  A trade off process will be used.  These changes are included below, in the paragraph explaining the selection process.

The purpose of this source selection procurement is to select a quality Design-Build Services contractor for Air Handling Improvements (IMO23990) at Federal Building 2, 1500 East Bannister Road, Kansas City, Missouri, Solicitation Number GS06P02GZC0540.  The contractor selected will be responsible for taking the scope and performance documents (prepared by an architect/ engineer) through design and construction.  The estimated cost of design and construction for the design-build contract is between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000.  The approximate contract length is 24 months after Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about September 1, 2003.  This procurement will be completed using a one step source selection process, with full and open competition, limited to those firms having an existing design, construction, and/or design-build contracting office within the bi-state Kansas City region as of the date of the CBD announcement.  The bi-state region, as defined by the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC), consists of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray.

Building 2 of the Bannister Federal Complex is a fully occupied office building of approximately 250,000 gross square feet, which consists of a basement and two levels above ground.  The five air handling units in three roof top fan houses were added to the building around 1960.

The scope of work includes the following:  1)  Sealing all chase penetrations and openings; relocating any obstructions to airflow in the chases; installing fire dampers and access panels; installing fire-rated enclosures; and replacing control valves, steam traps, strainers and roll filter media in the fan house units; 2) Phased replacement of supply and return fans and motors and the conversion of the existing constant volume system to a variable air volume system; 3) Replacement or repair of all existing supply ductwork on the roof; 4) Provision of outside air to existing packaged units located throughout the building; 5) Provision of a new variable air volume, direct digital control system with a fixed supply air temperature; 6) Relocation of existing ground level air intakes to the roof; and 7) Maximizing energy efficiency within the constraints of life cycle cost reasonableness. 

The request for proposals (RFP) solicitation is expected to be issued on or about June 27, 2003.  All requests for the RFP must be in writing.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents.  Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must provide valid identification in the form of one of the following:  a business license; DUNS number, or valid state drivers license.  A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held at 1500 East Bannister Road on or about July 8, 2003, to brief prospective offerors and to explain or clarify the project scope and submission requirements.  GSA will receive Requests for Proposal on or about July 29, 2003.  Date and time will be specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror. 

GSA intends to use the trade off process in selecting the offer that is most advantageous to the Government.  The trade off process is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation and price, with the goal being to select the proposal that offers the greatest value to the Government, i.e. the proposal that offers the most for the money, not necessarily the lowest price.  Offerors will submit technical qualifications and price at the same time, in separate packages.  Technical factors, in descending order of importance are:  1)  Past performance of the firm; 2)  Qualifications of key personnel; 3) Management plan; and 4) Team composition and prior experience as a Design-Build team.  Technical factors 1 and 2 will be given equal weight in the evaluation process.  For this solicitation, when all technical evaluation factors are combined, they are approximately equal to the cost or price.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposals acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  The Government will evaluate all proposals.  The evaluation team will comply with the GSA Source Selection Policy with respect to nondisclosure, conflict of interest, safeguarding of data and any other regulatory or statutory requirement therein stated or referenced.  This is a negotiated procurement that will result in a firm-fixed price contract.  Award of a contract will be contingent upon funding approval. 

Prior to award of the contract, the contractor, if not a small business will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.  The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  As part of its commitment to socioeconomic initiatives of the Federal Government, the General Services Administration has established subcontracting goals of 40 percent total for Small Business (SB), which includes 8 percent for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB); 5 percent for Woman-Owned Small Business (WOSB), 3 percent for Hub Zone Small Business; (HZSB); 5 percent for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB); and 3 percent for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).  All responsible sources may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  Contact Carol Watkins, Contract Specialist, to request the RFP and for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4906 or fax her at 816-823-5523.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, George Gourse, at 816-823-2262.

<DESC>Thie Modification changes the due date from August 20, 2003 to July 18, 2003.

This is a REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Reference Remote LAN Trace Tool when responding to this announcement. The Social Security Administration (SSA) is attempting to identify vendors that are capable of providing a software application for remote LAN tracing that does not require its own hardware. The Agency is seeking sources that produce a software package and/or solution that will meet the following requirements: 1) remote packet captures: The product must be able to remotely gather network layer data [layers 1, 2, and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnect (OSI) model] for real-time analysis and be able to transport that data to a central site to be saved for future analysis, 2) unattended format: The tool must be able to operate in an environment devoid of user intervention. That means that an engineer or user at HQ or another site must be able to initiate a capture remotely, without anyone at the user site providing assistance, 3) No third party initiation tool [Microsoft System Management Server (SMS), remote control, etc.]: Once the tool is installed, no 3rd tool may be required to initiate the trace or download (e.g. NT scheduler may not be used to initiate a trace). SMS or a 3rd party tool MAY be used for initial install. Initiation, use of the tool must not require a remote take over/ remote control of the target machine. We want the ability to interact with the software remotely without having to use another piece of software to control the tracing. Also we want to be able to use a third tool like SMS to install it remotely so that we do not have to install it on each of the 100,000+ workstations in the network one by one manually, 4) Integrated conversion tool (.enc format): The tool must be capable of saving the trace files into required formats on its own. No 3rd party tool may be required for saving data in the formats specified elsewhere within this document. The minimum required format is NAI .ENC format, 5) the product must be capable of the full 7 layer OSI model decode. Product must decode, at a minimum, the following networking protocols; TCP/IP  all IP protocol  icmp, tcp, udp, etc, http, SNA, DLC, 6) Generated reports must be capable of saving in several common formats  Microsoft Word .doc format, text file format, RTF, HTML, .PDF, 7)  Pre and Post filtering (Mac address, IP address, protocol, sender, designation), 8) Product must allow user to specify search criteria before capture is initiated that will narrow down the search results (and decrease the file size) (pattern matching), 9) Product must also allow user to specify criteria that will narrow the search results AFTER the capture is completed and transferred to the user, 10)  Frame slicing  product must be able to capture only the specified portion of a frame, 11) Product licensing: Product must be licensed on an enterprise basis. This means that pricing may not be incremental based on number of machines under the product umbrella, 12) View the real time status of the decode and trace (bytes, frames, buffer, etc.), 13) Provide trace analysis: Product must provide an expert analysis of the trace upon receipt of the completed trace. This should present itself in both executive type reports as well as data level decodes of the trace data. Expert suggestions about root cause analysis should be available as well, 14) Merge traces: Product must be able to merge two or more separate trace files together into one for analysis, 15) No preset limit on trace file size, 16) Runs on all Unix and Windows platforms: This includes but is not limited to, specifically, Windows 2000, XP, NT, and Solaris, 17) Licensing sharing: Product licensing must have the capability to be centrally managed, 18) Security: Must integrate with Windows security, 19) the product must be delivered in CDROM format, 20) provide documentation both in printed format and on CDROM, 21) provide both email and telephone support during normal business hours, with additional non-prime time options available, and 22) Compliancy with Section 508. Interested vendors must be able to provide verifiable proof by submitting information in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the Agencys requirement. Vendors responding should indicate whether their services are available on the GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government Wide Agency Contract (GWAC). This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the data received. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSAs assessment of capable sources. Responses to this notice should be submitted electronically by August 20, 2003. No Faxed responses. Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged. NO FORMAL SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AT THIS TIME. ELECTRONIC RESPONSES ONLY, to the POC identified above.

<DESC>A U. S. Government lease for four regulatory agencies  NLRB, FTC, FERC and FLRA  in San Francisco, CA, will expire on 12/31/03.  The current space is fully built out to accommodate the ongoing needs of all four of these agencies.  It consists of a mix of private office, open areas, hearing and conference rooms, law libraries and associated space common to modern office usage.  The government will consider alternative replacement if such space is economically advantageous.  The required replacement space must total approximately 50,000 rentable square feet (or roughly 43,500 ANSI/BOMA usable square feet) plus five structured/secure parking spaces.  Economically advantageous means the total cost to the Government for fully built out space (including the amortized cost of all required tenant improvement) will not exceed an effective total annual rent of $1,150,000 over the lease term.  In determining whether alternative space is economically advantageous, the Government will consider, in addition to lease costs:  relocation costs, the cost of relocating/duplicating existing telecommunications and data infrastructure, and other non-recurring relocation costs.  The term of the lease will be seven years.  The area of consideration is confined to the Central Business District of San Francisco, or the area contained within the following boundaries:  The Embarcadero, Stockton, Bush, Franklin extended to the corner of Mission and Otis Highway 101, and Harrison.  Only quality Class A and B buildings will be considered.  Buildings containing asbestos and PCBs will not be considered nor will first floor space.  In considering whether alternative space can be provided within the limitations set forth herein, potential offerors are advised test fit layout plans may be required to enable a fair comparison between what is being offered versus the existing configuration and buildout.  Further, interested parties should be aware that tenant improvement costs for fully built out space for these agencies have been historically estimated at $52.00 per usable square foot (an amount exceeded in several recent, new leases).  Potential offerors are advised this T.I. projection does not include many significant costs the Government deems shell construction costs, such as:  HVAC, lighting, ceilings, floor finishes and mechanical/electrical/telecommunication rooms.  Offerors who believe they can develop and present a viable proposal to meet this requirement, for a rental cost not exceeding the aforementioned amount, at an otherwise competitive rate given the other economic variables to be considered, must contact the Government representative cited below.

<DESC>This requirement is limited to only those previously qualified and li= sted on the Southwest Regional Qualified Vendors List (QVL) for the Results=  Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA). The FAA has an evolving requirement for a Aviation Safety/Accident Preventi= on (ASAP) reporting system, a key element in providing the FAA with empiric= al data and easy access to information regarding aircraft system difficulty=  trends and other accident precursor information. =20 The FAA Administrator=E2=80=99s Safer Skies initiative requires that the FA= A become a data driven agency that uses a proactive, empirical approach to = initiate corrective measures before accidents occur.  ASAP provides that em= pirical data. =20 Background and Objectives The Rotorcraft Directorate (ASW-100) created the ASAP information system th= at collects aircraft data from a number of national databases.  ASAP is a r= elational database, created in FoxPro 2.6, that adds trends and warnings to=  safety data not available in the national databases.  Accountable technica= l personnel investigate, analyze, and input safety information from operato= rs and manufacturers to provide an in-depth analytical capability.  The abi= lity to discover trends and initiate warnings gives FAA senior decision mak= ers information for proactive safety measures in support of Safer Skies ini= tiatives. The current ASAP system needs re-hosting to a new software platfo= rm and an upgrade of its capabilities to meet the Continued Operational Saf= ety Management (COSM) business plan items. =20 Contractor support is needed to produce documentation of the current ASAP s= ystem.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to negotiate, under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, a new one (1) year contract with DynPort Vaccine Company (DVC).  DVC has recently developed an updated manufacturing method for a live attenuated bacterial vaccine against tularemia (LVS) and produced a GMP pilot lot suitable for clinical investigation.  The product is currently undergoing lot release and preclinical  testing in preparation for filing an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission with the FDA.  The goals of the contract are to complete ongoing preclinical and product testing of this product and filing an IND, with an option to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial. The planned contract will provide for continued development of the vaccine candidate for a period of one (1) year, using FY04 appropriated funds.  Tasks include repeat dose pharmacology and toxicology studies, stability testing of recently manufactured investigational product, production of placebo product for the phase 1 trial, compiling data for IND submission and coordinating the design and possible execution of a phase 1 clinical trial.  Inherent duplication of cost to the government and the difficulty in developing a new product make competition unfeasible for this project.  See Numbered Note 22.  No collect calls will be accepted.
