The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements and is cited in each individual solicitation. For qualification information/source approval request contact Jennifer Bugler, DLA-Aviation/AOB at extension (405) 736-3208.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.  US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation.  The form, including instructions for completing the form, is available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/forminfo/forminfopage2220.html.  The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued.  Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 736-3273. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 

Electronic procedure will be used for this solicitation.

Additionally, this Sources Sought Notice is to inform interested parties of an upcoming industry day being hosted at the Adelphi Laboratory Center, Building 205, 2800 Powder Mill Rd, 20783-1197 tentatively scheduled for 13 December 2016 at 9:00AM.

Objective:
<p>To find sources that are qualified to meet the requirements in section 11B and 11C within the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). Note that the specific requirements are subject to change prior to the release of any solicitation.<br /><br />B. Requirements:<br /><br />The Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Adelphi Division on behalf of the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of this Market Research is to identify concerns that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities necessary to provide Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This Sources Sought is issued to communicate the ARL's program requirement to industry. ARL intends to use information gathered from these responses to gain awareness of capabilities, determine interested parties, and to support formulation of an acquisition strategy. Early industry involvement in creating a properly scaled enterprise solution is critical to the success of this contemplated acquisition. <br /><br />C. Specifications:<br /><br />This effort is for the Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This work includes research and technical services supporting mission areas defined in Technology Program Agreements with Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) centers in information assurance (IA) and computer network operations. ARL collaborates with partners in other CSSPs, the law enforcement and counter intelligence communities in the areas of technology development and computer security research. The focus across the effort is defense against the sophisticated cyber adversaries to ARL, the Army, DoD, and the United States (US) Government. This effort strives to improve the state of the art in cyber defense. Cyber defense R&amp;D is reliant on raw data from real-world networks that contain vital evidence of the threats being perpetrated by hostiles against the network. Analysis of the data and the ability to improve attack detection accuracy and timeliness is intrinsically coupled with the agile development of new tools and techniques to combat adversaries. This ARL cyber defense effort partners with many organizations; some of which use the ARL CSSP services to provide primary or supplementary network defense services. Some are research partners using ARL-developed cyber defense tools and test-beds, and others are intelligence and law enforcement organizations that leverage ARL technology and share vital information about current threats.

<DESC>Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />(1) Action Code : SOURCES SOUGHT<br />This is a Sources Sought Notice only. This is not a request for proposal, but a survey to locate potential sources. This Sources Sought does not constitute an Invitation for Bids, Request for Proposals, or a Request for Quotations, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an order or otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is it a guarantee of a forthcoming solicitation or contract. It is for market research purposes only. Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.<br />The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to gain knowledge of interest, capabilities, and qualifications of various businesses in advance of a planned solicitation for Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP). Additionally, this Sources Sought Notice is to inform interested parties of an upcoming industry day being hosted at the Adelphi Laboratory Center, Building 205, 2800 Powder Mill Rd, 20783-1197 tentatively scheduled for 13 December 2016 at 9:00AM.

Objective:
<p>To find sources that are qualified to meet the requirements in section 11B and 11C within the attached Performance Work Statement (PWS). Note that the specific requirements are subject to change prior to the release of any solicitation.<br /><br />B. Requirements:<br />The Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Adelphi Division on behalf of the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), is conducting market research in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10. The purpose of this Market Research is to identify concerns that have the skills, experience, knowledge, and capabilities necessary to provide Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This Sources Sought is issued to communicate the ARL's program requirement to industry. ARL intends to use information gathered from these responses to gain awareness of capabilities, determine interested parties, and to support formulation of an acquisition strategy. Early industry involvement in creating a properly scaled enterprise solution is critical to the success of this contemplated acquisition. <br /><br />C. Specifications:<br />This effort is for the Research and Development (R&amp;D) and technical services needed to support the CyberSecurity Service Provider (CSSP) and its evolution in the face of a changing threat environment. This work includes research and technical services supporting mission areas defined in Technology Program Agreements with Research, Development and Engineering Command (RDECOM) centers in information assurance (IA) and computer network operations. ARL collaborates with partners in other CSSPs, the law enforcement and counter intelligence communities in the areas of technology development and computer security research. The focus across the effort is defense against the sophisticated cyber adversaries to ARL, the Army, DoD, and the United States (US) Government. This effort strives to improve the state of the art in cyber defense. Cyber defense R&amp;D is reliant on raw data from real-world networks that contain vital evidence of the threats being perpetrated by hostiles against the network. Analysis of the data and the ability to improve attack detection accuracy and timeliness is intrinsically coupled with the agile development of new tools and techniques to combat adversaries. This ARL cyber defense effort partners with many organizations; some of which use the ARL CSSP services to provide primary or supplementary network defense services. Some are research partners using ARL-developed cyber defense tools and test-beds, and others are intelligence and law enforcement organizations that leverage ARL technology and share vital information about current threats. The extensive network view is a key enabler to the cyber research and technology enhancement mission. This effort's initiative is particularly focused on improving capabilities to combat sophisticated cyber adversaries as well as investigating the next generation of Defensive Cyber Operational Tools, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP), tactical network security, exploring prospective sensor capabilities, executing components of the Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) strategy, risk measurement and monitoring, improving adversary attribution, and insider threat analysis.

<DESC><p>This is a PRESOLICITATION notice to publicize the planned draft solicitation release for the Common Helmet Mounted Display (CHMD) requirement on or around 14 December 2016 under solicitation number W58RGZ-17-R-0043.</p>
<p>This is NOT an authorization to begin work, and does NOT commit the Government to purchase any hardware or services. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect costs or charges will arise as a result of any responses to the notice. Interested parties shall submit their interest to the Government point of contact Ashley Wilbourn by 9 December 2016. All communication shall be submitted in writing to ashley.r.wilbourn.civ@mail.mil. No telephone calls are authorized.</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Redstone (ACC-RSA) has a requirement for production of the CHMD System. The requirement will be a five (5) year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for hardware and services. The Government plans to procure a Non Developmental Item (NDI) display capable of satisfying the Air Soldier System CHMD requirements, Support Equipment, Repair Parts, and Carrying Case hardware items in addition to post production support. The contractor shall perform the integration of the selected display with the Army helmet platform; Advanced Sight and Display Computer (ASDC); and aviation platform. The integration activity results in an Air Worthiness Release for a Government conducted flight test. Successful completion of First Article Test will be required for the display production.</p>
<p>The CHMD is a system that displays symbology to the Army aviator during both day and night flight operations. The CHMD, combined with head tracking, will increase the pilot's situational awareness (SA) by allowing the pilot to see critical flight symbology while keeping the eyes focused outside the cockpit during both normal flight and degraded visual environment (DVE) conditions. The full set of Air Soldier CHMD requirements is contained in Detail Specification, Item Specification for the Air Soldier Common Helmet Display, AVNS-DTL-10868 (attached). This requirement also includes the delivery of logistic data to support training and provisioning and if applicable, repair of hardware items.</p>
<p>This requirement will be procured through full and open competition. The RFP will require submission of supporting technical/qualification data to show the offeror's compliance with the CHMD specification. The final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of technical, price, past performance and other evaluation factors as described in the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit a proposal in response to the solicitation when it is issued. The anticipated award date is July 2017.</p>
<p>Contractors shall not contact any other Government personnel regarding this notice other than the individual designated above.</p>
<p>Contacting any Government personnel other than the individual designated above may result in an organizational conflict of interest (OCI) and may result in a contractor being excluded from the competition and consideration for award.</p>

<p>This is a synopsis of a proposed action to procure approximately 1000 Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) (1553 bus card); NSN: 5998-01-469-8969, of Northrop Grumman Systems' part number 32-107955, part of AN/APR-39A(V)4 in accordance with FAR 5.201. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Government does not own or have access to a complete technical data package defining the manufacture and acceptance testing of the 1553 bus card, nor can it make it available to any entity. Only the original manufacturer, Northrop Grumman Systems, Rolling Meadows, IL, has the complete technical data package. There is no reasonable expectation of receiving offers from at least two or more Small Businesses offering the domestic product of different Small Business concerns and the waiver of non-manufacturer rule does not apply so this acquisition will not be a set-aside. This announcement should not be construed as a solicitation announcement, invitation for bids, request for quotations, or a request for proposals. The POC for this synopsis can be reached at <a href="mailto:Karlene.smith@dla.mil">Karlene.smith@dla.mil</a>.</p>

Our market research suggests that Raytheon is the sole approved source capable of providing these 101 source controlled (AMSC B), source restricted (AMSC C) or code &amp; part number (AMSC D) National Stock Numbers (NSNs). </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: black; mso-themecolor: text1">SPRBL1-15-D-0017 is a nine (9) year Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract providing for the support of Depot Level Repairable (DLR) and consumable spare parts as well as repair and engineering services provided by Raytheon that are associated with sole-source Raytheon manufactured system components. The contract was awarded on 28 September 2015. The period of performance includes a six (6) year base period followed by one (1), three (3) year re-determinable option period. The contract maximum ceiling is $495.6M.

<DESC>This Market Survey is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management
System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.

1. Introduction/Purpose

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking interest from industry participants capable of designing and building Offshore Automation Systems Replacement that will need to support Terminal, En Route and procedural separation (Oceanic) functionality. This market survey is issued for the purposes of determining the viability of alternative solutions based on the high level requirements located in Attachment 1, Market Survey Submission Requirements and Instructions. The FAA Air Traffic Organizations (ATO) mission is to provide safe, secure and efficient air traffic services to commercial, private and military customers operating in the National Airspace System (NAS). The automation systems currently in use at the four offshore facilities, consisting of Anchorage (ZAN) Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), Honolulu Control Facility (HCF) (ZHN), Guam (ZUA) Center Radar Approach Control Facility (CERAP), and San Juan (ZSU) CERAP, need to be replaced with a modern, standardized and scalable NAS platform(s). The offshore facilities currently use a common Surveillance Data Processor (SDP) and site specific Flight Data Processors (FDP) configurations to conduct Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations.  Facilities are able to configure the SDP system functionality based on the type of Air Traffic Services (ATS) that are  required; En Route (includes Offshore/Oceanic procedural control and separation) or Terminal .  The current FDP at the facilities are unique configurations that supply flight data to the facilities with a mixture of FDP equipment and Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO) devices.  

The Offshore Automation System Replacement program is an effort designed to provide automation system solution, or solutions, to the aforementioned offshore facilities that addresses both near-term and future Next Generation Air Traffic System (NextGen) needs, while taking advantage of the benefits of standard platforms, training programs and support. The program plans to utilize Air Traffic Control (ATC) platforms that will meet the air traffic requirements of each offshore site. This program will need to support Terminal, En Route, and procedural separation (Oceanic) functionality and will provide value by implementing a standardized and scalable NAS platform at the offshore facilities to address several shortcomings of the legacy system. The Offshore Automation Systems Replacement program Initial Operating Capability (IOC) is expected between FY 2019-2021. The program will also consider dependencies on key programs being deployed according to their current schedules.  

Operational and technical descriptions for each site and high level draft requirements for the Offshore Automation Systems Replacement are provided in Attachment 1, Market Survey Submission Requirements and Instructions.

The 200 mile restriction will be verified by using the shortest driving distance from the Nashville VAMC to a contractor s office from which the majority of the design services will be performed. This mileage restriction will be calculated using the following link: https://www.google.com/maps/dir//''/@36.1392717,-86.8070458,15z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x886466a250acfd41:0x894073a6a106b8d8!2m2!1d-86.8044571!2d36.1417423.
If said contractor s office is more than the 200 mile driving distance restriction to the Nashville VAMC, the contractor s SF330 package will not be evaluated by the source selection evaluation board (SSEB) and will not be considered for award. This mileage restriction is in compliance with VAAR 805.207.
Contractors are required to place the address that must be utilized by the contracting officer on the first page (cover page) of the SF 330 package. No other address will be utilized when determining said mileage restriction.
Description: The TVHS VA Medical Center is seeking professional architect/engineering firms to  Reconfigure Sterile Processing Supply Scope Processing .  This project will require architectural and construction period services to prepare complete contract drawings, specifications, technical reports, and cost estimates, including (optional) services throughout construction to completely reconfigure and renovate approximately 1000 square feet of the Sterile Processing Service (SPS) space in the Basement of Building 1 at the Nashville Campus of the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System, 1310 24th Ave South, Nashville, TN 37212. The  Reconfigure Sterile Processing Supply Scope Processing  Project will reconfigure the space and effect adjacent spaces provide proper scope processing flow from contaminated to clean spaces, as well as scope storage. Entries into the adjacent Decontamination and Supply Receiving will be affected and reconfigured.
Professional disciplines include, but are not limited to architectural, mechanical, fire protection, plumbing, electrical, communications, access controls, and industrial hygiene.
It is the intent of the Department of Veterans Affairs to have the A/E fully survey, investigate, and document the existing space, and all systems necessary in order to gain the knowledge and insight necessary to prepare quality, accurate documents in a professional manner to accomplish the following:
Reconfiguration will absorb unused rooms and adjacent offices to maximize space, increase efficiency, and optimize processes to provide proper scope processing flow from contaminated to clean spaces, as well as proper scope storage.
Project will provide proper access to the Automated Endoscopic Reprocessor (AER- Medivator Scope Washer). 
Project will reconfigure entries into the adjacent Decontamination and Supply Receiving areas for seamless integration of newly renovated areas for Scope Processing. 
Improve reliability, stability, monitoring, control, and energy efficiency. Integrate native BACnet Direct Digital Controls (DDC) controls with existing Alerton or Honeywell DDC frontend systems.

<p>Introduction<br />The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases. The discovery and development of an AIDS vaccine remains among the highest research priorities of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and is a principal mission of NIAID's Division of AIDS (DAIDS). To support this mission, NIAID has provided high-quality, novel, and targeted reagents, assays and services for investigators engaged in AIDS vaccine-related research, including NIAID-funded grantees and contractors, other NIH-funded researchers, and investigators supported through various Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). These services are provided through this contract by investigator request and NIAID staff approval. The current contract for this work is entitled " Reagent Resource Support Program for AIDS Vaccine Development" and the incumbent contractor is Quality Biological Inc., contract number HHSN272201100023C.</p>
<p>Description <br />The purpose of the proposed contract will be to produce, procure, store, ship, and maintain an up-to-date inventory of high-quality reagents and assays in support of preclinical and clinical AIDS vaccine research.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall: 1) procure, purify, and test reagents, including, for example: viral proteins and peptides, virus stocks, monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, topical microbicides, vaccine vectors, vaccine adjuvants and cytokines, and any additional reagents deemed necessary for the NIAID DAIDS Vaccine Research Program; 2) perform genetic cloning and sequencing; 3) acquire the needed reagents, assays, and/or services used to evaluate AIDS vaccine safety and immunogenicity; 4) analyze all reagents for purity and integrity, and provide for their quality control and assurance; and 5) provide for receipt and inventory tracking, storage, maintenance, and distribution of all reagents.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus six (6) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of seven (7) years, beginning on or about January 7, 2018. The requirement will be for the delivery of 2.00 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 7).</p>
<p>In addition to the above functions and services to be provided for the Base period, the Government may exercise, at its discretion, Options for additional level of effort to accommodate significant increases in work. These Options are defined as follows:</p>
<p>Option 1 - 6: Extend the Term of the Contract: The Government may exercise options to extend the term of the contract beyond the Base period (Year 1), annually, for a total contract period of up to 7 years of the performance. The total period of performance resulting from the base period plus all potential Term Options is 7 years. Assume that the scope and types of activities as outlined for the Base Period (Year 1 of the contract) would be continued for each succeeding annual contract period.</p>
<p>Options 7-20 Increased Level of Effort: The Government may exercise options for increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand. Up to Two (2) Options per year may be exercised during years 1 through 7 of contract performance. Should the Government elect to exercise these Options, the Contractor shall provide an additional 1.0 FTE for each option exercised. The period of performance of an Option for Increased Services will not exceed the term of the base year or the Option year in which the Option is exercised.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) Orlando intends to award a delivery order under the Boeing Corporate Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00019-16-G-0001 to Boeing Defense Space and Security, Training Systems and Government Services (Boeing) for the development, integration and delivery of the Tactical Operational Flight Trainer (TOFT) H14 System Configuration Set (SCS)/Operational Flight Program (OFP) software for the Fleet inventory of 23 F/A-18E/F and EA-18G TOFTs at Naval Air Weapons Station (NAWS) China Lake, CA, Naval Air Station (NAS) Lemoore, CA, NAS Oceana, VA, NAS Whidbey Island, WA, and Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Iwakuni, Japan.
  Boeing has been the sole designer, developer, weapons system integrator, and producer of the F/A-18A-F and EA-18G aircraft.  Boeing created the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft systems software and modifies the aircrafts SCS to include OFP software.  Boeing provided software for design, engineering, simulations, and operational evaluation that were used in the development of the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft.  These modified subsystem models are used to develop and test not only the SCS/OFP, but each SCS/OFPs associated sensor models, and are essential to the continued development and support of the F/A-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft and training systems.  Only Boeing possesses the unique capabilities to meet aircraft concurrency.
  Award to any other contractor would result in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that would not be recovered through competition and would create unacceptable delays in fulfilling F/A-18E/F and EA-18G mission training requirements.

This is a notice that outlines the Governments intent to contract on a sole source basis with Boeing. However, interested sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. Any response to this notice must show clear and convincing evidence that competition would be advantageous to the Government. In doing so, interested sources must submit detailed technical capabilities, ability to obtain FA-18E/F and EA-18G aircraft elements and simulation technical data, and any other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the needs of the Government.
 Detailed capabilities must be submitted by email to Ms. Jessica Roach (Jessica.Roach@navy.mil) in an electronic format that is compatible with Word 2003, no later than 30 Nov 2016. All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government. Responses shall be limited to no more than TEN (10) pages. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This synopsis is not to be considered a request for quotations or proposals. No solicitation document is available.
 No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the Government. If no affirmative written response is received, the Contract for the F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G H14 SCS/OFP upgrades will be awarded without further notice prior to award.

This acquisition is being pursued on a sole source basis under statutory authority of 10 U.S.C.(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 (only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements).

The goal of the HCHV Contracted Residential Services (CRS) is to rapidly stabilize Veterans' medical, mental health, substance abuse and other psychosocial problems in order to place Veterans in other appropriate transitional or permanent housing within 30 to 90 days, but no more than 180 days. Contractor will provide rapid placement of VA-referred Veterans in a safe, residential treatment setting while addressing Veterans' complex needs through on-site treatment case management services.  There are two distinct levels of HCHV Contracted Residential Services that will be provided for under the proposed contract-
1.	Low Demand Safe Haven (LDSH): LDSH are 24-hour staffed transitional residences with private or semi-private accommodations that target the population of hard-to-reach, chronically homeless Veterans with mental illness and/or substance use problems who require a low-demand environment. The low-demand or non-intrusive environment is designed to re-establish trust and motivate the homeless Veteran to seek needed treatment services and transitional and permanent housing options. Lengths of stay in LDSH programs are typically 180 days with the option to extend based on clinical need. Up to 20 beds with a capacity to flex up to 4 female beds is the requirement for LDSH.
2.	Contracted Emergency Residential Services (CERS): CERS programs target and prioritize homeless Veterans transitioning from literal street homelessness, Veterans being discharged from institutions, including those in need of medical respite, and Veterans who recently became homeless and require safe and stable living arrangements while they seek permanent housing. CERS Programs, either directly or through linkage with community and other VA services, provide low demand time-limited services such as supporting mental health stabilization, Substance Use Disorder (SUD) treatment services, enhancement of independent living skills, vocational training, and employment services. Emphasis is placed on referral and placement in permanent housing or longer term residential programs utilizing VA and/or community resources. Lengths of stay in CERS typically range from 30 to 90 days with the option to extend based on clinical need. Up to 25 beds with a capacity to flex up to 4 female beds is the requirement for CERS.
General qualifications: the Contracted Residential Services facility must be licensed to operate and be located within Philadelphia, PA.  The facility must have experienced personnel onsite to provide services.  The facility must be capable of passing an initial inspection conducted by select personnel from the CMCVAMC. The offeror will be required to submit a small business subcontracting plan that is acceptable to the Government.

<p>Responses may be by electronic media sent to the email address provided herein. A statement of the ability of the respondent to deliver the above items in the desired quantities shall be sufficient to comprise the response.</p>
<p>The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only. This is not a request for a formal proposal of any kind. The US Government is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>The Government will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.</p>
<p>The Government may in the future decide to pursue a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. If an interested responder qualifies for one of these classifications, please note that on the response.</p>
<p>All responses to this market survey must be received 30 November 2016 at 4:00 PM CST. Please include the announcement number in your e-mail.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY for novel fabric materials that may be suitable for use in a tropical wet environment and are capable of meeting the basic requirements described below. This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB). It is a market research tool being used to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources for planning purposes only. Responses to this notice are not considered as offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information presented or the use of any such information.
<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is requesting information on novel materials that may be used in a Jungle Combat Clothing Ensemble. Materials may include novel fiber types/blends, weave constructions and functional finishes. These materials may have potential use as base fabrics, design features and/or reinforcement patches within a Jungle Combat Clothing Ensemble. A separate RFI&nbsp;has been&nbsp;posted for&nbsp;commercial material (W911QY-17-LtWeightMatl-Commercial).</p>
<p>The objective of this RFI is to determine the availability in the&nbsp;marketplace of materials that may be suitable for use in a tropical wet environment, where temperatures range from 75 to 95&deg;F and relative humidity ranges from 75% to 100%. Further considerations are as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; Soldier priorities for a uniform are quick-drying followed by, durable, breathable and lighter weight. <br />&bull; Materials of interest are novel woven, knit, mesh, spacer, auxetic and phase-change materials that meet Soldier priorities. Materials must be machine washable. <br />&bull; Attributes such as no melt/no-drip materials and vector protection (via permethrin treatment or other modes of action) are required. Fabrics should contain an EPA-approved treatment (e.g. Permethrin, etc.) that is in accordance with EPA-approved levels to protect against vector-borne diseases.<br />&bull; Desired material durability and other performance attributes are listed in Table 1.<br />&bull; Fabrics should have the ability to be camouflage printed via rotary screen printing or dyed, depending on the intended application.<br />&bull; According to Soldiers, the 50/50 Nylon/Cotton rip stop uniform (~6.5 osy) takes more than 4 hours to dry in a tropical wet environment. A more acceptable range in a hot, humid environment (i.e., 75-95&deg;F and 70-100% RH) is 1-2 hours.</p>
<p>REQUESTED INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Vendors who believe they have materials capable of meeting the above requirements are requested to submit a short (no more than 5 pages total per sample) summary, including Company name and address, point of contact with phone number, DUNS number, CAGE Code and a statement regarding any small business designation (if applicable), by the date and to the address noted below. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 313310 and the small business size is 1,000 employees. Responses should include</p>
<p>1. A description of the tropical combat materials being submitted or developed, a summary of the technical approaches taken to meet the performance requirements of this RFI, and the ability to scale up production if required.<br />2. Estimated cost per linear yard.<br />3. Test data demonstrating the performance of the material being submitted as it compares to the technical requirements of this RFI in Table 1 (attached).<br />4. Samples equivalent to a minimum of one (1) linear yard of material (in any color) with written assurance that the shade, color fastness and spectral reflectance requirements can be met if printed in a multi-color earth tone camouflage pattern. Submitted materials must be permethrin or etofenprox treated by an EPA-registered facility.<br />5. A material description including fiber blend percentages and Berry compliance documentation (all textile-based technology products-all materials and manufacturing-must comply with Berry Amendment Restrictions, per DFARS 252.225-7012).</p>
<p>Respondents may submit up to five (5) different fabric candidates, but should clearly identify the advantages/disadvantages of each. Any finishes added to the fabric should be identified in the response. Respondents should clearly identify any areas where the samples do not meet the attribute thresholds in Table 1 and discuss tradeoffs.</p>
<p>The submissions may be used by the Government in formulating a program to assess the performance of the submitted materials and design concepts for functionality in a tropical environment. While there is no guarantee that a subsequent solicitation will be issued and/or a contract awarded, currently, it is the Government's interest to explore the feasibility of procuring lighter weight textile materials for use in tropical uniforms.</p>
<p>Respondents are requested to provide information and sample materials by Wednesday, 29 March 2016/3:00PM Eastern Standard Time.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are to be sent to Ms. Melynda Perry, NSRDEC, ATTN: RDNS-SEW-TDT, 15 General Greene Ave., Natick, MA 01760-5019. This notice is for information and sample materials only.

<DESC>MK 45 MOD 1 Electric Primer (MK 45 Primer)
<p>Solicitation Number: W52P1J-16-R-0068</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), on behalf of the Project Director Joint Products, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is issuing a sources sought notice in an effort to identify capable sources for the production and delivery of the MK 45 Mod 1 Electric Primer Assemblies, NSN: 1390-00-877-5245, P/N: 2434755. The MK 45 Primer is an Electrically Primed Igniter that houses the ignition element. The Government anticipates that one Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) production contract with 5 available ordering periods will be awarded.</p>
<p>Item Description: The MK 45 Primer is an Electrically Primed Igniter. The current design consists of a zinc-plated steel primer stock and 20.25 inch long zinc-plated steel blast tube. The primer stock houses the ignition element; containing the electrode, platinum/iridium bridge wire, normal lead styphnate and nitrocellulose ignition charge, and black powder booster charge. The ignition element and stock is assembled with the primer blast tube, which is loaded with black powder and sealed with paper cups and purple lacquer. The metal components are zinc-plated steel, copper and brass. The approximate dimensions of the final assembly are 21.5 inches long and 1.25 inches in diameter. The Navy utilizes the MK 45 Mod 1 Electric Primer Assembly in the 5"/54 caliber Naval Gun system. This primer is a component of the MK 67 Mod 3 Propelling Charge for 5 inch naval gun ammunition and is threaded into the base of a propelling charge case. The propelling charge is initiated by an electrical impulse to the MK 45 Mod 1 Primer igniting a chemical composition which ignites a series of black powder charges. The flame from the main black powder charge is vented through holes in the primer tube that then ignites the main propellant within the cartridge case. This item is used in an automatic feed system so reliability to performance is crucial.</p>

<DESC>UNCLASSIFIED: Distribution A - Approved for public release<br />Market Survey Questionnaire<br />For<br />Light Armored Vehicles<br />Energy Attenuating (EA) Seats
<p><br />GENERAL INFORMATION: The U.S. Government appreciates the time and effort taken to respond to this survey. Please note that any information you submit in response to this questionnaire that is protected by law, will not be released. Any responses to this request for information are subject to the following:</p>
<p>1. Clearly and conspicuously mark qualifying data with the restrictive legend (all caps) "PROPRIETARY" with any explanatory text, so that the U.S. Government is clearly notified of what data needs to be appropriately protected.</p>
<p>2. In marking such data, please take care to mark only those portions of the data or materials that are truly proprietary (over breadth in marking inappropriate data as "PROPRIETARY" may diminish or eliminate the usefulness of your response - see item 6 below). Use circling, underscoring, highlighting or any other appropriate means to indicate those portions of a single page which are to be protected.</p>
<p>3. The U.S. Government is not obligated to protect unmarked data. Additionally, marked data that is already in the public domain or in the possession of the U.S. Government or third parties, or is afterward placed into the public domain by the owner or another party through no fault of the U.S. Government will not be protected once in the public domain. Data already in the possession of the U.S. Government will be protected in accordance with the U.S. Government's rights in the data.</p>
<p>4. Proprietary data transmitted electronically, whether by physical media or not, whether by the respondent or by the U.S. Government, shall contain the "PROPRIETARY" legend, with any explanatory text, on both the cover of the transmittal e-mail and at the beginning of the file itself. Where appropriate for only portions of an electronic file, use the restrictive legends &lsquo;PROPRIETARY PORTION BEGINS:" and "PROPRIETARY PORTION ENDS."</p>
<p>5. In any reproductions of technical data or any portions thereof subject to asserted restrictions, the U.S. Government shall also reproduce the asserted restriction legend and any explanatory text.</p>
<p>6. The U.S. Government sometimes uses support contractors in evaluating responses. Consequently, responses that contain proprietary information may receive only limited or no consideration since the Respondent's marking of data as "PROPRIETARY" will preclude disclosure of same outside the U.S. Government and therefore will preclude disclosure to these support contractors assisting the evaluation effort. The U.S. Government will use its best efforts to evaluate those responses that contain proprietary information without using support contractors consistent with the resources available.</p>

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice(SS)/Request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes, and is NOT&nbsp;an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or request for proposal. NO solicitation is currently available. This notice does NOT constitute a committment by the Government. The Government will NOT pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to this sources sought. Any costs associated with this sources sought response submittal are solely&nbsp;at the interested parties' expense. Not responding to the RFT does not preclude participation in any future requirement. The information will be used to assist determination of sources capable of an electronic surveillance and electronic attack systems ahead of an upcoming test. The test event is fixed, therefore no late submissions will be accepted.
<p>Response Instructions</p>
<p>Responses should be emailed to MAJ Mike Hudson, Michael.l.hudson70.mil@mail.mil/ and Scott Beaudry, Scott.a.beaudry.ctr@mail.mil at the REF by the response date listed above.</p>
<p>Background and Scope</p>
<p>Communications monitoring systems exist in spaces across industry and in militaries around the world. Spectrum analyzing tools also exist in wide numbers and with broad capabilities. Few ruggedized, tactical Electronic Surveillance (ES) systems exist that operate in the frequency bands of interest to the Army and are capable of rapidly presenting a codified picture of the Electromagnetic Spectrum (EMS) to Army Electronic Warfare personnel in tactical situations.</p>
<p>This request is for an ES/EA system that can be carried by a single Soldier. It should have fast and broad scanning capabilities so the operator can rapidly see and analyze activity across wide portions of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum to assess all relevant communications signals in a militarily relevant area up to 6 GHz. It should also have the capability to concentrate its processing capacity at smaller portions of the EMS as missions may dictate. In other words, a broad spectrum analyzer that can also do high quality signals interrogation, analyze and location right up to, but not including, specific capabilities that only SIGINT personnel are able to employ.</p>
<p>This system is envisioned as multi-channel transceiver in a backpack with applicable amplifiers and antennas to address the relevant RF bands where near peer militaries and non-state terrorist organizations can operate in the EMS. The weight limitation is 30 lbs. for the base unit that can be used while on a Soldiers back and on the move. It is expected that separate antennas, amplifiers and batteries (not necessarily carried by the same Soldier) will be useful to better address specific capabilities in specific RF bands in both receive and transmit modes. It is understood that certain capabilities (perhaps direction finding, jamming) will necessitate temporarily fixed antennas emplaced at safe distances from personnel while in use.</p>
<p>The REF is seeking to find existing products or technologies that can be packaged into a backpack to enable rapid detection, identification and denial of RF communications across militarily relevant areas and ranges.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to assist in the selection of available products at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) six (6) and greater ahead of an upcoming test event. TRL 6 is defined as representative model or prototype system tested in a relevant environment.</p>
<p>Vendors who are able to attend a test event for the month of March- June 2017 within the State of Arizona, and are able to perform all of the parameters set forth below, are asked to forward supporting information back to the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF). The test will be fairly comprehensive and vendors will be asked to find, analyze and defeat multiple signals across a wide area in compressed timelines in order to assess the military relevance of the equipment.</p>
<p>Requested Information:</p>
<p>The submitted documentation and content becomes the property of the United States Government and will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with the documentation submitted under this request. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. Although solicitation terminology may appear in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.</p>
<p>This notice is part of Government market research. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company or industry proprietary information contained in responses should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, so that publicly releasable and proprietary information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one source to establish the capability and requirements for any future acquisition, so as to inadvertently restrict competition.</p>
<p>All information should be submitted by email to addresses provided above. If unable to submit via email, please advise CPT Hudson by email and then forward paper copies/material to:</p>
<p>MAJ Mike Hudson / Scott Beaudry<br />10236 Burbeck Road<br />Ft. Belvoir, VA. 22060-5852</p>
<p>Responses which do not clearly and completely address the below requested information and series of questions will be considered as submitted for general informational purposes only, and not considered a demonstration of intent to in future test events.</p>
<p>Please provide the following information: <br />&bull; Business Name:<br />&bull; Business Address and webpage (if applicable):<br />&bull; CAGE Code:<br />&bull; Point of Contact Name and Contact Information:<br />&bull; Description of the specific product/technology being offered for consideration including:<br />o Description of overarching vision for the effort<br />o Ability of system to be operated by a Soldier, regardless of military occupational specialty.<br />o TRL of system.<br />o System capability to just ES/EA or combined.<br />o Any level of automation in the system to perform both capabilities<br />o Type of system.<br />o All information available considering Soldier Safety.<br />o Table comparing vendor capabilities against all requested capabilities and specifications (even if not able to meet all specifications) provided within this RFI; prefer table format for comparison against desired capabilities and specifications <br />o Has your company performed this type of effort or similar effort (to include size and complexity) either currently or in the past to another Government agency or Non-Government customer? YES or NO <br />o Description of similar efforts ongoing or completed as such efforts map to the requested capabilities and specifications within this RFI; include identification of the associated government sponsor(s)<br />o References with POC information to include name, organization, contract number, phone, and email of customers (preferably government) using comparable products<br />o Availability of spare parts and support services<br />o Timeline<br />&bull; Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) Cost of system</p>

<CONTACT>Erik C. Whitehill, Contracting Officer, Phone 321-867-5504, Email Erik.C.Whitehill@nasa.gov
<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is hereby soliciting information about potential sources capable of integrating and launching U-Class payload dispensers in the FY 18 - FY 21 timeframe (June 2018 - December 2020) to a Polar Orbit (85 degrees to 102 degrees inclination). A U class payload is a type of miniaturized space research satellite that typically uses commercial, off-the-shelf electronic components. The U class payloads flown by NASA are primarily developed by a variety of educational and Governmental organizations. The U class payload is a form factor of 10cm X 10cm X 10cm.<br />
<p>NASA/KSC is seeking capability statements from all interested parties including Small, Small Disadvantaged (SDB), 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Veteran Owned (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned (SD-VOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) businesses, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU)/Minority Institutions (MI) for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition for this potential acquisition. The Government reserves the right to consider a Small, 8(a), Woman-owned (WOSB), Service Disabled Veteran (SD-VOSB), or HUBZone business set-aside based on responses hereto. The NAICS code for this requirement is 336414 with a size standard of 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>The proposed service shall be capable of delivering up to 72U in the form factor of 1U, 2U, 3U, 6U and 12U over the identified time period. The service may be provided on a manifested commercial or government launch service. The U class payloads require release to a Polar Orbit orbit with an altitude that allows the U class payloads to meet NASA Orbital Debris Policy (NPR 8715.6A). The U class payloads will not have a go/no-go or "hold" authority during countdown. The Contractor will be responsible for integrating the U class dispensers onto the launch vehicle and providing telemetry confirmation that the dispenser has released the U class payloads. If necessary, the KSC Launch Services Program (LSP) integration Contractor will perform the installation of the U class payloads into the Government provided dispenser.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that any procurement resulting from this request for information will consider domestic sources only as Public Law 105-303, 51 U.S.C 50131, et. seq., states that the Federal Government shall acquire space transportation services from United States commercial providers whenever such services are required in the course of its activities.</p>
<p>The launch service provider will be responsible for obtaining a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) license as a commercial procurement is anticipated, as well as securing any necessary range assets and approvals for the launch.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service. It is the potential offeror's responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>PURPOSE OF NOTICE:</strong><br />The purpose of this announcement is to identify and assess the availability of small business concerns with the requisite capabilities and qualifications to operate and maintain the NINDS Center for Clinical Research Resources which provides scientific and technical support toward the conduct of NINDS-sponsored clinical research in the areas of Quality Assurance/Quality Control clinical trial monitoring, statistical and methodological support, clinical data acquisition and archiving support and common data element development support for neurological diseases and disorders. <br /><br />The envisioned contract award is a follow-on requirement to the current National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Center for Clinical Trial Resources currently being performed under contract HHSN271201200034C at the EMMES Corporation.<br /><br />The NINDS is seeking Small Business Capability Statements at this time in order to determine if this future requirement can be set-aside exclusively for small business concerns.</p>
<p><strong>THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS</strong>, and if your business concern is NOT a small business, there is no need to respond to this announcement. Once a determination is made regarding the suitability of this future requirement for a small business set-aside (or an open competition to include both large and small businesses), a separate Pre-Solicitation Announcement would be issued in advance of the release of a Request for Proposals.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong>:<br />The NINDS Office of Clinical Research (OCR) is charged with ensuring the highest quality of each NINDS-funded clinical research project and compliance with DHHS/NIH/NINDS regulations regarding human subject protection and safety monitoring. To ensure the highest quality product and most efficient use of resources, OCR has established a programmatic requirement for clinical research-related scientific and technical support in the form of the proposed Center. The NINDS Center for Clinical Research Resources is to provide scientific and technical support toward the conduct of NINDS-sponsored clinical research in the areas of Quality Assurance/Quality Control clinical trial monitoring, statistical and methodological support, clinical data acquisition and archiving support and common data element development support in the area of neurological diseases and disorders.</p>
<p><strong>NAICS CODE and APPLICABLE SMALL BUSINESS QUALIFICATION</strong>:<br />Based on the technical and scientific nature of the expertise required and the work to be performed for the subject requirement in support of clinical research in the Neurosciences, the work requirement is best classified by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541712 "Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)". Therefore, the small business size standard for this announcement is 1,000 or fewer employees. Furthermore, per FAR 19.001, a small business concern means any business entity organized for profit (even if its ownership is in the hands of a nonprofit entity) with a place of business in the United States or its outlying areas and makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes and/or use of American products, material and/or labor, etc..</p>
<p>Please note that in order to qualify as an eligible small business for purposes of a small business set-aside (where large businesses would be excluded from competing), at least 50% of the direct labor cost must be "in-house". Specifically, FAR 52.219-14, "Limitations on Subcontracting," states that "at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern." Submitted Capability Statements must address how the business meets the applicable size standard.</p>
<p>Small business concerns that meet the applicable NAICS code size standard and who believe that they have the capabilities, capacity, experience and qualifications to provide the full range of services described for the NINDS Center for Clinical Research Resources are asked to address each of the areas described in the Information Requested section below as part of a submitted Capability Statement. Please ensure that your response is complete and sufficiently detailed to assist in our evaluation as to whether or not this requirement could be set-aside for small business participation only. <strong>If responses indicate a reasonable expectation of obtaining competitive offers from two or more responsible and capable small business concerns, the anticipated Request for Proposals may be set-aside for small business participation only and a future Pre-Solicitation Notice for this requirement would indicate this determination</strong>.</p>
<p>Responses to this announcement must address how your business meets the applicable NAICS code size standard and must include the respondents' DUNS number; organization name; organization address; point of contact, including title, address, telephone and e-mail address; and your current small business size status (e.g. small, small disadvantages business, HUBZone small business, woman-owned small business, 8(s), etc.) pursuant to the applicable NAICS code specified above (NAICS 541712).</p>

This is needed to reduce unnecessary proposal preparation work for efforts that may not be of interest to the Navy, or because of the uncertainty of program budgets. Evaluations will be conducted by a panel of government experts using the following criteria: Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and potential contributions to the Navy Propulsion, Power and Energy objectives to include (1) relevance to the stated technology areas of interest; (2) anticipated operational military (or commercial, if applicable) utility; (3) ability of proposed system/study to be rapidly ready for transition; (4) suitability for transition to Navy systems; and (5) projected affordability of transitioning the technology to the fleet Other evaluation criteria, of lesser importance but equal to each other are; The offeror's capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives and the realism and reasonableness of cost, including proposed cost sharing. No further criteria will be used in the evaluation. The technical and cost information will be evaluated at the same time. Further details on these criteria are contained in the aforementioned Guide. Selection for award will be based on the potential benefit to the Government weighed against the cost of the proposals, in view of the availability of government funds. Cost plus fixed fee, cost sharing, and cost contracts are anticipated. Other types of contracts may be proposed, but offerors are advised that the Government is under no obligation to accept. Specific reporting requirements cited on the Contract Data Requirements List (DD1423) shall be specified within each contract award. At a minimum all offerors will be required to submit the following reports: a) Detailed Planning Report; b) Progress Report; c) Financial Reports; d) Test Plans; e) Program Reviews; f) Presentation Material; and g) Final Report. Proposal submission process, format and content, as well as deliverable items are delineated in the above mentioned NAVAIR Guide. Initial proposals or White Papers (WP) should not exceed 30 pages in length, including a cost estimate. BRIEFNESS IS DESIRABLE - WPs RANGING FROM A FEW PAGES TO 15 PAGES ARE THE NORM. Cost estimates in WPs for stand-alone subsets of effort are encouraged. Offerors of those WPs found to be consistent with the intent of the BAA will be invited to submit a formal cost and technical proposal. One original, and later, if invited, of each formal cost and technical proposal are to be submitted. WPs and Proposals shall be submitted to: Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Highway 547, Bldg 120-180, Code 2.5.2.4, Attn: Jillian Kohler, jillian.kohler@navy.mil , Contract Specialist, Lakehurst, NJ 08733. One soft copy shall be submitted to </span><a href="mailto:jillian.kohler@navy.mil"><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">jillian.kohler@navy.mil</span></a><span style="FONT-FAMILY: ">. There will be no formal Request For Proposal (RFP) or other Solicitation issued with regard to this requirement. The Navy reserves the right to select for award any, all, part of, or none of the responses received and intends to incrementally fund any resultant contract(s), depending on available funding. The BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Government to pay any proposal preparation costs for responding to this BAA. Responses should be forwarded at no cost to the Government. The cost of preparing proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost as specified in FAR 31.205-18.

<p>Submit this information to Kent Bernard, Contract Specialist, via email to Kent.R.Bernard@usace.army.mil. Your response to this notice must be received on or before 2:00 PM PST on November 28, 2016.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The two-phase selection procedures are described in FAR 36.3. The contracting officer with involvement of the PDT shall make a determination that the design-build procedures are appropriate, using the criteria delineated in FAR 36.301 (b). If appropriate, the contracting officer should use the two-phase selection procedures, unless another design-build acquisition procedure authorized by law is used.<br /><br /><strong><br />Summary of Scope of Work:</strong></p>
<p>NOAA Fisheries and other regional fish managers use Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) Tag data to track fish movement of anadromous species as they go downstream in their outmigration and as they come back upstream heading to their spawning grounds. Information collected can be used to estimate bypass passage rates, run timing, survival and smolt to adult return rates as well as evaluate the effects of project operations. The estimated construction cost limitation (combined design and construction costs) for this project is $6,000,000.00. <br /><br />Currently, spillway bay one functions as the surface passage route at Lower Granite and passes an average of 75% of those fish passing over all eight of the spillway bays. The Corps of Engineers does not have a way to collect PIT Tag data from out migrating juvenile salmonids and steelhead passing over these spillways. Studies six to ten years ago indicated an average of 65% of fish passing the dam on their way downstream passed over the spillway and, as a result, were undetected by existing monitoring systems. In an attempt to collect PIT Tag information from the fish passing over the spillway at Lower Granite Dam, the Corps of Engineers intends to install a monitoring system in spillway bay one.<br /><br />The contractor would design, fabricate, and place a steel bulkhead on the downstream end of the spill bay one deflector. The bulkhead would span from pier to pier across the spill bay (from several feet below the end of deflector (elevation &cong;630 ft) to high tail water elevation (&cong;642 feet). The bulkhead would isolate the construction area in the spill bay from the stilling basin. The bulkhead design would be stamped by a licensed professional engineer. The bulkhead would isolate the work area from about 10-12 feet of water in the stilling basin and would need to seal tightly at the base to minimize leakage into the work area. The contractor may use a barge mounted crane moored in the stilling basin outside the work area to set the bulkhead and support the construction work. Divers may need to assist with bulkhead placement to ensure correct positioning and establish an effective seal between the bulkhead and the existing spillway deflector surface. Once the bulkhead is in place, the area between the steel bulkhead and the spillway surface or the existing spillway piers would be dewatered. Work on the spillway chute and deflector would then be accomplished in the dry. Some water leakage is usually present, so pumping water may be required throughout the construction period.<br /><br />The contractor may use any combination of methods such as saw cutting, drilling, splitting and/or high pressure water blasting to remove some concrete from the face of the existing spillway, exposing the rebar and leaving a roughened surface for placement of the new concrete forming the flatter spillway chute and modified spill deflector. Estimated concrete removal is 150 cy. The removed concrete would be captured and not allowed to fall into the tailrace pool. During concrete cutting/removal operations, all process water and waste material would be collected for treatment and upland disposal. Construction materials or fluids are not allowed to come into contact with Snake River water. The work may include drilling and grouting concrete anchors into the face of the spillway followed by installation of reinforcing steel. The contractor place concrete for the final spillway chute and spill deflector surfaces. The contractor would have to place the concrete within a limited work window, and would be required to demonstrate concrete placement on a sloped surface. All seepage water and other water from construction operations would be removed from the work area for appropriate treatment.</p>
<p>Should the need arise to spill water from other bays during construction, any support barges outside of the dry work area would need to be removed. Depending on levels of spill, construction may continue or be halted depending on the risk to workers in proximity to the river tailrace area.<br /><br />A series of pass-over antennas (GFE) would be installed within the added spillway ogee surface. The antennae project an electromagnetic field up through the ogee concrete surface and spillway flow. PIT Tag data is collected from tagged fish as they pass over the antennas. Multiple antennas would be installed by the contractor and covered with a cap to isolate them from spillway flow during spillway operation. Aluminum shields would be fabricated and installed by the contractor beneath the antenna to isolate their field from magnetic elements in the spillway. If concrete is used; new concrete placement above the antennae requires non-metallic rebar and non-magnetic aggregate. Associated cabling and conduit would be installed in the spillway surface to connect the antennas to a climate controlled shelter provided by the contractor and ground the antennae and shields. The electrical shelter would be located adjacent to spill bay one. Communications cable would include copper antenna cables between the antennas and transceivers (GFE) and fiber optic cables from the transceivers back to the existing data system in the juvenile fish facility. <br /><br />Arbitrary dates for scheduling purposes only.<br /><br />Award DB Contract: April - May 2017<br />In Water Work Window: December 15, 2017 - March 15, 2018<br />Construction complete: March 15, 2018<br />System operational by: April 01, 2018</p>

<div></div>
<div>It should be noted that only members of the NAMC will be able to participate in the RFI. The RFI will be issued to the NAMC&rsquo;s Administrative Agent, National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS), who will then issue the request to the members of the Consortium.

<DESC>BIOPRO POLYETHYLENE IMPLANTS                CONSIGNMENT AGREEMENT FOR VISN6
This request for information (RFI) is posted for market research purposes.  It is a solicitation for sources interested in a consignment agreement to provide BIOPRO POLYETHYLENE IMPLANTS
The Department of Veterans Affairs Mid-Atlantic Health Care Network Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN6) is seeking Contractors that can supply consignment inventory of BIOPRO POYETHYLENE IMPLANTS, in various styles, sizes, and diameters for clinicians providing medical care throughout the VISN 6 Medical Centers. VA attending physicians have the responsibility for determining which products to use and which will best meet the individual patient's medical needs.

VISN6 intends to award an IDC Consignment Agreement to fulfill this requirement.

SPECIFICATIONS
Any subsequent solicitation will include (but is not limited to) the following requirements:
The base contract period for this consignment agreement will be for one year, with four unilateral one-year option periods that may be exercised by the individual medical centers providing this care in VISN 6. The effective date of the consignment shall be 30 days (or sooner upon mutual agreement) after the date of award

Contractor will coordinate with medical center Point of Contact (POC s) and have the requested items stocked at the medical facility. Delivery of products shall be made to the individual VAMCs, at no cost to the Government.

The Government is obligated only to the extent if and when use of the item is made by the Government; except as provided otherwise.  Unused (unopened and undamaged) items shall be returned to the Contractor at the end of the effective period of the agreement, without reimbursement or other expense to the Government

 The term  Products  as used herein shall mean all medical devices which are owned by THE CONTRACTOR but located on Customer s premises (or within customer s control). Each Medical Center is responsible for storing the product to use as indicated by the product s labeling.  Once used, the Medical Center orders a replacement, and is invoiced at the agreed upon price for the replacement product. 
NOTE: The individual Medical Centers will have the responsibility for determining the product(s) that will be utilized from the entire product line.  If a Medical Center determines that a patient s circumstance warrants use of a product that is unavailable from the Contractor product line, the Medical Center will be free to use another contract or if needed, a non-contract source to meet the particular need.
 
The contractor will be required to provide a quarterly report of sales by line item, no later than 15 calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter ending March, June, September and December. The report shall include, but not be limited to, name of the VAMC where implantation is performed, date of implantation, description of item sold, model and serial number of the implanted items, price of each item.  Reports shall be sent electronically to the designated Contracting Officer Representative (COR) responsible for the Consignment Agreement.
Each medical center decides which products best meet the needs of the facility taking into account the contractor s ability to provide service and the physician s medical determination as to which products will best meet the needs of his/her patients. Upon selection of contractor(s), the medical center will provide written notice of its intent to use the contract and its requirements.  Medical centers may change contractors at any time or use more than one contractor. All changes must be approved by the Contracting Officer.

The contractors shall provide an efficient delivery system for the use of a  Consignment Agreement . The delivery system is to meet the needs of medical centers that perform occasional procedures and/or the needs of those that perform significant number of implant procedures.  After award, the Medical Centers will inform the contractor of the chosen method of delivery. Normal delivery will be within two (2) business days. In emergency situations, the contractor must be capable of delivering within a few hours on the same day as per the facility s needs and instructions.  The Government will pay the difference between Normal and Urgent/Emergency freight charges. The implants shall arrive pre-sterilized.  Orders must be received and delivered seven days per week in these situations. All intraocular lenses delivered to VAMC s shall be accompanied by a complete inventory listing to include lot numbers and expiration dates.

<CONTACT>
<DESC>1.	This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement only. This is a market research tool being utilized in accordance with DFARS PGI 206.302-1 to obtain information to be used in a Justification and Approval for Use Other Than Full and Open Competition under the authority at FAR 6.302-1.   The information received will be used within Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) Atlantic to facilitate the decision making process.

2.	This is a survey of the market potential.  This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research and is not restricted to a particular acquisition approach.
 No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any follow-up information requests. Any information submitted by respondents to this notice is strictly voluntary. 

3.	NAVFAC Atlantic intends to issue an out of scope modification to the Architectural and Engineering (A and E) firm that recently completed design work for a project 200 miles from Washington, DC.  The out of scope modification would incorporate changes to design package 3 and provide additional post construction award services, including home office support and additional site visits.   

NAVFAC Atlantic is requesting information on the capabilities of other A and E firms to incorporate changes to design package 3 and provide additional post construction award services, including home office support and additional site visits.
  NAVFAC Atlantic anticipates that using a firm other than the firm that completed the existing design will result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government and result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the Governments requirements.  

It is requested that A and E firms submit to the contracting office a brief capabilities statement package (no more than 4 pages single-sided, singled-spaced, 12 point font minimum) demonstrating the following: 

(1)	Capabilities of the A and E firm with specific information about past design work and post construction award services;
(2)	Estimate of the time and cost associated with analyzing another firms completed design and incorporating changes into that design; and,
(3)	Company profile to include DUNS number, CAGE Code, and statement regarding small business designation and status

The package shall be sent via email: amber.forehand@navy.mil

Package must be received no later than 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on 28 November 2016.
  Questions or comments regarding this notice may be addressed to Amber Forehand-Hughes via electronic mail (email) at amber.forehand@navy.mil.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Sole Source - Pentair
<SOLNBR>RFQ-RT-17-00012
<CONTACT>Wells, Adrianne
<DESC>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in Research Triangle Park (RTP) in Durham, North Carolina intends to award a firm fixed-price contract on a sole source basis to Pentair Aquatic Eco-Systems Inc. in accordance with 13.106-1(b), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

EPAs National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) is engaged in research studying toxicity levels in zebrafish. To perform this research, the laboratory requires a mass embryo production system. Pentair Aquatic Eco-Systems Inc. is the only source that has a mass embryo production system that allows for an adequate in tank housing system, and a tank that includes an observation window. The in tank housing system is required to provide a suitable breeding system that holds at least 660 zebrafish in order to obtain enough fertilized embryos at one time to conduct large scale research studies. The observation window is also an essential requirement because it will allow researchers to provide adequate daily health checks of the large number of fish in the system.  It is very important to be able to remove dead or sick fish from the tank as they are a source of pathogens and parasites for the rest of the fish in the system. 

This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals. This notice of intent is for information purposes only; therefore, no solicitation will result from this announcement. 

All capability statements received within 4 calendar days after publication of this notice (17 November 2016) will be considered by the Government. Responses must be supported with clear and convincing evidence to clearly be able to provide the services outlined and itemized pricing that is sufficient to make a determination that competition is feasible. A request for documentation will not be considered as an affirmative response. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 

Submit capability statements via email (using PDF, MS Word, Excel attachments) to Contracting Officer, Adrianne Wells, at Wells.Adrianne@epa.gov. 

No telephone calls will be accepted.

The NAICS code for this procurement is: 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing

Gray, TSgt, USAF 377 MSG/Contracting Division<br />8500 Gibson Blvd, Bldg 20202 Kirtland AFB, NM 87117<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This is a solicitation for a very low absolute phase noise and amplitude noise RF synthesizer.<br />Looking for the equivalent or better to a modified NoiseXt LNS-18 low noise<br />4 to 18 Gigahertz RF synthesizer with the following modifications:<br />1. NoiseXt part #:LNS-1HZ. This modification gives one millihertz frequency resolution tuning range.</p>
<p>2. NoiseXt part #:LNS-LF-8M. This modification extends the output frequency range downward to eight Megahertz from the LNS-18 standard low frequency of 4GHz. That is, frequency output range of RF synthesizer is 8 Megahertz to 18 Gigahertz.</p>
<p>3. NoiseXt part #:LNS-10M: Internal 10MHz reference, available for external synchronization to synthesizer output.</p>
<p>NoiseXt uses this feature to improve phase noise close to the carrier, specifically it improves phase noise <br />in the frequency region of 1Hz to 10Hz offset from the carrier. This addition lowers the standard LNS-18 phase noise by an additional 15dB. This feature comes with 50 ohm input and output ports.</p>

Therefore, each offer should reflect the Offeror s best terms, both from a cost and technical standpoint.  
Offers
As noted above, the Government will evaluate quotes and may award a contract at any point after review of the offers as submitted, without discussions. Therefore, the initial quote should contain the offeror s best terms from a price and technical standpoint. There will be no public opening of the offers.

Each offer will be independently evaluated.  Offeror s shall include their completed Representations and Certifications as part of the price quote submission or verify that they have completed in www.sam.gov .
Failure to provide all information requested will adversely affect the evaluation of an offer.

The information submitted should be complete and concise, but not overly elaborate.  Reliance on promotional brochures, except where specifically required, is discouraged.  If information is applicable to more than one evaluation criterion, it must be repeated for each criterion where it is applicable.  All commitments made in the quote, if accepted by the Government, will become part of the resultant contract.

If, however, a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of this data, the Government shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the data to the extent provided in the resulting contract. This restriction does not limit the Government's right to use information contained in this data if it is obtained from another source without restriction.

<p>Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) has a requirement for five (5) instrumentation sets that will be used in cardiothoracic surgery procedures.

These items are used in cardiothoracic emergency procedures, changing items or having instruments that are not compatible can cause delay to the surgery and in turn cause harm to the patient. They will create 5 identical sets to be used interchangeable; there is no room for variation with these instruments. <br />2. Items must be coated with super grip polymer to prevent instruments from slipping in the surgeons hand during the procedure. <br />The Request for Quotation (RFQ) number is N0025917Q0034.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) &#9633; Are, &#9633; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) &#9633; Have, &#9633; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane (NSWC Crane) has a requirement for Henkel Hysol brand two part epoxy (EE4183 Resin &amp; HD3561 Hardener). These epoxy kits are the only two part epoxy materials qualified to meet the requirements of NAVSEA Drawings 53711-7521284 and 53711-6556691-1 as required to support fabrication of the TR-343 Transducer and the AN/SQS-56 Stave Cable respectively. A solicitation will be issued pursuant to the procedures in FAR Part 13 for an anticipated Firm-Fixed-Price (FFP) contract. The delivery terms are F.O.B. Destination, Inspection and Acceptance shall be at NSWC Crane. The following items will be procured:</p>
<p>0001 - 450 Gallons, Hysol EE4183 Resin; First delivery of 25 gallons will be delivered two months after contract award. Remaining kits will be delivered in 25 gallon increments every two months thereafter. Each gallon delivered must have a 50% minimum shelf life remaining upon receipt of material at NSWC Crane.</p>

<p>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN intends to award a contract based upon restricted competition to the OEM Henkel, Inc. 825 Cedar Springs Rd Salisbury, NC 28147 or any authorized distributers. This effort restricts competition to a Brand Name Only requirement in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition to the brand name only Hysol epoxy is to avoid roughly $130,000 in cost duplication and prevent as much as five months unnecessary schedule impact for another epoxy to successfully complete the physical, electrical testing as identified by NAVSEA drawings as well as complete a subset of the environmental, shock and vibration testing required by Critical Item Production Fabrication Specifications.</p>

<p>USAID/EASTERN AND SOUTHERN CARIBBEAN <br />SUPERVISORY GENERAL DEVELOPMENT SPECIALIST - GS-15</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>The USAID Mission to the Eastern and Southern Caribbean (USAID/ESC) supports citizen security, climate change, and HIV/AIDS programs throughout the Eastern and Southern Caribbean, a region covering 10 countries and four U.S. Embassies. Since the management transition of USAID/Guyana programs to USAID/ESC in 2012, activities in Guyana and a small number of activities in Suriname have been managed jointly by a technical team spread between Bridgetown, Barbados and Georgetown, Guyana with overall management responsibility held in Bridgetown.</p>
<p>To support these efforts, USAID/ESC requires contracted services of a development assistance professional with strong leadership, teamwork, and management skills to guide USAID activities in Guyana and Suriname. The Supervisory General Development Specialist (S-GDS) would oversee daily management of health, citizen security, and governance activities in Guyana and Suriname. Additionally a key responsibility of the S-GDS would be to coordinate with the U.S. Embassies in Georgetown and Paramaribo and keep the Ambassador and Deputy Chief of Mission informed of USAID programs. The S-GDS would also be responsible for liaising with implementing partners, Government of Guyana and Government of Suriname officials, donors, and other key partners, as appropriate. Finally, the S-DS may periodically be called on to backstop other activities throughout the USAD/ESC area of responsibility (AOR). The S-GDS reports to the USAID Mission Director for USAID/Eastern and Southern Caribbean.</p>
<p>The contract for the Guyana S-GDS position will be for a period of two years with an option to renew contingent on need and funding availability. The position will be based in Georgetown, Guyana and will require regular travel to Suriname and to Bridgetown, Barbados for coordination with USAID/ESC Mission leadership, as well as periodic travel throughout the AOR.</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The contractor is required to possess an extremely high degree of competence, professional maturity, and well-rounded experience in performing a variety of program and project management functions. USAID assistance to Guyana is overseen by USAID/ESC, with everyday management of activities by a team of six USAID staff in Embassy Georgetown (5) and Paramaribo (1). This program requires an experienced manager with well-developed inter-personal skills who is able to function well within a dispersed operational and management structure. The programming and implementation of USAID programs in Guyana and Suriname is complex. As such, the person in this position must have a proven track-record of tact, diplomacy, and ability to manage competing priorities with equanimity and collegiality while achieving expected outcomes</p>
<p>The paramount requirements of the position are a high degree of managerial, analytical, interpersonal, and leadership skills. This position requires a broad knowledge of development assistance management, placing a premium on the incumbent's ability to identify and develop linkages and synergies among various sectors and stakeholders of the program. The Specialist serves as the on-the-ground principle officer and as the key member of Mission staff with responsibility for overseeing and guiding the management of Guyana and Suriname activities. S/he participates directly in Mission policy discussions, and program planning, implementation, and evaluation.</p>
<p>Working under the direct supervision of the Mission Director of USAID/Eastern and Southern Caribbean (or designee), and in coordination with Technical Sector leads, the contractor will participate in and provide substantive input to project implementation, monitoring, and reporting. S/He will also provide active program coordination with counterparts and implementing agencies; NGOs, including those receiving USAID funds and others; international organizations; representatives of the international donor community; Government of Guyana and Suriname counterparts, Department of State, CDC, and Peace Corps; and USAID/Washington cognizant staff.

The S-GDS will be responsible for liaising with USAID/ESC and regional platform staff in the Dominican Republic to ensure proper management and oversight of grants, contracts, and purchase orders that serve as implementation mechanisms for USAID activities and programs in Guyana. The S-GDS will serve as the Mission advocate for program performance impact in all areas of assistance, and will help set priorities for guidance of contractors, grantees, and other activity implementing agencies.</p>
<p>The S-GDS represents the USAID/ESC Mission Director as required, and briefs the US Ambassadors to Guyana and Suriname; Guyana and Suriname government officials; bilateral and multinational donors; private individuals; and others as needs of the USG development assistance program dictates, thus ensuring coordination and achievement of maximum development impact with USAID resources. This requires articulating USAID's strategy for the Eastern and Southern Caribbean, brokering consensus, providing immediate response to fast-breaking developments, and facilitating information flows on critical policy and other issues.</p>
<p>The S-GDS will provide daily supervision to four USAID/ESC staff based in Guyana and one in Suriname.

<p>Additionally, as the day-to-day manager of Guyana's health and citizen security teams, the S-GDS is expected to be fully knowledgeable about these sector areas, as well as fully conversant on programming principles from concept to evaluation. S/he will provide input and support to the vision, strategic direction and leadership to USAID staff overseeing the implementation of all projects/activities in the HIV/AIDS, citizen security and political processes portfolio. The S-GDS will engage closely with senior USG embassy personnel and Government of Guyana officials on USAID programs and activities.

Supervisor provides administrative and policy direction in terms of broadly defined missions or functions and exercises recognized authority. The incumbent has broad responsibility and authority to independently plan, design, and carry out projects and programs. The incumbent has wide but not unlimited discretion and judgment in determining whether to broaden or narrow the scope of tasks. Results of the work are considered technically authoritative. Judgment and extensive experience is required to translate policy direction into program documentation that adheres to Agency policy and represents the Mission's activities comprehensively and accurately.</p>
<p>Guidelines:</p>
<p>Guidelines consist of broadly stated and non-specific public policy statements, Congressional statutes and decisions, etc., that require extensive interpretation. The incumbent uses judgment and ingenuity in determining the intent, and in interpreting and revising existing policy and regulatory guidance. <br /><br />Complexity of Work Environment:</p>
<p>Duties are significantly varied and require many different unrelated processes and methods that are applied to a broad range of problems/situations that require a substantial depth of analysis. Decisions involve largely undefined areas and issues and require extensive probing and analysis to determine the scope of the problem. There are continuing changes in program, unknown phenomena, or conflicting requirements. The work requires originating new techniques, establishing criteria, or developing new information. Assignments are of considerable breadth and intensity and require the participation and support of others. The work requires a continuing effort to establish concepts, theories, or programs, or to resolve unyielding problems.</p>
<p>Scope and Effect of Work Performed:</p>
<p>The work involves isolating and defining unknown conditions, and resolving critical problems. The incumbent is recognized as a known expert to the experts in his/her field. The incumbent resolves disputes that arise when leading experts disagree. The work directly affects the development of major aspects of professional programs of the Eastern and Southern Caribbean Mission. The work involves planning, developing, and carrying out vital programs which are essential to the mission of USAID, or affect substantial numbers of people. Key responsibility of the work is to lead, direct (directly/indirectly), and otherwise affect a substantial number of other professional or technical staff.</p>
<p>Level and Purpose of Contacts:</p>
<p>Contacts include those with high ranking offices (SES/corporate executive and above) at the national and international levels from outside USAID. Officials contacted are relatively inaccessible. Various parties may be unclear as to the role and authority of the other parties. Contacts are conducted under differing ground rules. Contacts typically include counterpart State Department Offices and Bureaus, Embassy counterparts, Congressional staff and legislators, leading representatives of foreign governments, and officials or representatives of large national and international firms and organizations, representatives of the news media, union representative, and U.S., Guyanese, and Surinamese public officials.</p>
<p>The purpose of contacts is to justify, defend, negotiate, and settle matters involving significant or controversial issues among decision makers. The work usually involves active participation in conferences, meetings, hearings, or presentations involving problems or issues of considerable consequence or importance. The people contacted typically have diverse viewpoints, goals, or objectives and therefore the employee is required to achieve a common understanding among the various parties and a satisfactory solution that addresses their various objectives and concerns.</p>
<p>While this position will represent USAID/ESC to a variety or stakeholders and the functions with &lsquo;alter ego' authority, this will generally occur in an office/business environment and the position is not afforded additional resources for this purpose.</p>

<p align="left">ADDENDUM TO FAR 52.212-2</p>
<p align="left">FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation -- Commercial Items (Oct 2014)</p>
<p align="left">This provision is incorporated by reference, and paragraph (a) is modified to read as follows:</p>
<p align="left">(1) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and technical acceptability considered. The Government intends to make award to the lowest priced technically acceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest. The following listed are evaluation factors that shall be used in the evaluation process:</p>
<p align="left">1. Price<br />2. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p align="left">(i) The price evaluation will be made on the basis of the total price of all line items including all options. An offeror must therefore propose on all line items including options. The Government shall evaluate based on the lowest price technical acceptability. If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical acceptability standard as defined in below paragraph (2), the contract may be awarded to the lowest offeror. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptability as defined in below paragraph (2), it will be eliminated from consideration for award.</p>
<p align="left">(ii) Price Evaluation for Utilization of FAR 52.217-8, Extension of Services Clause: The Government will calculate prices for a quantity equivalent to 6 months by prorating prices offered for CLIN 0001 including Options and evaluate such prices for reasonableness.</p>
<p align="left">(2) Technical Acceptability: Technical Acceptability is achieved when the offeror provides proof of the certification for perform the subject performance. All offerors shall submit Certificate of Scale Measurement Business Registration (&#35336;&#37327;&#22120;&#20462;&#29702;&#20107;&#26989;&#30331;&#37682;&#35388;).</p>
<p align="left">(i) Initially, offers shall be ranked according to evaluated prices. The price evaluation will document for the offers evaluated the completeness, and reasonableness of the proposed price. Incomplete or unreasonable offers shall be rejected and eliminated from further consideration.</p>
<p align="left">(ii) Next, the Government will evaluate the lowest offeror's technical information as referenced in paragraph (2) above. Technical Acceptability for all offerors will be rated as 'acceptable" or "unacceptable" by the government.</p>
<p align="left">(iii) If the lowest offeror meets the Government technical acceptability as defined in above paragraph (2), a Purchase Order will be awarded to the lowest offeror with technically acceptable capability. If the lowest offeror fails to meet the Government technical acceptable capability, the Government will then evaluate the next low offeror in the same manner to determine if they meet the technical capability. This process will continue until an offeror is found to meet the Government technical acceptable capability in ascending order of the low price.</p>
<p align="left">(3) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<SUBJECT>Calculating Postal Price Changes When Quality of Service Varies
<SOLNBR>PRC-2017-1

<CONTACT>Gregory Gray, Financial Manager/Comptroller, Phone 202-789-6840, Fax 202-789-6891, Email gregory.gray@prc.gov - Margaret Cigno, Assistant Director, Office of Accounability and Compliance, Phone 202-789-6855, Fax 202-789-6886, Email margaret.cigno@prc.gov

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background Postal Legislation</span>: The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (PAEA) established an inflation-based cap on the annual rate of price increase in each major category of domestic mail service for which the Postal Service is considered the market-dominant supplier. The PAEA also required establishment of modern service standards (section 3691 of Title 39). In addition, the PAEA required the <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Postal Regulatory </span>Commission<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"> (PRC)</span> to make annual determinations on whether any service standards in effect during the previous fiscal year were not met (section 3653(b)(2) of Title 39). Further, section 3622(a) of Title 39 required the <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">PRC</span> to establish a modern system for regulating rates designed to achieve 9 objectives, taking into account 14 factors. One of those objectives is to maintain high quality service standards established under section 3691.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">Section 3622(d)(3) of Title 39 requires the <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">PRC</span> - ten years after the date of enactment for the PAEA - to "review the system for regulating rates and classes for market dominant products...to determine if the system is achieving the objectives in subsection (b)...The <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">[PRC]</span> may, by regulation, make such modification or adopt such alternative system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products as necessary to achieve the objectives." It is because of this review that <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">the PRC is</span> undertaking this study<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"> and issuing this RFP</span>.</p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Operational Changes Impacting Service Performance Results:</span> In July 2012, the Postal Service closed approximately 150 mail processing plants and eliminated overnight delivery for roughly 20 percent of the mail that had been receiving it. In March 2013, the Postal Service implemented its Load Leveling plan, which allowed Standard Mail normally delivered on Monday to be pushed to Tuesday. This added a day to the delivery time of much of Standard Mail. On January 1, 2015, the Postal Service eliminated overnight delivery for all First-Class single-piece mail, and added an extra day of delivery time for some presorted First Class Mail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Potential Link between a Price Cap System and Service Performance Results</span>: The <span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">PRC</span> is exploring potential methods of identifying and quantifying a link between a price cap system and the Postal Service's service performance results. One method, described in Pearsall and Trozzo (2011), uses a fitted hedonic price equation (HPE<span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">).</span><a style="mso-footnote-id: ftn1" name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"><span><span style="mso-special-character: footnote"><span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">[1]</span></span></span></span></a> Hedonic pricing identifies price factors on the premise that price is determined by internal characteristics of the item as well as external factors. In the case of postal services, an HPE relates tariffs to the properties of the delivery service offered for various pieces of mail. The hedonic properties include shape, weight per piece, speed of delivery, degree of presortation, distance transported, automation preparation, destination entry, size of mailing, et cetera.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in">Changes in the hedonic properties of a piece of mail may be converted to an equivalent change in the piece's postal rate by measuring along the fitted HPE. For example, if speed of delivery has fallen, this could be considered equivalent to a price increase that can be calculated from the HPE. The equivalent price increase would then be added to the nominal price increase to calculate the overall price increase for a hypothetical piece with a fixed speed of delivery. This method could be generalized to account for changes in all of the known hedonic properties of the U.S. mail stream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.25in"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt">Given the subsequent secular decline in mail volumes, the Postal Service has focused a lot of its efforts on improving operational efficiencies as a way to reduce costs and mitigate financial losses. To measure whether its efforts are improving efficiency, the Postal Service uses what is known as a Total Factor Productivity (TFP) index. The TFP index is a measure of long-term productivity trends, and is computed as a ratio of total workload to total resource usage.</span></p>
<p style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 6pt 0.25in; LINE-HEIGHT: normal; TEXT-AUTOSPACE: ; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri">In the face of growing technological and other changes, the PRC believes that it is important to review the Postal Service's TFP model and productivity measurements to ensure that they are reliable and accurate.</span></p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract
awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was
established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a
prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some
external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file
a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG
procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable
Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested
parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under
this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of
an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or
other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following
information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting
Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,
protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer
through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent
Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either
the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.
Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award
or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in
writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in
less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth
in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the
protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed
within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program
should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand
delivery to the Contracting Officer.

Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the
Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not
to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external
forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Statement of Work (SOW)
Readjustment Counseling   SLC VAMC
Contractor shall provide readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans located in rural communities where the veterans reside (greater than 50 miles from the nearest Vet Center) within the following county of Uintah and in the cities of Vernal, UT. These services are performed for the Readjustment Counseling Services at the Provo Vet Center, located at 1807 North, 1120 West, Provo, UT 84604. 
The Contractor shall provide readjustment counseling services to veterans who are assigned to their care. The counseling may include traditional psychotherapeutic modalities, but the purpose of psychotherapy (or any modality) must be, as a primary task, to address readjustment difficulties derived from military duties and the homecoming experience.
1. BACKGROUND
Public law authorizes the Department of Veterans Affair (VA) to provide readjustment counseling to combat veterans and guarantees readjustment counseling as a lifetime entitlement to war zone veterans under Readjustment Counseling Services.

The Vet Center mission is to provide outreach and counseling to assist all combat veterans of any conflict to resolve war-related psychological difficulties and to help them achieve a successful post-war readjustment to civilian life. 

Legislation authorized VA to augment Vet Center services through contracts with private sector providers for provision of readjustment counseling to veterans who served during a period and in the theater of armed hostilities. 

2. POLICY AND AUTHORITY
In accordance with 38 U.S.C. 1712A, Department of Veteran Affairs, Readjustment Counseling Services (RCS) is authorized to furnish readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans  by contract with approved private sector providers, where the VA cannot provide such services.


3. ELIGIBILITY FOR CONTRACTED READJUSTMENT COUNSELING SERVICES

Eligibility will be determined by the Vet Center staff in accordance with Vet Center policy.
 
Eligibility for readjustment counseling services is limited to war zone veterans who were discharged under honorable conditions. Individuals with other than honorable, but more than dishonorable discharge may also be eligible as determined by the VA (see 38 CFR, Section 3.12).

In an emergency, if clinically determined that a crisis exists that requires immediate readjustment counseling services are necessary, the contractor shall immediately contact the Team Leader/COR to provide presumptive eligibility and authorization for services via phone. In such cases, the Team Leader/COR will inform the veteran that if eligibility is not substantiated, the veteran may be billed for the counseling services.

Bereavement services for parents, spouse, children, and immediate family members of active duty Armed Forces personnel, to include Reservist and National Guard members, who have died in the line of duty and service to their country, are  not eligible for services under this contract.

Veterans possessing a Dishonorable Discharge are not eligible for services provided under this program.

Sexual trauma/harassment regarding veterans of both sexes, all eras are not covered by this contract.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBJECT WORK

The Contractor shall furnish readjustment counseling services to eligible veterans referred by the Vet Center staff. No client will be seen without the Vet Center referral and approval.

Readjustment counseling, for purposes of this contract, shall be counseling provided by licensed mental health providers; clinical social workers, psychologist, or other qualified counselors that will provide services specifically directed at social, psychological, or behavioral difficulties explicitly related to the post-war readjustment to civilian life. Such difficulties may interfere with a veteran s job performance, education pursuits, family and other interpersonal relations, or overall ability to cope with daily life.

Modalities of readjustment counseling include individual, group and family counseling; all of which must have as their central purpose the post-war readjustment of war zone veterans. This service does not include general mental health services, but only provides readjustment counseling for psychosocial difficulties related to post-war readjustment from military duty, for example:

Exposure to combat-related war trauma.
Exposure to other aspects of war zone stress.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (as defined by the current DSM) or other war-related social and psychological difficulties.
Stressors unique to military duty for eligible veterans.
Psychological concern over a possible service-connected condition.
Substance abuse connected with military duty and/or post-war homecoming and readjustment.
Difficult post-war experiences, including disrupted homecoming and unsuccessful re-entry into civilian roles.
Concern over possible Agent Orange, biological or chemical agent exposure or ramifications thereof.
Generalized alienation from society manifested by lack of expectable familial, educational or vocational activities.
Psychosocial difficulties related to type of military discharge for other than a dishonorable discharge.

The provision of medications and physical examinations are not to be considered a component of readjustment counseling, and therefore, will not be provided under this contract as a reimbursable service to the contractor.

Nonetheless, offerors should have the capability through referral to arrange for needed physical examinations, prescription medications or other medical treatment. When this is not feasible due to geographical distance, the contract provider should coordinate with the Contracting Officers Representative (COR) or Point of Contact (POC) for assistance in facilitating referrals to VA medical providers.



GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION OF ELIGIBLE SERVICE PROVIDERS
Contractor shall be physically located within the geographic boundaries for which the contract award is made. The boundaries described herein are determined by RCS and local VA officials, based upon  geographical areas of need  (e.g. a given city, county, or locality where a Vet Center is present but, because of a large veteran population, cannot adequately provide services).

4.  PROCEDURE FOR SERVICE INITIATION
Service initiation under this statement of work will be limited to referral only by Vet Center personnel, RCS Regional Managers (RMs) or designees. The number, type and frequency of readjustment counseling services provided to the veteran or significant others (i.e., members of the veteran s immediate family, legal guardian, or an individual with whom the veteran lives or certifies an intention to live with) will be a specifically authorized by referring Vet Center or RCS RMs or designees.

If a veteran visits the contractor s office prior to contacting the Vet Center, the contractor shall provide the veteran the Vet Center contact information, so required interview, record, and official authorization is initiated and approved.

Upon determination of eligibility and completion of psychosocial assessment, determining the need for readjustment counseling services, a referral will be made by completion of contract Services Authorization Form (VA Form 10-5565B). The original shall be maintained within the client s file maintained at the Vet Center. Copy 1 shall be mailed or given to the veteran or significant other, who will maintain and present it to the designated service provider, if the contractor has not received a copy of the authorization. Copy 2 shall be mailed to the designated contract service provider and maintained in the client s records within the contractor s records. Disposition of Contractor s records are property of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 

After eligibility has been verified and the need for readjustment counseling clinically established, the Vet Center TL/COR will complete and sign VA Form 10-5565B, which officially effects a referral to the contract service provider. The completion and disposition of VA Form 10-5565B is to be implemented according to the instructions on the form.

5.  REFERRALS FOR CONTRACT COUNSELING SERVICES
Prior to making a referral to the contract provider, the veteran must be interviewed by the Vet Center Team Leader (TL)/COR/POC or designee.

Veterans Health Administration (VHA) qualified mental health professionals can make referrals to the Vet Center. All referrals made by VHA mental health professionals who are not Vet Center staff, will be facilitated by the Vet Center TL/COR/POC, as the latter will assume responsibility for monitoring the case once the referral to the contract provider is made.

The Contractor is not authorized and prohibited from performing community outreach in conjunction with this contract. 

Contract readjustment counseling includes the same mix of social and psychological services as provided at the Vet Centers, with the exception of community outreach, which the contractor is unauthorized and prohibited to perform. 

The scope of work does not have the provision for general mental health services. 

Contract readjustment counseling shall include social services and/or psychotherapy if needed, but the services provided must address readjustment difficulties deriving from military duties and/or homecoming experiences. The provision of services for problems not having a clear and distinct relationship to military duty and readjustment to civilian life from military duty is not authorized.

Specifically, the difficulties, which comprise war-related readjustment difficulties referable to a contract provider are the following:

Psychosocial problems related to exposure to war trauma.
Psychosocial problems related to other stressful experiences of military duty in a war-zone.
Psychosocial problems related to post-war adjustment to civilian family and work roles.
Psychosocial problems related to type of military discharge.
Psychosocial problems related to substance abuse clinically associated with military duty or post-military readjustment.
Psychosocial problems related to post-war homecoming experiences.
Psychosocial concern over possible exposure to chemical and/or biological agents in the war-zone.
Generalized alienation from society related to interruptions in the normal post-war readjustment process.

Self-referrals and referrals of veterans who were or are in the private contract provider s caseload cannot be authorized, unless the assessment described above is carried out. In no event may VA be billed or required to pay for services delivered prior to authorization for care.

6.  REFERAL MANAGEMENT
Referrals and ongoing assessment of counseling cases will be managed, as to ensure the availability of services to the largest number of eligible veterans within the limits of available resources.

The Contractor shall provide group and/or brief therapy whenever clinically feasible to facilitate serving the largest number of eligible veterans. Theater veterans exposed to war-zone stress will be considered the highest priority recipients for contract readjustment counseling.

Group counseling shall be encouraged whenever clinically feasible as this method is both clinically indicated and cost effective for Veterans with readjustment difficulties. The composition of such groups must include at least 50 percent eligible war-zone Veterans for a contact provider to be reimbursed for the group counseling session. Exceptions to this may be granted by the Vet Center TL/COR/POC when clinically indicated.

Contractor employees shall not be considered Government employees and shall not at any time identify themselves as such or perform community outreach in the name of or as the Vet Center or VA.

In accordance with the terms and conditions of this scope of work, the Professional Services Letter IL -11-82-26, and the VA Form 10-5565B, contractors shall be required to perform as follows:

All initial referrals to a contract provider will be for up to 3 visits for clinical assessment and brief counseling. The TL/COR/POC will specify on VA Form 10-5565B, one, two, or three visits and the type of counseling to be provided (individual).

The contractor shall schedule the initial veteran counseling session (visit) within 10 working days from the date the veteran was first referred under the contract.

If additional visits are required upon completion of the 3 initial visits, the Contractor shall submit, a counseling plan documenting the need for continuing readjustment counseling to the Vet Center TL/COR/POC. The contractor will ensure a DD214 is provided by the veteran and sent to the Vet Center TL/COR/POC for verification. The contractor must maintain a copy in the clients file. 

After reviewing the plan, the TL/COR may authorize the veteran for up to a block of 15 additional visits within a specified period. In similar fashion, subsequent re-authorizations are established (up to 15 visits) and updated case counseling plans are subject to evaluation prior to further authorization.

In an emergency situation and/or veteran crisis, additional visits may be authorized over the phone by the TL/COR/POC. The contract provider updated counseling plan may be presented to the COR/POC orally, but must be documented in the veteran s file and followed with a written copy within forty-eight (48) hours.

Effective management of case progress and available funding requires that the TL/COR/POC specify on the VA Form 10-5565B a time period within which a block of authorized visits must be delivered. For example, a veteran does not use all 13 sessions during the specified time, he may be reviewed and re-authorized for additional visits at the beginning of the next quarter. A visit will last a minimum of 45 minutes for an Individual/Family session and a minimum of 90 minutes for Group sessions.

The initial written counseling plan will be presented to the TL/COR/POC no later than five working days from the completion of the third initial visit.  This plan shall be documented in the veteran s record by the TL/COR/POC and contract provider. 

The VA reserves the right to modify the treatment plan submitted by the Contractor. Coordination of the counseling plans to the VA referrer must occur in a timely manner, so there will be no disruption in the continuation of readjustment counseling. An updated treatment plan must be submitted and approved by the TL/COR/POC before subsequent client visits are authorized for the upcoming quarter.

While up to one visit per week is usually authorized, the TL/COR/POC is under no obligation to authorize that frequency.

Frequency of visits of less than one time per week (e.g., once per two weeks, once per month) is clinically indicated in a substantial number of cases.  It is the responsibility of the TL/COR/POC to ensure that such frequency is obtained when indicated.
Visits of twice per week may be permitted in exceptional cases when authorized by the COR/POC on the basis of clinical assessment.

Resource allocation per facility, overall needs of the total eligible veteran population in a particular locality, sound clinical practice, and the needs of an individual veteran will usually dictate a frequency of visits of one per week or less.

 Significant Others  defined as, members of the Veteran s immediate family, legal guardian, or individual with whom the Veteran lives of certifies an intention to live. May be seen conjointly with a Veteran in couple or family counseling by the contract service provider.

This will be limited to counseling for problems, which have a distinct relationship to the Veteran s readjustment from military duty.

For couple or family counseling, billing and reimbursement will be at the established per session rate as specified in the contract.

Significant others may be seen without the Veteran present only when clinically required as an integral part of couple or family counseling. Such visits by significant others without the Veteran present, however, are limited to one visit per ten couple or family sessions that include the Veteran. Exceptions may be granted to the limitation on significant other visits only when clinically approved by the TL/COR/POC.

As stipulated in the scope of work, there is a provision, which limits eligibility for readjustment counseling through a contract provider to 1 year from the time of the veteran s first visit.

This provision is based upon existing knowledge regarding the etiology and longitudinal course of war-related readjustment difficulties to include post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and upon program experience, which indicates that most veterans referred complete services within 1 year.

This provision should not be implemented in an arbitrary manner nor should it be applied in isolation from other indicators for clinical case progress.

In most cases authorization beyond 1 year should be short-term extensions designed to facilitate completing services or appropriate referral.

Determination for extension of eligibility for contract services beyond 1 year, will be determined by a clinical report and plan submitted by the contractor, that will be reviewed by the TL/COR, and approved by the Regional Manager or designee.
 
To determine and approve a veteran for an extension, the following procedures will be followed:

The contract provider will submit a request with a report and plan, with clinical significance of need for additional services beyond one year. This is not an authorization for service, but report of further readjustment counseling need.
 
The Vet Center TL/COR/POC will review this report, determine if extension is clinically significant, and will interview the veteran (in person or by telephone) to conduct an updated, comprehensive psychosocial assessment to ensure continuing clinical need for readjustment counseling.

If there is clinical indication for continuing readjustment counseling beyond 1 year, the Vet Center TL/COR must consult with the RCS Regional Manager or designee prior to authorizing continuing visits. 

All requests for readjustment counseling beyond 1 year, for more than brief transitioning purposes, must be reviewed and approved by the RCS Regional Manager or designee and documented in the veteran s clinical record.

If a veteran currently receiving services from a contract provider resides in a closer proximity to a newly selected contract provider or newly established Vet Center, the veteran may be transferred to the new contract provider or newly established Vet Center, in order to continue uninterrupted counseling from the most convenient service provider.

<DESC><p>Question:&nbsp; In Part 1, Section B, Supplies or services. All line items list FOB as Source. However in Section F, Deliveries. The government has incorporated FAR 52.247-34 for FOB Destination. Could the USAF clarify the freight status?</p>
<p>Answer: 52.247-34 will be removed. FOB is at source per Section B, Supplies or Services.</p>
<p>Question: Part 1, Line item 001 The government requirement is for three different installations, which comprise of different components, all of which effect the unit pricing. Can the government separate the line item to allow separate pricing of each configuration?</p>
<p>Answer: Government will maintain CLIN 0001 configuration as written.</p>
<p>Question: Part 1 Optional Line Item 1002, The government requirement is for two different installations, which comprise of different components, all of which effect the unit pricing. Can the government separate the line item to allow separate pricing of each configuration?</p>
<p>Answer: Government will maintain CLIN 1002 configuration as written.</p>
<p>Question: A fit event was discussed at Industry Day, which would allow vendors to access all configurations and corresponding TOs. Will the AF allow vendors to access these configurations at least three weeks prior to RFP response?</p>
<p>Answer: While the Government previously considered offering this opportunity, it is not the intent of the Government to allow access to any configurations or TOs prior to RFP release. All vendors had the opportunity to inspect configurations and verify fitting on 18-26 Sep 2014 at Randolph AFB date. The configurations and specifications have not changed since the fit verification on 18-26 Sep 2014. In order to ensure that the beacons fit within the given configurations, the Government will be conducting Fit Verifications as outlined in Section L.</p>

Accordingly, all such positions require a favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program; and a favorable background investigation determination conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).

A favorable screening (applicant and suitability) determination must be made by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of the Indian Education Programs (OIEP), Personnel Security and Suitability Program prior to contract award or made within 60 days of incorporation of this clause into a current/existing contract.

The individual and or the company who proposed to employ this individual may be determined to be non-responsible if an unfavorable screening (applicant and suitability) determinations is made, which will make them ineligible for purchase order award. If an unfavorable final background investigation determination is made, the purchase order may be terminated and the employee in question shall not be authorized to provide service to the BIA, OIEP, if the services involve contact with or regular control over Indian children.

The award will be made to the lowest priced offeror, whose quotation is conforming to the requirement herein and will be most advantageous to the Government, and is fair and reasonable.

The full text of the referenced FAR clauses may be accessed electronically at https://www.acquisition.gov/far/. <BR> <BR>This contract incorporates one or more clauses by reference, with the same force and effect as if they were given in full text. Upon request, the Contracting Officer will make their full text available. Also, the full text of a clause may be accessed electronically at this/these address(es):  http://www.acquisition.gov/far, http://www.doi.gov/pam, http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/2010/2010-7967.htm <BR> <BR>(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals- (A) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [  ] have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks "have", the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); (C) Are [  ] are not [  ] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and Cont... <BR> <BR>(D) Have [  ], have not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [  ] has not [  ], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) "Principal," for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. (c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror's responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror nonresponsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>(a) Inspection/Acceptance. The Contractor shall only tender for acceptance those items that conform to the requirements of this contract. The Government reserves the right to inspect or test any supplies or services that have been tendered for acceptance. The Government may require repair or replacement of nonconforming supplies or reperformance of nonconforming services at no increase in contract price. If repair/replacement or reperformance will not correct the defects or is not possible, the Government may seek an equitable price reduction or adequate consideration for acceptance of nonconforming supplies or services. The Government must exercise its post-acceptance rights? (1) Within a reasonable time after the defect was discovered or should have been discovered; and (2) Before any substantial change occurs in the condition of the item, unless the change is due to the defect in the item. (b) Assignment. The Contractor or its assignee may assign its rights to receive payment due as a result of performance of this contract to a bank, trust company, or other financing institution, including any Federal lending agency in accordance with the Assignment of Claims Act (31 U.S.C. 3727). However, when a third party makes payment (e.g., use of the Governmentwide commercial purchase card), the Contractor may not assign its rights to receive payment under this contract. (c) Changes. Changes in the terms and conditions of this contract may be made only by written agreement of the parties. (d) Disputes. This contract is subject to 41 U.S.C. chapter 71, Contract Disputes. Failure of the parties to this contract to reach agreement on any request for equitable adjustment, claim, appeal or action arising under or relating to this contract shall be a dispute to be resolved in accordance with the clause at FAR 52.233-1, Disputes, which is incorporated herein by reference. The Contractor shall proceed diligently with performance of this contract, pending final resolution of any dispute arising under the contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(e) Definitions. The clause at FAR 52.202-1, Definitions, is incorporated herein by reference. (f) Excusable delays. The Contractor shall be liable for default unless nonperformance is caused by an occurrence beyond the reasonable control of the Contractor and without its fault or negligence such as, acts of God or the public enemy, acts of the Government in either its sovereign or contractual capacity, fires, floods, epidemics, quarantine restrictions, strikes, unusually severe weather, and delays of common carriers. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer in writing as soon as it is reasonably possible after the commencement of any excusable delay, setting forth the full particulars in connection therewith, shall remedy such occurrence with all reasonable dispatch, and shall promptly give written notice to the Contracting Officer of the cessation of such occurrence. (g) Invoice. (1) The Contractor shall submit an original invoice and three copies (or electronic invoice, if authorized) to the address designated in the contract to receive invoices. An invoice must include? (i) Name and address of the Contractor; (ii) Invoice date and number; (iii) Contract number, contract line item number and, if applicable, the order number; (iv) Description, quantity, unit of measure, unit price and extended price of the items delivered; (v) Shipping number and date of shipment, including the bill of lading number and weight of shipment if shipped on Government bill of lading; (vi) Terms of any discount for prompt payment offered; (vii) Name and address of official to whom payment is to be sent; (viii) Name, title, and phone number of person to notify in event of defective invoice; and (ix) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). The Contractor shall include its TIN on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract. (x) Electronic funds transfer (EFT) banking information. (A) The Contractor shall include EFT banking information on the invoice only if required elsewhere in this contract.

(C) EFT banking information is not required if the Government waived the requirement to pay by EFT. (2) Invoices will be handled in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315.

The Contractor shall indemnify the Government and its officers, employees and agents against liability, including costs, for actual or alleged direct or contributory infringement of, or inducement to infringe, any United States or foreign patent, trademark or copyright, arising out of the performance of this contract, provided the Contractor is reasonably notified of such claims and proceedings.

The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR Part 1315. (3) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (4) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date which appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (5) Overpayments. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate contract financing or invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a contract financing or invoice payment, the Contractor shall? (i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the?

Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid a percentage of the contract price reflecting the percentage of the work performed prior to the notice of termination, plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system, have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose.

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <BR> <BR>(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. Cont... <BR> <BR>(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. (u) Unauthorized Obligations (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (v) Incorporation by reference. The Contractor?s representations and certifications, including those completed electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM), are incorporated by reference into the contract. (End of Clause) <BR> <BR>When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause. (a) Inspection/Acceptance. (1) The Government has the right to inspect and test all materials furnished and services performed under this contract, to the extent practicable at all places and times, including the period of performance, and in any event before acceptance. The Government may also inspect the plant or plants of the Contractor or any subcontractor engaged in contract performance. The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work. (2) If the Government performs inspection or tests on the premises of the Contractor or a subcontractor, the Contractor shall furnish and shall require subcontractors to furnish all reasonable facilities and assistance for the safe and convenient performance of these duties. (3) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Government will accept or reject services and materials at the place of delivery as promptly as practicable after delivery, and they will be presumed accepted 60 days after the date of delivery, unless accepted earlier. (4) At any time during contract performance, but not later than 6 months (or such other time as may be specified in the contract) after acceptance of the services or materials last delivered under this contract, the Government may require the Contractor to replace or correct services or materials that at time of delivery failed to meet contract requirements. Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5)(i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may? <BR> <BR>(A) By contract or otherwise, perform the replacement or correction, charge to the Contractor any increased cost, or deduct such increased cost from any amounts paid or due under this contract; or (B) Terminate this contract for cause. (ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to? (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor's managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. (8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract. (9) Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the Contractor's obligation to correct or replace Government-furnished property shall be governed by the clause pertaining to Government property.

(D) When requested by the Contracting Officer or the authorized representative, the Contractor shall substantiate invoices (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule) by evidence of actual payment, individual daily job timecards, records that verify the employees meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract, or other substantiation specified in the contract. (E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis. (1) If no overtime rates are provided in the Schedule and the Contracting Officer approves overtime work in advance, overtime rates shall be negotiated. (2) Failure to agree upon these overtime rates shall be treated as a dispute under the Disputes clause of this contract. (3) If the Schedule provides rates for overtime, the premium portion of those rates will be reimbursable only to the extent the overtime is approved by the Contracting Officer. Cont... <BR> <BR>(ii) Materials. (A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor?s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the? (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor? (1) Has made payments for materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice; or (2) Makes these payments within 30 days of the submission of the Contractor?s payment request to the Government and such payment is in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement or invoice. (C) To the extent able, the Contractor shall? (1) Obtain materials at the most advantageous prices available with due regard to securing prompt delivery of satisfactory materials; and (2) Give credit to the Government for cash and trade discounts, rebates, scrap, commissions, and other amounts that are identifiable to the contract. (D) Other Costs. Unless listed below, other direct and indirect costs will not be reimbursed. (1) Other Direct Costs. The Government will reimburse the Contractor on the basis of actual cost for the following, provided such costs comply with the requirements in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(B) of this clause: [Insert each element of other direct costs (e.g., travel, computer usage charges, etc. Insert ?None? if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided. If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the elements of other direct charge(s) for that order or, if no reimbursement for other direct costs will be provided, insert ?None?.?] (2) Indirect Costs (Material Handling, Subcontract Administration, etc.). The Government will reimburse the Contractor for indirect costs on a pro-rata basis over the period of contract performance at the following fixed price: [Insert a fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule. Insert ?$0? if no fixed price reimbursement for indirect costs will be provided. (If this is an indefinite delivery contract, the Contracting Officer may insert ?Each order must list separately the fixed amount for the indirect costs and payment schedule or, if no reimbursement for indirect costs, insert ?None?).?] Cont... <BR> <BR>(2) Total cost. It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract. (3) Ceiling price. The Government will not be obligated to pay the Contractor any amount in excess of the ceiling price in the Schedule, and the Contractor shall not be obligated to continue performance if to do so would exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule, unless and until the Contracting Officer notifies the Contractor in writing that the ceiling price has been increased and specifies in the notice a revised ceiling that shall constitute the ceiling price for performance under this contract. When and to the extent that the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule has been increased, any hours expended and material costs incurred by the Contractor in excess of the ceiling price before the increase shall be allowable to the same extent as if the hours expended and material costs had been incurred after the increase in the ceiling price. Cont... <BR> <BR>(4) Access to records. At any time before final payment under this contract, the Contracting Officer (or authorized representative) will have access to the following (access shall be limited to the listing below unless otherwise agreed to by the Contractor and the Contracting Officer): (i) Records that verify that the employees whose time has been included in any invoice meet the qualifications for the labor categories specified in the contract; (ii) For labor hours (including any subcontractor hours reimbursed at the hourly rate in the schedule), when timecards are required as substantiation for payment? (A) The original timecards (paper-based or electronic); (B) The Contractor?s timekeeping procedures; (C) Contractor records that show the distribution of labor between jobs or contracts; and (D) Employees whose time has been included in any invoice for the purpose of verifying that these employees have worked the hours shown on the invoices. (iii) For material and subcontract costs that are reimbursed on the basis of actual cost? (A) Any invoices or subcontract agreements substantiating material costs; and (B) Any documents supporting payment of those invoices. (5) Overpayments/Underpayments. Each payment previously made shall be subject to reduction to the extent of amounts, on preceding invoices, that are found by the Contracting Officer not to have been properly payable and shall also be subject to reduction for overpayments or to increase for underpayments. The Contractor shall promptly pay any such reduction within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The Government within 30 days will pay any such increases, unless the parties agree otherwise. The Contractor?s payment will be made by check. If the Contractor becomes aware of a duplicate invoice payment or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on an invoice payment, the Contractor shall? Cont... <BR> <BR>(i) Remit the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the contract along with a description of the overpayment including the? (A) Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment, erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment); (B) Affected contract number and delivery order number, if applicable; (C) Affected contract line item or subline item, if applicable; and (D) Contractor point of contact. (ii) Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to the Contracting Officer. (6)(i) All amounts that become payable by the Contractor to the Government under this contract shall bear simple interest from the date due until paid unless paid within 30 days of becoming due. The interest rate shall be the interest rate established by the Secretary of the Treasury, as provided in 41 U.S.C. 7109, which is applicable to the period in which the amount becomes due, and then at the rate applicable for each six month period as established by the Secretary until the amount is paid. (ii) The Government may issue a demand for payment to the Contractor upon finding a debt is due under the contract. (iii) Final Decisions. The Contracting Officer will issue a final decision as required by 33.211 if? (A) The Contracting Officer and the Contractor are unable to reach agreement on the existence or amount of a debt in a timely manner; (B) The Contractor fails to liquidate a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer within the timeline specified in the demand for payment unless the amounts were not repaid because the Contractor has requested an installment payment agreement; or (C) The Contractor requests a deferment of collection on a debt previously demanded by the Contracting Officer (see FAR 32.607-2). Cont... <BR> <BR>(iv) If a demand for payment was previously issued for the debt, the demand for payment included in the final decision shall identify the same due date as the original demand for payment. (v) Amounts shall be due at the earliest of the following dates: (A) The date fixed under this contract. (B) The date of the first written demand for payment, including any demand for payment resulting from a default termination. (vi) The interest charge shall be computed for the actual number of calendar days involved beginning on the due date and ending on? (A) The date on which the designated office receives payment from the Contractor; (B) The date of issuance of a Government check to the Contractor from which an amount otherwise payable has been withheld as a credit against the contract debt; or (C) The date on which an amount withheld and applied to the contract debt would otherwise have become payable to the Contractor. (vii) The interest charge made under this clause may be reduced under the procedures prescribed in 32.608-2 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation in effect on the date of this contract. (viii) Upon receipt and approval of the invoice designated by the Contractor as the ?completion invoice? and supporting documentation, and upon compliance by the Contractor with all terms of this contract, any outstanding balances will be paid within 30 days unless the parties agree otherwise. The completion invoice, and supporting documentation, shall be submitted by the Contractor as promptly as practicable following completion of the work under this contract, but in no event later than 1 year (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may approve in writing) from the date of completion. Cont... <BR> <BR>(7) Release of claims. The Contractor, and each assignee under an assignment entered into under this contract and in effect at the time of final payment under this contract, shall execute and deliver, at the time of and as a condition precedent to final payment under this contract, a release discharging the Government, its officers, agents, and employees of and from all liabilities, obligations, and claims arising out of or under this contract, subject only to the following exceptions. (i) Specified claims in stated amounts, or in estimated amounts if the amounts are not susceptible to exact statement by the Contractor. (ii) Claims, together with reasonable incidental expenses, based upon the liabilities of the Contractor to third parties arising out of performing this contract, that are not known to the Contractor on the date of the execution of the release, and of which the Contractor gives notice in writing to the Contracting Officer not more than 6 years after the date of the release or the date of any notice to the Contractor that the Government is prepared to make final payment, whichever is earlier. (iii) Claims for reimbursement of costs (other than expenses of the Contractor by reason of its indemnification of the Government against patent liability), including reasonable incidental expenses, incurred by the Contractor under the terms of this contract relating to patents. Cont... <BR> <BR>(8) Prompt payment. The Government will make payment in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act (31 U.S.C. 3903) and prompt payment regulations at 5 CFR part 1315. (9) Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). If the Government makes payment by EFT, see 52.212-5(b) for the appropriate EFT clause. (10) Discount. In connection with any discount offered for early payment, time shall be computed from the date of the invoice. For the purpose of computing the discount earned, payment shall be considered to have been made on the date that appears on the payment check or the specified payment date if an electronic funds transfer payment is made. (l) Termination for the Government?s convenience. The Government reserves the right to terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for its sole convenience. In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records. The Contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. (m) Termination for cause. The Government may terminate this contract, or any part hereof, for cause in the event of any default by the Contractor, or if the Contractor fails to comply with any contract terms and conditions, or fails to provide the Government, upon request, with adequate assurances of future performance. In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

Brothers Elizabeth City, NC 27909 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester&rsquo;s concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency&rsquo;s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Amendment Number 3 
P00002

SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS (SFO) VA-101-15-R-0161
Cape Girardeau, MO

November 14, 2016

Solicitation for Offers (SFO) No. VA-101-15-R-0161 was issued March 31, 2016 for lease of 43,000 net usable square feet (NUSF) of Outpatient Clinic (OPC) space for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in Cape Girardeau, MO.

The following changes/clarifications are hereby made to the above-referenced SFO.  All offerors must acknowledge receipt of this email delivery.

1.  Part 01   SFO Paragraph 1.4 TERM is deleted and replaced with the following;

1.4 TERM

All offerors must submit proposals based on the following:
 
  Alternate A) 15-year firm term;
  Alternate B) 15-year firm term, with five 1-year options; and
  Alternate C) 20-year firm term.
 
The Contracting Officer reserves the right to award on any available alternate listed above, based on what is in the best interest to the Government.  For instance, the Contracting Officer could elect to award a 20-year firm term, a 15-year firm term, or a 15-year firm term with five 1-year options.
 
All the terms and conditions contained herein shall prevail throughout the term of the lease, including all renewal options.  Offerors are advised that they must submit pricing for all Alternates listed above to be considered responsive.  Offerors submitting different or fewer pricing alternates shall be rejected as non-responsive by the Contracting Officer.

2.  Part 01   SFO Paragraph 2.2.1 PRICE EVALUATION is deleted and replaced with the following;

2.2.1 PRICE EVALUATION

A.  Present Value Price Evaluation
1.  The Offeror must submit plans and any other information to demonstrate that the rentable space yields Net Usable space within the required Net Usable range. The Government will convert the rentable prices offered in GSA Form 1364 and/or Attachment 1 to GSA Form 1364A to Net Usable prices, which will subsequently be used in the price evaluation.
2.  Evaluation of offered prices will be on the basis of the annual shell rental rate per Net Usable square foot, including any option periods and for all items reimbursed to the Lessor in a Lump Sum payment, as annotated in Attachment 1 to GSA Form 1364A (the costs for these items are present value; therefore, it will not be discounted.) The Government will use that data to perform a net present value price evaluation by reducing the prices per annual shell Net Usable square foot to a composite annual Net Usable square foot price as follows:
(a)  Parking and wayward areas will be excluded from the total square footage but not from the price. For different types of space, the gross annual per square foot price will be determined by dividing the total annual rental by the total square footage minus these areas.

(b)  Free or reduced rent will be evaluated in the year in which it is offered. The gross, averaged annual per square foot price is adjusted to reflect free rent.

(c)  Also as stated in the "Broker Commission" paragraph, the amount of any commission paid to VA s Broker will not be considered separately as part of this price evaluation since the value of the commission is subsumed in the gross rent rate.

(d)  To evaluate the real value of rent today, over the given term of the lease, the analysis will compound the amount of rent at a given (discount) rate. The gross annual per Net Usable square foot shell rental costs will be discounted annually at 3.05 percent (15-year firm term) or 3.2 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term) (OMB Circular No. A-94) over the entire term of the lease, to yield a net present value cost (NPV) per net usable square foot. This will provide an annual present value of the proposed rent, for years two through the term of the lease, at this 3.05 percent discount (15-year firm term) or 3.2 percent discount (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term).

(e) If annual adjustments in operating expenses will not be made, the operating expenses will be both escalated at 1.95 percent (15-year firm term) or 2.0 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term) compounded annually and discounted annually at 3.05 percent (15-year firm term) or 3.2 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term), then added to the net Present Value Cost (PVC) to yield the gross PVC.

(f) If annual adjustments in operating expenses will be made, the annual per square foot price, and the base cost of operating expenses, will be discounted annually at 3.05 percent (15-year firm term) or 3.2 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term) to yield a net PVC per square foot. 

(g) To the gross PVC will be added:

 1. The cost of Government-provided services not included in the rental escalated at 1.95 percent (15-year firm term) or 2.0 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term) compounded annually and discounted annually at 3.05 percent (15-year firm term) or 3.2 percent (15-year firm term with five 1-year options; 20-year firm term).

 2. The annualized (over the full term) per ANSI/BOMA Office Area square foot cost of any items, which are to be reimbursed in a lump sum payment. (The cost of these items is present value; therefore, it will not be discounted.)

 3. The cost of relocation of furniture, telecommunications, replications costs, and other move-related costs, if applicable.
 

3.  Part 01   SFO Paragraph 2.2.2 TECHNICAL QUALITY, subparagraph B, Technical Evaluation Factor 2: Capabilities, subparagraph (3) Offeror s Experience is deleted and replaced with the following;

(3) Offeror s Experience
Offeror shall submit experience, occurring within the past three (3) years, developing, managing, and operating medical facility projects.  Experience with medical facility projects that are comparable in size and complexity or exceed the size and complexity of this project will be considered more relevant than those that are smaller in size and less complex than this project. In the context of the above, VA projects are more relevant than non-VA federal government projects, which are more relevant than non-federal government projects. Experience with non-medical facility projects will be considered the least relevant.

4.  Part 01   SFO Paragraph 2.10 DISCUSSIONS is deleted and replaced with the following;

2.10 DISCUSSIONS

VA will hold discussions only with those Offerors who have been placed in the competitive range as established under procedures in FAR Paragraph 15.306  Exchanges with offerors after receipt of proposals .  The VA Contracting Officer will conduct discussions on behalf of the Government in order to obtain the best value to the Government.  Other VA personnel, including the Contracting Officer s Representative named on the cover of this Solicitation, may assist the Contracting Officer, however the Contracting Officer is the only authorized person to hold discussions (negotiate). 

If an award is not made based on the initial proposals, the following process will occur: 

Each Offeror in the competitive range will be given an opportunity to submit a "final proposal revision" to clarify and document understandings reached during negotiations.  Once final proposal revisions are received, all discussions will cease.  After the conclusion of negotiations and a review of final proposal revisions are completed, the Contracting Officer may award the lease. 

5.  Part 01   SFO Paragraph 2.2.2 TECHNICAL QUALITY, subparagraph B, Technical Evaluation Factor 2: Capabilities, subparagraph (3) Offeror s Experience is deleted and replaced with the following;

(3) Offeror s Experience
Offeror shall submit experience, occurring within the past three (3) years, developing, managing, and operating medical facility projects.  Experience with medical facility projects that are comparable in size and complexity or exceed the size and complexity of this project will be considered more relevant than those that are smaller in size and less complex than this project. In the context of the above, VA projects are more relevant than non-VA federal government projects, which are more relevant than non-federal government projects. Experience with non-medical facility projects will be considered the least relevant.
 
6.  Part 01   SFO Paragraph 5.2.5 GRADING DESIGN, subparagraph  c  is deleted and replaced with the following;

c.  Accessible routes used by people with disabilities shall conform to the criteria of Paragraph 4.6 ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS of this SFO.

7.  Part 01   SFO Paragraph 8.1 UTILITIES is deleted and replaced with the following;

8.1 UTILITIES

The Lessor shall ensure that public utilities, (to include TV cable, internet, physical security, fire, C02 and monitoring of the same) necessary for operation are available and operable at the site at the time of final inspection. The Lessor is required to pay any deposits and hook-up fees relative to utilities (water-tap fee, water connection fee, sewer connection fee, sewer tap fee, etc.). 

The cost of utilities will be a Government responsibility.  Utility services include (electricity, telephone, internet service, cable media, gas, water, and sewage) for space occupied and utilized by VA.

8.  Part 01 -- SFO Paragraph 8.2.3 INTERIOR CLEANING BY LESSOR is deleted and reserved.  Interior cleaning will become a Government responsibility.  (SFO Paragraph 8.2.2 EXTERIOR CLEANING BY LESSOR remains valid as written in the SFO).

9.  Offeror Request for Information (RFI)

As a result of  Discussions with Offerors  conducted in accordance with FAR 15.306  Exchanges with 
offerors after receipt of proposals , offerors will receive a letter summary list of weaknesses and deficiencies in their offer.  The summary will not be all-inclusive.  In accordance with FAR 15.306 (d)(3)  the contracting officer is not required to discuss every area where the proposal could be improved, the scope and extent of 
discussions are a matter of contracting officer judgment .

10.  Part 07   LABOR STANDARDS, General Decision Number: MO160006 03/04/2016MO6 is deleted and replaced with the following;

================================================================
 
Unlisted classifications needed for work not included within
the scope of the classifications listed may be added after
award only as provided in the labor standards contract clauses
(29CFR 5.5 (a) (1) (ii)).

----------------------------------------------------------------
 
The body of each wage determination lists the classification
and wage rates that have been found to be prevailing for the
cited type(s) of construction in the area covered by the wage
determination. The classifications are listed in alphabetical
order of "identifiers" that indicate whether the particular
rate is a union rate (current union negotiated rate for local),
a survey rate (weighted average rate) or a union average rate
(weighted union average rate).

Union Rate Identifiers

A four-letter classification abbreviation identifier enclosed
in dotted lines beginning with characters other than "SU" or
"UAVG" denotes that the union classification and rate were
prevailing for that classification in the survey. Example:
PLUM0198-005 07/01/2014. PLUM is an abbreviation identifier of
the union which prevailed in the survey for this
classification, which in this example would be Plumbers. 0198
indicates the local union number or district council number
where applicable, i.e., Plumbers Local 0198. The next number,
005 in the example, is an internal number used in processing
the wage determination. 07/01/2014 is the effective date of the
most current negotiated rate, which in this example is July 1,
2014.

Union prevailing wage rates are updated to reflect all rate
changes in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) governing
this classification and rate.

Survey Rate Identifiers

Classifications listed under the "SU" identifier indicate that
no one rate prevailed for this classification in the survey and
the published rate is derived by computing a weighted average
rate based on all the rates reported in the survey for that
classification.  As this weighted average rate includes all
rates reported in the survey, it may include both union and
non-union rates. Example: SULA2012-007 5/13/2014. SU indicates
the rates are survey rates based on a weighted average
calculation of rates and are not majority rates. LA indicates
the State of Louisiana. 2012 is the year of survey on which
these classifications and rates are based. The next number, 007
in the example, is an internal number used in producing the
wage determination. 5/13/2014 indicates the survey completion
date for the classifications and rates under that identifier.

Survey wage rates are not updated and remain in effect until a
new survey is conducted.

Union Average Rate Identifiers

Classification(s) listed under the UAVG identifier indicate
that no single majority rate prevailed for those
classifications; however, 100% of the data reported for the
classifications was union data. EXAMPLE: UAVG-OH-0010
08/29/2014. UAVG indicates that the rate is a weighted union
average rate. OH indicates the state. The next number, 0010 in
the example, is an internal number used in producing the wage
determination. 08/29/2014 indicates the survey completion date
for the classifications and rates under that identifier.

A UAVG rate will be updated once a year, usually in January of
each year, to reflect a weighted average of the current
negotiated/CBA rate of the union locals from which the rate is
based.
----------------------------------------------------------------
                   WAGE DETERMINATION APPEALS PROCESS

1.) Has there been an initial decision in the matter? This can
be:

*  an existing published wage determination
*  a survey underlying a wage determination
*  a Wage and Hour Division letter setting forth a position on
   a wage determination matter
*  a conformance (additional classification and rate) ruling

On survey related matters, initial contact, including requests
for summaries of surveys, should be with the Wage and Hour
Regional Office for the area in which the survey was conducted
because those Regional Offices have responsibility for the
Davis-Bacon survey program. If the response from this initial
contact is not satisfactory, then the process described in 2.)
and 3.) should be followed.

With regard to any other matter not yet ripe for the formal
process described here, initial contact should be with the
Branch of Construction Wage Determinations.  Write to:

            Branch of Construction Wage Determinations
            Wage and Hour Division
            U.S. Department of Labor
            200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
            Washington, DC 20210

2.) If the answer to the question in 1.) is yes, then an
interested party (those affected by the action) can request
review and reconsideration from the Wage and Hour Administrator
(See 29 CFR Part 1.8 and 29 CFR Part 7). Write to:

            Wage and Hour Administrator
            U.S. Department of Labor
            200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
            Washington, DC 20210

The request should be accompanied by a full statement of the
interested party's position and by any information (wage
payment data, project description, area practice material,
etc.) that the requestor considers relevant to the issue.

3.) If the decision of the Administrator is not favorable, an
interested party may appeal directly to the Administrative
Review Board (formerly the Wage Appeals Board).  Write to:

            Administrative Review Board
            U.S. Department of Labor
            200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.
            Washington, DC 20210

4.) All decisions by the Administrative Review Board are final.






































Only those offerors identified in the competitive range may respond to this amendment. Revised proposals are due by 4:00PM Eastern on December 7, 2016.

<p><br />The current PROS contract requires vendor quotes to be valid for 60 days. There are instances when vendor quotes are higher than anticipated, forcing the FMS customer to obtain additional funding and potentially resulting in a request for the vendor to extend the timeframe of their quote. Anecdotal data suggests that it may require FMS customers more than 60 days to amend their case in order to add funding. To account for this possibility, the USG is considering revising the vendor quote validity requirement from 60 to 90 days. Please identify what impacts, if any, this revision would have upon your proposal.</p>
<p><br />Responses to this question should be submitted in writing to Ms. Tamara Tobe, Contract Specialist, at tamara.tobe@us.af.mil by 12:00pm Eastern on Friday, February 27. Non-responses will not negatively impact an offeror's eligibility.</p>

<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">****************************************************************<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp; Sources Sought Synopsis:<br />THIS DOCUMENT IS FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL/QUOTE. </span>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Directorate located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base OH anticipates a competitive acquisition to provide acquisition services for non-standard and difficult to purchase standard items in support of foreign military sales. This tri-service contract will support FMS Air Force, Navy and Army requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contract Effort Description: The Parts Repair Ordering System (PROS) Program contractor is responsible for the purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. The contract is managed by a dedicated program office at AFSAC that oversees the contractor's performance and monitors the flow of FMS requirements to the contractor. The objectives of PROS are to provide timely support, competitive pricing, quality service and quality program management to the FMS customer. The PROS program goal is to provide "one stop shopping" for the FMS country. The current contract structure consists of indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ), period of performance June 2012 - June 2017 (3-year base period with 2 one-year options), firm fixed price (fill fees), firm fixed price and cost reimbursable (task orders), cost reimbursable (pass through subcontractor costs) and an Objective Performance Incentive (OPI) . NOTE: The contemplated period of performance for this acquisition is 5-7 years, with a 3-6 month ramp up period to create and implement a procurement software system capable of interfacing with AFSAC's Security Assistance Management Information System (SAMIS), along with a logistics transition phase between the current and subsequent contractor. Government requests industry feedback on contemplated Period of Performance (PoP) and suggested ramp up period required in order for USG to solicit realistic time frames.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Historical Environment: Approximately 75% of current supply actions are one-time only actions. The 90+ plus users of the contract provide no computation of failure rates. The lack of repeat actions and no provision of failure rate computations make predicting future requirements impossible. Approximately 75% of current supply actions are non-standard, that is-- not stored, stocked, issued or managed by the US Air Force and usually there is not a National Stock Number (NSN). The standard items with a NSN (remaining 25%) supported on this contract are waived by the USAF for supply action usually due to inability to meet an established need date. However, the managing US DoD source of supply restricts acquisitions to only US DoD approved sources. Approximately 22,000 supply requisitions and 4,500 maintenance requisitions are issued per year. Approximately 80% of the contract actions are supply with the remainder being maintenance and task orders.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This contractual effort is for a commercial buying service. The majority of the contract value is pass-through costs to the vendor/manufacturer/repair service/task order sub-contractor of the item/service. The successful bidder for this contract will earn a small portion of the total estimated value of the contract. The probable (contract structure is not currently finalized) sources of revenue for the successful bidder will be specific fixed fee charges for specific buying type services identified in the contract schedule and OPI. The successful bidder shall have total liability for Supply Discrepancy Reports (SDRs). This will include residual SDRs filed up to the allowable one year after shipment of an item even though the contract-ordering period may have been completed several years before. The successful bidder shall be advised to make arrangements to address this potential liability. <br />NOTE: The SDR process has been problematic in previous contracts. It is our desire to clearly establish roles and responsibilities with respect to SDRs. We request industry comments on structuring SDR liability and resolution. Generally orders are for small quantities, no large production runs. A significant amount of total contract value amount is pass-through costs for procuring required parts and services.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Desirable Features: Competitive environment for the contractor to drive performance; current contract contains a 90% effective competition rate. Leverage commercial marketplace for fostering synergistic partnerships with OEMs, online inventory for customer/contractor reference. Desire cost savings - best available price - minimizing participation fees, turn-around time - shortest possible lead-time - lead-time from after receipt of order to shipment. Goal- Design mission support strategies that obtain higher levels of contractor performance, foster synergistic partnerships, accommodate changing or unforeseen mission needs, and leverage commercial best practices.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information is being collected from all potential sources at this time. Small business and other than small business participation is encouraged. Each company responding should indicate their business size in relation to the stated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code size standard. The NAICS assigned to this acquisition is 541614, "Process, Physical Distribution, and Logistics Consulting", with a size standard of $15M. Your response must also indicate all socio-economic small business categories for which you qualify; small business, small disadvantaged business, 8(a), woman-owned, economically disadvantaged women-owned, veteran-owned, service-disabled veteran-owned, and HUBZone. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (www.sam.gov) database to be awarded a DOD contract. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14. If you are a Small Business and you intend to subcontract a portion of this effort, please explain in your response how you intend to meet the 50% performance requirement. Additionally, firms having GSA schedules should indicate their GSA schedule number in their responses.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any government assessments.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Capabilities Package. All interested firms should submit capability packages that outline their capability to provide the required purchase of supply items, maintenance services and the management of task orders. Additionally, interested firms should specifically state how they intend to meet the 3-6 month ramp up after contract award and discuss their capability to be fully operational within that time frame. Also, include any comments/suggestions on structuring SDR liability and resolution. The capabilities package should be brief and concise, yet clearly demonstrate an ability to meet the stated requirements. Recent, relevant experience and/or capabilities in all areas should be provided. Recent, relevant experience is defined as performance of the same or similar work within the past three (3) years. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided. The response must not exceed 10 pages. Submit capabilities packages via e-mail to Tammy Tobe; tamara.tobe@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Parts Ordering Repair Service-PROS." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc, or .xls documents are attached to your email.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Questions related to this sources sought synopsis must be submitted via e-mail to the person indicated above NLT COB (Monday, 28 July 2014.) No further questions will be entertained after that date.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN COB Monday, 18 August 2014.<br />The PROS Program Management Office (PMO) will be hosting an Industry Days event for all interested parties. Information about Industry Days will be posted as a separate notice.</span></p>

<DESC><p>The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC), Military Satellite Communications Systems (MILSATCOM) Directorate (MC), Los Angeles Air Force Base, California hereby issues the following Request for Information (RFI).</p>
<p>1.0 Introduction: The United States Government (USG) is pursuing a series of five (5) Pathfinders in support of future Commercial Satellite Communication (COMSATCOM) procurements supporting Department of Defense (DoD) operations. The COMSATCOM Pathfinder series is developing the business and technical capabilities necessary for the USG to more effectively access available satellite communication (SATCOM) resources for the warfighter worldwide. The COMSATCOM Pathfinder series will demonstrate a new paradigm of procuring pre-launch transponder(s) to influence Industry to add desired military capabilities to future COMSATCOM systems while working with the COMSATCOM service provider to access their constellation. Likewise, starting with PF #3 the government is introducing the concept of pooled ground which is defined below. When referencing "ground" throughout this Request for Information (RFI), the USG is referring to a teleport, hub, and backhaul network.</p>
<p>Pathfinder #1 (PF #1) demonstrated the business practice of purchasing COMSATCOM with the procurement of two Ku-band transponders over Africa. Although PF #1 achieved its goals for affordability, the purchased transponders were limited in coverage area and diversity of user base due to limited ground entry point access. Pathfinder #2 (PF #2) will procure pre-launch transponders to maximize affordability and influence future COMSATCOM systems while working with the COMSATCOM service provider to access their constellation. PF #3 will build upon the PF #2 strategy by replicating the concept in an Outside the Continental United States (OCONUS) region. Additionally PF #3 will address the ground issue seen in PF #1 by including a ground segment able to support the satellite pooled bandwidth across the contracted region or Reference Coverage Area (RCA).</p>
<p>2.0 COMSATCOM PF #3: PF #3 will be a competitive acquisition with the procurement of one or more pre-launch, offeror-selected transponders. The USG will then work with the COMSATCOM service provider to access their constellation, which will provide OCONUS coverage to a defined RCA. This process will demonstrate continued investment based affordability techniques and radically improve coverage flexibility by providing access to pooled portable bandwidth across a challenging OCONUS inter-COCOM setting. The Space and Missile Systems Center (SMC) and the Defense Information System Agency (DISA) are collaborating to determine the OCONUS RCA. For the purpose of this RFI, SMC will bound the RCA to European Command (EUCOM), Africa Command (AFRICOM) and Central Command (CENTCOM) regions or potentially a combination of these COCOMs. This RCA is subject to change and will be defined further in future requests. In addition, the USG is exploring alternatives to accessing ground segment capacity through either: 1) the procurement of antennas, 2) acquiring teleport RF and ground network capacity pooling, 3) managed services, or 4) other options deemed feasible by Industry. The intent is to demonstrate the process of procuring ground segment assets as part of a series of risk mitigation steps towards a pooled portable ground segment. These steps are as follows:</p>
<p>2.1 Investment Approach: The procurement of an offeror-selected satellite transponder(s) and/or ground assets afford multiple purposes. The approach demonstrates a long term investment within a constellation or RCA, provides a platform for transponder component demonstration, provides a commercial capability for pooled global bandwidth across a service provider's constellation, and provides a supporting ground segment in the coverage area to efficiently use acquired bandwidth.</p>
<p>2.2 Acquiring Bandwidth/Capacity Phase: The primary goal of PF #3 is to achieve affordability and flexibility of COMSATCOM for the USG. The Air Force will purchase one or more pre-launch transponders and work with the COMSATCOM service provider to access their bandwidth pool. A similar process (by procuring ground assets) will take place for the ground segment contingent within the Offeror's coverage area. Portions of the pool will then be requested, and provided as availability dictates to users throughout the RCA.</p>
<p>2.3 Execution of Bandwidth Allocation: Once the contract is awarded, USSTRATCOM will manage the satellite bandwidth and ground segment assets, and determine which users will have access to the bandwidth/capacity. The government is looking for provider/operator support/input for PF #3 to enable this rapid change in satellite connectivity for a given user.</p>
<p>2.4 Enhancements: The USG implemented CNSSP-12 compliance and anti-burnout enhancements as a requirement for PF #2 with the goal to influence Industry to include these enhancements on future satellites. For PF #3, the USG is encouraging Industry to provide recommendations on other potential enhancements that would be applicable to meet military needs.</p>
<p>3.0 Pooled Portable Satellite Bandwidth: The Total Bandwidth Pool consists of the sum of a Reserved Bandwidth Pool and a Subject to Availability (STA) Bandwidth Pool. The Reserved Bandwidth Pool is dedicated to the USG for the contract Period of Performance (PoP), where the RCA is a subset of OCONUS (defined in section 2.0). The STA Bandwidth Pool is bandwidth that is allocated to the USG on an as-needed and as-available basis over the Offeror's constellation. The amount (in MHz-Months) of the Total Bandwidth Pool is determined by the Offeror. The Total Bandwidth Pool size will most likely be based on each Offeror's unique business case and strategy. The Reserved Bandwidth Pool, in MHz-Months, will be fixed over the contractual period and will expire at the end of that period. The STA Bandwidth Pool will have a starting balance of exactly 1500 MHz-Months, with usable bandwidth as defined by typical commercial specifications and performance. As the USG utilizes the available COMSATCOM services from the Offeror, the balance of the STA Bandwidth Pool will be drawn down on a per use basis. COMSATCOM services via STA bandwidth will be available to the USG until either the contract PoP expires or the balance of the STA Bandwidth Pool is zero.</p>
<p>4.0 Pooled Portable Ground Segment: To prevent limitations for pooled portable satellite bandwidth, PF #3 is expanding from a satellite centric approach to incorporating a pooled portable ground segment that will support warfighters with ground entry point of access. For example, if a warfighter requests satellite access in Afghanistan, the service provider may report they have available satellite bandwidth and provides the warfighter access. However, there may be an inability to provide that service if there is no ground to communicate with that warfighter. One approach is to treat ground in a similar fashion as the on-orbit transponders so as to pool ground capacity in parity with an equivalent ground asset (like an antenna). Another approach is to extend the definition of a portable pool of capability to include satellite and ground connectivity. There are several challenges the USG foresees with either approach. First, achieving parity based on the purchase of a ground asset is less understood than a transponder exchange on a satellite. Second, extending the definition of a portable pool of satellite capability to a portable pool of ground capability for end-to-end capacity is less understood for ground assets. Third, the ground might have the necessary capacity for the requested connectivity (link), but the probability of that ground having a modem that is compatible with the warfighter's modem is negligible, unless pre-planned. Fourth, the data will be routed from the USG networks (e.g., Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN) to the warfighter, and the request for this network connectivity (e.g. commercial/USG network peering points, commercial portion of the network capacity) is unknown until the specific satellite access is requested. This would require the compatible ground segment (including apertures, RF equipment, modems, network devices, terrestrial transport, etc.) to be reserved for all possible satellite links and provisioned in near real time. Expanding a pooled portable ground segment across an OCONUS region will likely create additional challenges. The USG is seeking Industry's input on how to create a pooled portable ground approach.</p>
<p>5.0 Questions for Industry: The USAF requests specific feedback to several questions regarding the proposed pooled portable satellite bandwidth concept and a pooled portable ground segment.</p>
<p>5.1 Pooled Portable Satellite Bandwidth:</p>
<p>5.1.1 - What feedback does Industry have on the advantages/disadvantages regarding the type of band for the transponder(s)?</p>
<p>5.1.1.1 - What launches does Industry have planned for the next two to six year time frame?</p>
<p>5.1.2 - Can Industry provide a reasonable (&gt;36 MHz-Month average) amount of Reserved bandwidth within the satellite RCA identified in Section 2.0?</p>
<p>5.1.3 - Does the STA pool with a total value of 1500 MHz-Month seem reasonable to Industry? If not, why?</p>
<p>5.1.3.1 - Is the ratio of Reserved to STA bandwidth a factor in the pricing of the STA capacity?</p>
<p>5.1.3.2 - How would Industry recommend exercising the portability of the Reserved Pool as well as surging in the STA Pool?</p>
<p>5.1.3.3 - Are there business models that would incentivize Industry to be responsive to the portability and surge needed for warfighting requirements? If so, describe those business models.</p>
<p>5.1.3.4 - What would the process look like for managing the provisioning of bandwidth onto a transponder that would be part of the STA process?</p>
<p>5.1.4 - How would COMSATCOM service providers address the process for determining bandwidth, Power Equivalent Bandwidth, Location, Gain over Temperature, and the relevancy of these parameters in determining the value of pooled bandwidth?</p>
<p>5.1.5 - As part of the pooling concept, the USG would like to have users access multiple in-view satellites within a provider's constellation. What ideas does Industry have on how to approach the movement between satellites using existing/enhanced capability inherent in the operator's current infrastructure?</p>
<p>5.1.6 - What alternative deal structures or lessons learned from PF #2 would Industry recommend in order to meet PF #3 objectives?</p>
<p>5.2 Technology Enhancements</p>
<p>5.2.1 - What satellite or ground enhancements would Industry recommend to meet the military's satellite communications needs?</p>
<p>5.2.1.1 - For those recommendations what are Industry's budget estimates or Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) to implement?</p>
<p>5.2.2.2 - What issues does Industry foresee with encryption technologies from a satellite and ground perspective?</p>
<p>5.3 Pooled Portable Ground Segment:</p>
<p>5.3.1 - Is it possible to pool ground capacity in support of your or other provider's space bandwidth based on the approaches (or others) outlined in the sections above? If so, how?</p>
<p>5.3.2 - What challenges can the USG expect to face in implementing a pooled portable ground segment?</p>
<p>5.3.3 - Is it possible to pool the network backhaul to the closest DoDIN entry point? If so, how?</p>
<p>5.3.4 - Does Industry support USG services today that are routed to the DoDIN? If so, how are those services implemented?</p>
<p>5.3.5 - What would Industry recommend as the process for managing pooled portable ground?</p>
<p>5.3.6 - In reference to the third challenge in Section 4.0 above, what recommendations does Industry have on how a modem pool could be created for Pathfinder #3, and beyond?</p>
<p>5.3.7 - The COMSATCOM Pathfinder vision is supporting the warfighter's connection on a minute-by-minute basis. How would Industry propose optimally pooling ground bandwidth towards this goal? How, as described above, can Industry enhance the user's access to this bandwidth (PF#3 only) through the use of existing command and monitoring capability?</p>
<p>5.3.8 - Can Industry provide the type of modems being used at teleports in the RCA?</p>
<p>5.3.8.1 - Are these modems always in use or can they be shared over time?</p>
<p>5.3.9 - What kind of International challenges such as policies, regulations, Host Nation Agreements etc. can the USG expect to see?</p>
<p>5.3.10 - What are the overall security requirements for a pooled portable ground segment?</p>
<p>5.3.10.1-Does Industry implement Risk Management Framework (RMF) controls? If so, how?</p>
<p>5.3.11 - What overall feedback does Industry have on the approach to incorporate a pooled portable ground segment?</p>

<DESC><br />&nbsp;5"/54 Navy Gun MK 64 Projectile Body Source Sought Notice
<p>Solicitation Number: W52P1J-16-R-0066</p>
<p>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), on behalf of the Project Director Joint Products, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ is issuing a sources sought notice in an effort to identify capable sources for the production and delivery of 5"/54 Navy Gun MK 64 projectile bodies, NSN 1320-01-313-3697; P/N 6573623. The projectile body is a major component of high explosive and training ammunition that is fired from the Navy's 5" Gun System. The Government anticipates that one Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) production contract with 5 available ordering periods will be awarded.</p>
<p>ITEM DESCRIPTION: The 5"/54 Navy Gun MK 64 projectile body is approximately 21" long, has a finished weight of approximately 57 pounds, and is made from 1050 steel with a minimum yield strength of 78,000 psi., and there are additional restrictions on the steel chemistry. The body has a swaged gilding metal rotating band applied to it and a thin steel disc welded to the aft end of it. Due to the fact that the body will later be filled with an explosive, and fired from a naval artillery gun platform, there are rigorous quality assurance requirements including 100% Ultrasonic Inspection, and numerous other 100% inspections.</p>
<p>CRITICAL PROCESSES/SKILLS: Producing these bodies typically requires long stroke, high tonnage forging capability with deep draw expertise, nosing capability, specialized heat treatment capability and precision machining capability. The Technical Data Package requires protective finishing on both the interior and exterior surfaces of the body. The final dimensions of the projectile body have tolerances as tight as 0.005" and specialized gauges are required to measure certain attributes of the body. This item's technical data specifies &lsquo;critical characteristics' which involve specialized inspections, and requires ultrasonic inspection as discussed above. Critical skills required include engineers, billet heating and forge operators, Computer Numerically Controlled (CNC) programmers, machinist, production management, quality inspection personnel, and ultrasonic testing inspection operators. Manufacture of the 5"/54 Navy Gun MK 64 projectile body does require specialized/critical skills or facilities.</p>
<p>RESPONSES: Interested companies who consider themselves capable of manufacturing the 5"/54 Navy Gun MK 64 projectile body, are invited to indicate their interest by providing the U.S. Government with the following information:<br /><br />a. Provide a brief summary of the company's capabilities (a description of the facilities, personnel experience, quality system, and past manufacturing experience) and capacity. <br />b. Identify and include a brief summary of any potential key sub-tier vendors or subcontractors and identify key components or processes that would be subcontracted.</p>
<p>c. Discuss the feasibility of or alternatives to the Government's preferred lead-time of 300 days after award for First Article Test (FAT) Sample and 365 days after award for production deliveries to commence.</p>
<p>d. Provide a rough order of magnitude (ROM) prices for an approximate FY17 production quantity of 5,000 - 25,000 5"/54 Navy Gun MK 64, and a ROM for First Article Test sample.</p>
<p>e. Identify minimum and maximum monthly production quantities and identify the available capacity.</p>
<p>f. Identify your company's size status for the identified NAICS code in your response.</p>
<p>g. Complete the attached MK 64 Projectile Body Questionnaire that is provided as an attachment to this announcement.</p>
<p>NOTICE: The Technical Data Package (TDP) associated with the 5"/54 Navy Gun MK 64 projectile body is classified as Distribution D, limited distribution authorized to the Department of Defense (DOD) and US DOD Contractors Only.

Violations of these export laws are subject to severe criminal penalties. Disseminate in accordance with provisions of DOD Directive 5230.25.</p>

<DESC>A few more questions were asked regarding the SOW. Please see the below questions and answers for more clarification. The answer to each question is in <strong>bold</strong>.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />&nbsp;
<p>1) The Revised Statement of Work, (Section 5) states that full containers shall not exit the rear gate (Sallyport) of the institution until they have been properly secured by the institution for a period not less than 3 institutional counts. Given that removal of self-contained compactors is to occur between 6:30 am and 8:00 am (Section 1), what are the times of the 3 institutional counts that occur after 8:00 am at FCI Waseca?&nbsp; <strong>9 p.m., 12:01 a.m., 3 a.m.,5 a.m., 4 p.m. The institution will secure the compactor prior to the 9 p.m. count</strong></p>
<p>2) Can the Contractor anticipate that the times of the 3 institutional counts following 8:00 am, in response to question 1, above, will remain constant over the term of the contract?&nbsp; <strong>Yes the count times will remain constant.</strong></p>
<p>3) The Revised Statement of Work removes the requirement that an empty 30-yard self-contained compactor be in place at all times for both refuse and organics. Thus, the FCI Waseca is stating that it can be without use of one of its refuse or organics self-contained compactors for the entire period of time it takes to haul a full compactor to the Sallyport, where it sits until 3 institutional counts can be made, and the full compactor is then subsequently hauled to the disposal site and after the contents can be dumped, the empty compactor is hauled back to the FCI Waseca. Can the Contracting Office please clarify the maximum amount of time the FCI Waseca can be without use of a refuse or organics self-contained compactor on the day of service?&nbsp; <strong>FCI Waseca will not be without a compactor at any time. An empty one will be exchanged with the full one, both solid and organics, each time.</strong></p>
<p>4) What is the latest time of day the Contractor's Roll Off Truck will be allowed to enter the FCI Waseca for return of an empty self-contained compactor?&nbsp; <strong>2:30 p.m. is the latest time they will be allowed into the institution. Typically the compactor is picked up between 7:30 - 9:00 a.m.</strong></p>

<DESC>Amendment No. 02: The purpose of this amendment is to extend the proposal due date from 10 November 2016 to 16 November 2016. The due date is being extended due to issues with DARPA's BAA (proposal submission) Website experienced by proposers on 10 November 2016 that prevented proposal submissions from being completed. Those proposers who successfully submitted through DARPA's BAA (proposal submission) Website prior to the original due date are not required to resubmit their proposals as a result of this extension. However, those proposers who did successfully submit through DARPA's BAA (proposal submission) Website prior to the original due date may, if they choose, resubmit their proposals - but the resubmitted proposal must very clearly note that it is being submitted in place of the initial submission. See the attached DARPA-BAA-16-56 document, through Amendment No. 02, with changes highlighted in yellow.

Please share any comments on the pros and cons of keeping such an incentive provision in the contract and having the incentive cover all underwritten beneficiaries and provide an incentive for MTF care. Are there any further revisions you would suggest? If so, please be very specific on details, source of any necessary data, etc.

<DESC>This Market Survey is issued in accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Acquisition Management
System (AMS) Section 3.2.1.2.1.

1. Introduction/Purpose

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is seeking interest from industry participants capable of designing and building Offshore Automation Systems Replacement that will need to support Terminal, En Route and procedural separation (Oceanic) functionality. This market survey is issued for the purposes of determining the viability of alternative solutions based on the high level requirements located in Attachment 1, Market Survey Submission Requirements and Instructions. The FAA Air Traffic Organizations (ATO) mission is to provide safe, secure and efficient air traffic services to commercial, private and military customers operating in the National Airspace System (NAS). The automation systems currently in use at the four offshore facilities, consisting of Anchorage (ZAN) Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), Honolulu Control Facility (HCF) (ZHN), Guam (ZUA) Center Radar Approach Control Facility (CERAP), and San Juan (ZSU) CERAP, need to be replaced with a modern, standardized and scalable NAS platform(s). The offshore facilities currently use a common Surveillance Data Processor (SDP) and site specific Flight Data Processors (FDP) configurations to conduct Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations.  Facilities are able to configure the SDP system functionality based on the type of Air Traffic Services (ATS) that are  required; En Route (includes Offshore/Oceanic procedural control and separation) or Terminal .  The current FDP at the facilities are unique configurations that supply flight data to the facilities with a mixture of FDP equipment and Flight Data Input/Output (FDIO) devices.  

The Offshore Automation System Replacement program is an effort designed to provide automation system solution, or solutions, to the aforementioned offshore facilities that addresses both near-term and future Next Generation Air Traffic System (NextGen) needs, while taking advantage of the benefits of standard platforms, training programs and support. The program plans to utilize Air Traffic Control (ATC) platforms that will meet the air traffic requirements of each offshore site. This program will need to support Terminal, En Route, and procedural separation (Oceanic) functionality and will provide value by implementing a standardized and scalable NAS platform at the offshore facilities to address several shortcomings of the legacy system. The Offshore Automation Systems Replacement program Initial Operating Capability (IOC) is expected between FY 2019-2021. The program will also consider dependencies on key programs being deployed according to their current schedules.  

Operational and technical descriptions for each site and high level draft requirements for the Offshore Automation Systems Replacement are provided in Attachment 1, Market Survey Submission Requirements and Instructions.

A new Unit Information Sheet is now available which replaces the original entirely.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;Vendors are advised that if they cannot attend the scheduled site visit, they may visit the site unaccompanied at any time weather conditions safely allow.&nbsp; All of the units are flagged with both yellow-and-white-striped flagging and bright green flagging, and all additional cut trees are marked with green marking paint.&nbsp; Mr. Braley remains the point of contact for questions about site access, or to request an accompanied visit.&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />PRESOLICITATION NOTICE AND SAVE-THE-DATE-------<br /><br />A full solicitation is anticipated with a yet-to-be-determined posting date. This notice will be amended to post the solicitation and its attachments. The purpose of this early pre-solicitation is to alert interested parties to a ***SITE VISIT*** occurring in NOVEMBER 2016.
<p>The solicitation will be set-aside at least to small business and may be further set aside to a specific type of small business concern.</p>
<p>Project Description:<br />The objective of this project is to hand thin and pile standing conifer trees and some pre-existing down woody material as part of ongoing aspen, oak, and pine enhancement projects. The project is comprised of 12 units totaling 60 acres. 7 of these units have had commercial conifer trees and biomass removed via timber sales within the limits of mechanical operability. The remaining 5 units have not received any recent treatment.<br />In all units: Live White fir, Incense cedar, Red fir, and Lodgepole pine trees within a specified diameter breast height (DBH) range are to be felled. These DBH ranges are shown by unit in the attached Table 1. In addition to felling trees within specified diameter ranges, other cut trees up to 29.9 inches will be designated for cutting using green marking paint. These additional cut trees are located in direct proximity to aspen trees. Hardwoods, Ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, Sugar pine, Western white pine, and Douglas fir trees are not to be cut unless painted with a green band at DBH. Contractors shall conduct operations so as not to unnecessarily damage residual leave trees. Where boles of cut trees taper to 10 inches in diameter or less, they shall be cut into segments that are no longer than 6 feet in length and piled. Bole material that is greater than 10 inches in diameter shall be left in place on the ground and is not to be piled.<br />All activity created material between 2 and 10 inches in diameter shall be piled, as well as all limbs/branches of cut trees greater than 0.5 inches in diameter. All pre-existing down woody material between 2 and 10 inches in diameter shall be piled except material on logging skid trails and landings. Piles may not be placed within aspen stands, wetlands, stream channels, or meadows and must be placed away from residual live conifers and hardwoods.</p>
<p>Access:<br />The project area is located at two main sites: One unit is located on the east side of Philbrook Reservoir while the remaining 11 units are found to the north, both in and adjacent to Coon Hollow. The project units range from 48 to 54 miles from the Almanor Ranger District Office; 33 miles of which are travelled via Highway 36 West and Highway 32 West. The units are then accessed via County and Forest Service roads. Most of the units can be directly accessed from the road, however, some require a walk-in of 0.1 to 0.4 miles.</p>
<p>Estimated start date:<br />June 1, 2017. Actual start date may vary due to weather and ground conditions. Contract time has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Road Conditions to All Units:<br />The specified roads are accessible by a four-wheel drive vehicle when road conditions are favorable. Inaccessibility due to snow, fallen trees, mudslides, or washouts may occur.</p>
<p>***Scheduled Site Visit:<br />A site visit is scheduled for November 14, 2016 at 8:00 AM Pacific Time, weather permitting, starting at the Almanor Ranger District Office at 900 E Highway 36, Chester, CA 96020. The Site Visit Point of Contact is Jesse Braley. Jesse can be contacted at jessedbraley@fs.fed.us or (530) 258-5167. It is highly recommended that interested parties contact Mr. Braley to communicate intent to attend the site visit, and to provide contact information, so that timely communication may occur should the site visit need to be rescheduled.***</p>
<p>Interested parties may, if desired, also indicate their interest by email to Sandra Vincent at svincent02@fs.fed.us. No proposals are requested until after the full solicitation has been posted. Interested parties will receive email notification when the project is solicited. Alternatively, interested parties may subscribe to this notice on FBO.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions from interested parties.
How was the determination made, relative to integrated pest management (IPM), that pest operators are suitable for treating Veterans and/or VA personnel wardrobe (a person's entire collection of clothes.)? 

VA RESPONSE:  This statement refers to our facility housing up to 250 Domiciliary Residents in Building 160 and 70 Residents in the Community Living Center Building 162, and 104 inpatient beds, besides the annual pest control treatments they may have to treat individual resident rooms which are living quarters outfitted with wardrobe units, dressers, beds, etc. The technician has the responsibility to provide site-specific recommendations for structural and procedural modifications to aid in pest prevention and application. One example would be the use of non-chemical control methods such as traps or such devices in patient care areas. All ward and domiciliary patient lockers receive special application of a long-term residual pesticide on a semi-annual basis.

Are washers and dryers available in the immediate vicinity where VA patients or personnel wardrobes are placed or stored? If so, will awardee have access to utilize washers and dryers for IPM purposes? 

VA RESPONSE:  There are laundry facilities at both locations where the Residents are responsible for laundering their personal clothing. When such pest control issues arise patient clothing is laundered on site with VA employee assistance. The awardee will not have access to the washers and dryers as it will not be necessary.
Incumbent contractor:  Terminix

FY16 contract award:  $19,128.00.

<p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">C. Planned Acquisition and Additional Requirements: </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The objective for NAVSEA is a 4 to 5 year development of MK 48 MOD 7 TI-1 with Initial Operational Capability in Fiscal Year (FY) 24. A contract award is now anticipated in the second quarter of FY18.</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The Government is proposing a hardware development approach that involves Engineering Demonstration Model (EDM), Proof of Design (POD), and Proof of Manufacture (POM) deliverables prior to entering Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). For EDMs, the only required deliverable is a Guidance and Control Box (GCB), which will support early Government bench-top testing and Operational Software (OPSW) integration with the Advanced Capability (ADCAP) Software Test Bed (AST). This GCB EDM can be a functionally equivalent unit and although desirable, does not need to meet all form and fit requirements (i.e., a functioning rack mount system would be acceptable).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For the POD and POM deliverables, complete G&amp;C Sections, TI-1 Warhead Electronics System (WES) Kits, and Improved Post Launch Communications (IPLCS) Kits will be required which meet all form, fit and functional requirements. Approval to proceed with EDM development will be predicated on an approved System Functional Review (SFR) baseline, approval to proceed with POD development will be predicated on an approved Preliminary Design Review (PDR) baseline, and approval to proceed with POM development will be predicated on an approved Critical Design Review (CDR) baseline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">It is anticipated that 3-4 years of DT/OT testing with POD, POM &amp; LRIP hardware will be required in order to meet current Initial Operation Capability (IOC) requirement of FY24.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to meet current testing objectives, EDM deliveries are required to begin 7 months after contract award, POD deliveries are required to begin 22 months after contract award, and POM deliveries are required 16 months after initial POD deliveries (38 months after contract award).</span></p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">The updated TI-1 performance specifications no longer specify an element count. Prospective Contractors can propose any array architecture / element count up to 560 which meets all performance requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, an array consisting of more than 128 elements will require upgrades to the existing Government infrastructure and will ultimately cause the Government to incur additional costs for upgrading impacted equipment. Accordingly, when evaluating Contractor proposals that specify element counts greater than 128, the Government may take into consideration additional Government Total Ownership Costs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Criteria for evaluating such costs would be specified in any Request for Proposals resulting from this RFI.</span></p>

<DESC><p>The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) intends to issue a solicitation for the design, development, integration, test, and delivery of the Inter Subsystem Monitoring Tool (ISMT) and On-Board Team Trainer Master Controller (OBTT-MC) applications. ISMT and OBTT will be hosted by the Common Infrastructure Services (CIS) subsystem within the Submarine Warfare Federated Tactical System (SWFTS) and are intended to support efforts for the following Technology Insertion (TI) and Advanced Processing Build (APB) development cycles: TI-18/APB17, TI-18/APB19, TI-20/APB19, TI-20/APB21, and TI-22/APB21. The OBTT application provides end-to-end integrated sensor and combat system operator training through simulated navigation, mathematical modeling of ownship parameters and maneuvering capabilities, and creation of simulated threat and non-threat contact elements. ISMT is responsible for monitoring all SWFTS Systems of Systems (SOS) interfaces, services, and network health. ISMT alerts operators when a fault or failure has occurred and provides recovery support to the sailor. ISMT also provides access to the SWFTS network backbone (i-Net). The top level requirements for OBTT-MC and ISMT are part of the CIS Performance Specification.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a single contract for this effort and anticipates&nbsp;solicitation release&nbsp;in&nbsp;November of Calendar year 2016.</p>
<p>Based on the complexity, magnitude, and duration of the requirement, the Government's market research indicated there are two (2) or more small business concerns capable of competing for the requirement as a small business set aside (FAR 19.502-2). This procurement will be conducted using small business set aside competition in accordance with FAR Subpart 6.203.</p>
<p>NOTE: This is a pre-solicitation notice intended to provide potential offerors with a summary of the subject procurement. This notice is for information only, is subject to modification and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to solicit contractual offers or award contracts. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. If a solicitation is issued in the future, it will be announced via the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) page located at <a href="http://www.fbo.gov/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://www.fbo.gov</span></a> and interested parties must comply with that announcement. Interested offerors should monitor the identified website for updates to this procurement.</p>

Justification and Approval (J&A)
For
Other Than Full and Open Competition (>$150K)

Acquisition Plan Action ID:__ VA263-16-AP-6562_______________________

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, NCO 23, Sioux Falls Services Team 636-17-1-4045-0003.

Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed:  Service contract for preventative and emergency maintenance, including parts, glassware, and detector coverage of the Siemens Artis Zee Bi-Plane Interventional Radiology system at the Iowa City VA Health Care System.

Description of Supplies/Services Required to Meet the Agency s Needs:  Service contract for preventive and emergency maintenance of the Siemens Artis Zee Bi-Plane Interventional Radiology system at the Iowa City VA Health Care System.  The current contract expires 10/31/16.  The new contract needs to include the provision for 2 option years.  The vendor providing the required services must be capable of performing preventative and emergency maintenance on the Siemens Artis Zee Bi-Plane Interventional Radiology system according to the original manufacturer s specifications.  The new contract must be awarded effective 11/1/16 to avoid a lapse in coverage.  The estimated cost of these services is $135,000/year or $405,000 for the base year plus two option years.

Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition:  

 ( X )  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
        Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1; 41 U.S.C. 3304(a)(1)

Demonstration that the Contractor s Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority):   This system has proprietary software.  The proprietary software keys used for troubleshooting are only accessible to Siemens/Cassling Diagnostic Imaging personnel. 

Description of Efforts Made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as deemed practicable:  To my knowledge, there are no other companies that are able to offer this service due to the unavailability of software maintenance access.  I have performed internet searches, checked the HISD website which houses the approved Site to Site agreements, and also checked with peers in the VA.

Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable:  Based on industry standards, software support for medical equipment typically is charged at a rate anywhere from 5-10% of the acquisition price of the asset.  The assets included in this contract are worth $1,893,000, so a  fair  contract cost should be anywhere from $92,000 to $183,000.

Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or a Statement of the Reasons Market Research Was Not Conducted:  To my knowledge, there are no other companies that are able to offer this service due to the unavailability of software maintenance access, and the level of security clearance and approvals needed for the VPN connection.  I have performed internet searches, checked the HISD website which houses the entire approved Site to Site agreements, and also checked with peers in the VA.


Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other than Full and Open Competition:  There are no other actions the VA can take to increase competition for this scenario.  Any potential companies wishing to qualify for this procurement would have to obtain national site to site agreements with VA OI&T.

Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  Cassling Diagnostics Imaging/Siemens Medical

A Statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making subsequent acquisitions for the supplies or services required:  When replacement equipment is procured, the process will once again be done competitively.

<DESC>The United States Agency for International Development in Uganda (USAID/Uganda) intends to make a follow-on sole source award to the incumbent contractor, The QED Group, LLC for approximately $4,500,000. Contract # AID-617-C-13-00007 with The QED Group, LLC is a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee (CPFF) completion type with the period of performance of 06/24/2013 to 06/23/2018.  The TEC Increase to this existing Contract services USAID/Uganda through three core components:<br />MONITORING &amp; EVALUATION: Provides technical assistance to USAID/Uganda and its implementing partners to strengthen monitoring and evaluation capacity, promote evidence-based programming and management, enhance analytical rigor, and evaluate activities and projects.<br />LEARNING &amp; ADAPTATION: Supports USAID/Uganda and its implementing partners to improve organizational practices and capacity for learning and adaptation within staff and processes. This includes conducting organizational network analyses, supporting learning networks, conducting learning reviews, and documenting and facilitating events that promote adaptive management.<br />COORDINATION, COLLABORATION, AND SYNERGY: Works to facilitate collaboration, strengthen stakeholder networks, and broaden relationships with the private sector, the Government of Uganda, and donor partners.<br />USAID/Uganda has recently completed its second iteration of country development cooperative strategy (CDCS 2.0). The Learning Contract has been instrumental in supporting the Mission in developing its through learning reviews, evaluations of activities, launching studies and analysis, hosting stakeholder events and information dissemination. Launching a competition at this stage of the activity would result in an unacceptable delay in transitioning from USAID/Uganda's current CDCS 1.0 to the new strategy. This TEC increase is intended to support the Mission to pivot its current activities and design new activities that are aligned to the new CDCS 2.0. The support will be through continued learning reviews and assessments, management restructuring, embedding systems and integration into new designs; assist in developing a strategy level performance management and learning plan; and socialize the CDCS 2.0 approach to the Mission and implementing partners. Such continuity is critical to USAID to maintain the above mentioned services.
<p>The statutory authority permitting the award without providing full and open competition is AIDAR 706.302-70(a) (2), which says that "full and open competition need not be obtained when it would impair or otherwise have an adverse effect on programs conducted for the purpose of foreign aid, relief and rehabilitation." It further states in 706.302-70(b) (5) that this authority may be used for "an award for the continued provision of highly specialized services when award to another resource would result in substantial additional costs to the Government or would result in unacceptable delays." QED has worked closely with USAID/Uganda for over 18 months in the formulation of the new CDCS strategy. The resulting strategy is a marked departure from the traditional approach taken by the earlier CDCS. It is a proactive and innovative strategy that focuses on integration and systems approach across the Mission that is beneficial to USAID. The development of this approach is the result of intensive research, analysis and consultation by QED and the Mission. The understanding, thinking and reasoning behind the approach uniquely places QED to further assist the Mission as it transitions from its current CDCS to the new one. It would be difficult for other sources to gain the same level of intimate understanding and knowledge in a timely manner to support the Mission with its transition.</p>
<p>No solicitation package or a request for competitive proposals will be issued. It has been determined that The QED Group, LLC is the only source for the aforementioned services that meets USAID'S requirements and provides the best value.</p>
