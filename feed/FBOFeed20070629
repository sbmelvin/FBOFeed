<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Health Resources and Services Administration(HRSA) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, The University of Texas at San Antonio(UTHSCSA). 

The purpose of this effort is two-fold; the first task is to identify and develop a      Resource Guidebook of Model Programs along the U.S. Mexican border that have increased the number of disadvantaged and minority students into health professions and
improved women, infant, and child health , oral health, environmental and public health.
The Model Programs will be featured at the United States-Mexico Border Centers of Excellence Consortium(Consortium) Forum. The second task is to provide exposure activities to medical, dental, pharmacy, and behavioral and mental health students and faculty on border primary health care, environmental, and public health concerns through various mechanisms, including clinical rotations, internships and border health training.

The (UTHSCA) developed the U.S.-Mexico Border Center of Excellence Consortium through an initial one-year contract. It is ranked among the top five in graduating Mexican-American students and has more Hispanic faculty than any other medical school. No other institution or organizations have developed the necessary linkages and programs with border health organizations, institutions of higher education, and health professions schools enrolling significant number of Hispanic students. The UTHSCA is the only organization that has the network, contacts and infrastructure to accomplish the proposed activities of the project in the required time frame. The UTHSCA is uniquely qualified to develop the partnership and collaboration with various agencies and programs along the border because they conducted the first and second phases of the U.S.-Mexican Border Center of Excellence Consortium. I addition, the UTHSCA developed the theoretical framework and strategic plan of the Consortium . The UTHSCA possesses proprietary health professions data that is required in the final report and product. The UTHSCA also has the necessary expertise and knowledge of the data required to produce the outcomes of this project. Any other organization would have to duplicate this data at a substantial cost to the Government to perform this requirement. This justification for other than Full and Open Competition is processed under the authority in 41 U.S.C. 253(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.This is not a solicitation. It is anticipated that a one (1) year contract with a base year and four(4) option years will result from these negotiations.  See Note 22

<DESC>Notification of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract.  The Office of Research Integrity (ORI) intends to award a sole source contract to The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS), to develop a framework for integrating RCR training in graduate programs and support the implementation of that framework at five major research universities in a two-year demonstration.  The project will also further the development of an RCR leadership cadre of graduate deans and produce a monograph describing the implementation of the framework by the five universities, the problems and issues encountered, and the best practices to follow in addressing those problems and issues.  The monograph will be widely distributed within the academic community to promote the integration of RCR training into graduate education.

The institutionalization of RCR training in graduate education requires a labor-intensive, prolonged effort that includes the following services:

-A pre-planning committee meeting between CGS senior staff and ORI staff
-Establishing a planning committee composed of graduate deans from major research universities and RCR experts
-Organizing four meetings of the planning committee
-Developing a framework for integrating RCR training into graduate programs
-Developing a request for applications for demonstration projects
-Establishing a selection committee to review applications
-Organizing review of the applications
-Making awards to five major research universities
-Establishing an email network for communicating to awardee and affiliate institutions those that remain in the project without funding
-Holding telephone conference for awardee and affiliate institutions
-Organizing four meetings per year for awardee and affiliate institutions
-Creating an interactive website with resources and forums for exchanging information and advice
-Maintaining a steady flow of information about the project, RCR and research integrity to all graduate deans
-Developing an RCR leadership cadre of graduate deans
-Producing a monograph describing the demonstrations, the problems and issues encountered, and the best practices for addressing the problems and issues.
-Conducting an ongoing campaign to attract private funding for the effort after government funding ends
-Organizing a capstone conference to present project results and a plan for ongoing efforts to promote RCR in graduate education

The Council of Graduate Schools is the only national organization in the United States solely committed to the advancement of graduate education.  CGS is the professional association for graduate schools and graduate deans whose cooperation is essential for successful completion of this project.

To this end, RM currently has installed 2 Network Appliance Filers in its DevNet computer center in Charleston for development and testing of these applications.  With the recent move into production of the GFMS financial system, the DevNet environment must be capable of storing a production mirror copy (for testing purposes) of the GFMS Financial and Data Warehouse databases.  This requirement places additional storage demands on the already stretched DevNet filers. The Departments production financial application databases are stored on Network Appliance Filers.  These applications include RFMS, GFMS, the GFMS Data Warehouse, and the USAID Phoenix financial system.  Network Appliance filers have been used in Charleston production operations for the past 5 years.  These filers mirror data daily to companion filers located at the COOP site in located in BIMC. Filers used in the DevNet environment must be 100% compatible with the production filers in order to ensure consistency in testing and production simulation operations<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Martin Kruger, Program Officer, Phone (703) 696-5349, Email krugerm@onr.navy.mil - Julie DeStefano, Contract Specialist, Phone (703) 696-7826, Email destefj@onr.navy.mil
<DESC>Synopsis:  The Transparent Urban Structures (TUS) program will develop measurable advances for improving the collection, understanding, and dissemination of intelligence for the urban conflict.  ONR seeks to develop technology which assists the warfighter in understanding the urban terrain of interest by detecting and classifying threats, both inside buildings and underground, and by maximizing situational awareness inside structures.  The key focus of this program is to develop advanced technologies that make urban man-made structures transparent, thereby eliminating the safe harbor that buildings provide to hostile forces and their malicious activities.  This capability will be provided through basic phenomenological research, hardware, and algorithm development of sense-through-wall technology that can directly support tactical expeditionary urban operations in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).  Sense-through-wall systems resulting from this research will enable the Marine Corps, Special Operations, and the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command (NECC) to execute their urban warfighting philosophies. Resultant technology developed through this program will be integrated into emerging net-centric Navy and Marine Corps Command & Control and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C2 and ISR) acquisition programs through a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) .  

This BAA opportunity is the second yearly advertisement for the Transparent Urban Structures program.  Last year an initial group of performers were chosen to start working towards the goals of the program.  Respondents to this BAA should concentrate on the capabilities described in 6.4.  

In addition, intelligence gained through use of TUS developed technology will enable the warfighter to introduce facility network information into the analysis of hostile human networks. It should be noted, that this program builds upon and is complementary to the other Department of Defense sense-through-walls programs: DARPA  VisiBuilding, and Army CERDEC-I2WD  Sense-Through-the-Wall (STTW).

<DESC>DARPA is soliciting innovative research and development (R&D) proposals in the area of Micro Inertial Navigation Technology (MINT).  Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.  Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

The overall goal of this program is to create navigation sensors that use secondary inertial variables, such as velocity, to enable long term precise navigation that a traditional IMU equipped only with accelerometers and gyros cannot accomplish. This program seeks the creation of micro and nano scale low-power navigation sensors that allow long term (hours to days) GPS denied precision navigation.  The sensors should be small enough to be placed in small compartments, such as the shoe sole or small UAVs, where zero relative velocity measurement may be accomplished with high accuracy. The power consumption of the sensors should be small, ideally compatible with energy harvested during locomotion, so that the weight load due to batteries powering the sensors is minimized. The sensor technology should work over wide temperature range and shock environment that is typical in DOD applications

Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center) located in Cambridge, Massachusetts intends to procure on a sole source basis under statutory authority of FAR Part 6.302 Circumstances Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition, an award for a contract with a base period of performance of one year, and two one-year option periods for an Online Electronic Library service of Pipeline Specifications and Standards with Information Handling Services (IHS). Market research shows that IHS is the only supplier of the Pipeline standards and specifications required. The Volpe Center is tasked to acquire, implement, and manage the electronic library and subscription of required specifications and standards for the pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration Office (PHMSA). The PHMSA State Program electronic distribution of regulatory specifications and standards data was a project started in 2001 by the Office of Pipeline Safety. The electronic distribution of regulatory data and industry standards is one of the steps OPS has taken and continues to provide to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of inspection and enforcement activities. The contractor will: 1) provide, via the Internet, online network access to the specifications and standards, 2) provide automatic updates to the specifications and standards as the update becomes available, 3) maintain the ability to publish online the specifications and standards from the NFPA,  AGA and  ASTM standards organizations, and 4) provide full integration with the existing Internet application in use by the State Pipeline Partners called State Pipeline Processing System (SPPS).  The Custom Collection Intraspex network service, a proprietary server, will be provided as a multi-site subscription. This service will be provided on an annual subscription basis and the system will be updated daily.  This procurement will be conducted under Commercial Item Acquisition procedures in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 519190.  The small business size standard is $6.5 million.  Interested firms have 15 calendar days from the date of this synopsis publication to submit in writing to the above named point of contact, clear and convincing documentation of their company?s capability to provide required services. Such documentation will be utilized solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Firms will be required to submit a maximum of three (3) but not less than two (2) pages of documentation in support of the above for evaluation prior to receiving a solicitation. This proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority in FAR Part 6.302 as referenced above. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses received to this notice would normally be considered, solely for the purpose of determining whether to reissue as a competitive procurement. The Request for Proposal (RFP) issuance to the above identified firm will be on or about July 16, 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source contract to Carleton Life Support Systems (CLSS, Davenport, Iowa) on a sole source basis to provide assembly, testing, and technical and logistical support to the Naval Special Warfare (NSW) MK 16 Mod 0 Underwater Breathing Apparatus (UBA) Phase III Modernization/Wellness Program.  This procurement includes installation and testing of modernization upgrade kits to the MK 16 Mod 0 UBA, further referred to as the MK 16 Mod 3 UBA.  The upgrade kit includes all mechanical, electrical and electronic improvements necessary to implement the upgrade on the MK 16.  This procurement also includes test equipment and consumable spare parts to maintain the MK 16 Mod 3 UBA for approximately 2 years.  Carleton Technologies/CLSS will also provide the necessary labor and resources required to provide Operators and Maintenance training sufficient to provide the necessary information, skill development!  , and practical application required by the student to set up, check out, operate and perform preventative maintenance on the Mk 16 Mod 3 UBA.   These MK 16 Mod 3 UBAs are being refurbished and reconfigured for delivery to the fleet.  This procurement also includes options for 132 sets of MK 16 Mod 0 and Mod 1 wellness components and for 30 MK 16 Mod 0/Mod 1 wellness kits.  Wellness components/kits consist of replacing obsolete components with supportable units.   This procurement also includes options for fifteen (15) follow on upgraded MK 16 Mod 3 UBAs, as well as assembly and delivery of thirty-six (36) Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Next Generation Underwater Breathing Apparatus (NUBA).   A NUBA is defined as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) MK 16 UBA with an upgrade kit installed.   The upgrade will modernize the electronics to a digital system, increasing reliability while reducing dive setup time and cost.  This procurement is sole source for the following rea!  sons.  Carleton Technologies/CLSS is the Original Equipment Manufactur er (OEM) of the MK 16 UBA.  As the OEM, only Carleton Technologies/CLSS can accurately perform all of the refurbishments and upgrades to the MK 16 to successfully transition the system to MK 16 Mod 3 and NUBA respectively.  The MK 16 is a certified life support system.  As such, only approved components can be used on the system.  In summary, Carleton Technologies/CLSS is the only responsible source due to their unique qualifications as sole manufacturer of the MK16 UBA.  Use of another company to refurbish and reconfigure the currently fielded UBAs would result in extensive re-qualification and certification testing which is cost and time prohibitive. Other sources interested in qualifying their products for future acquisitions should contact Theresa Lang at 850-235-5772.  Award will be made based on responsible proposal, on or about 30 Sep 07.   Delivery will be made to NSWC PC. NAICS Code: 541990, Size Standard: 500 employees, PSC Code: 4220

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City (NSWC PC) intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Primagraphics Limited (dba Curtiss Wright Controls), 1000 Research Park Boulevard, Suite 106, Charlottesville, VA 22911 for the acquisition of one Radar VME Card (p/n SYS-C267-0-00056) .  This equipment will be used on the Navigation, Command and Control System (AN/SSN-2(V)5).  This procurement is sole source for the following reasons.  Primagraphics Limited is the sole manufacturer for these items.  Currently, drawings or specifications are not available.  The AN/SSN-2(V)5 system has already gone through and passed environmental and shock testing with this part installed.  Once a system is certified, nothing can be altered without further testing and approval from the Program Office.  NSWC PC has been assigned as the In-Service Engineering Activity and tasked to procure interim support parts; so, time is an issue.  Using alternate equipment would prove costly in tim!  e and dollars to the government and to the mission.  Use of another system may change or introduce new parameters that may be harmful to the AN/SSN-2(V)5 system.  Therefore it is imperative that these items are acquired from Primagraphics Limited.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for BENDATA-V4-LX160-11-A daughtercards (4 Each) and BenOne-PCI carrier cards (4 Each) with a 12 month extended support. NASA/JSC intends to purchase the items from Nallatech.	Nallatech cards are compatible with the development system used at Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and at Johnson Space Center (JSC).  Using Nallatech cards will allow for continuing collaborative development of communications algorithms between the two centers in support of the Constellation program.  By using the same platform and architecture as JPL there will be a maximum reuse of code and minimum redevelopment of the relatively complex algorithms being developed.  The cards provide Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) programming through the Peripheral Component Interconnet (PCI) adapter that will be used extensively during development and during operation as Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) image will be reloaded each time to reconfigure for testing.	Nallatech is the only vendor that can provide and meet technical requirements. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 03, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement to procure the Orthogonal Frequency Coded (OFC) Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Sensor Study.  SAW tags are required for use in sensor and Radio Frequency Identifications (RFID) applications. This innovation is likely to benefit a number of NASAs Constellation Program applications, surface navigation, and several critical sensor applications. Passive wireless sensors signals tend to collide with each other when a large number of tags are illuminated at the same time.  The OFC SAW tags offer a different approach to orthogonality through coding for SAW devices.  Additionally, the SAW device is well suited for Ultra-Wideband RFID, which is inherently better suited for high accuracy tracking applications.	The requirements/specifications are detailed in the attached Statement of Work at:  http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/NNJ07205439Q/Document.pdf   NASA/JSC intends to purchase the study from the University of Central Florida based on the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(2)(b), only one source reasonably available.  The wideband SAWs with Orthogonal Frequency Coding are expected to be highly advantageous for various applications in NASAs exploration effort.  The technology has been demonstrated in VHF band, however, further research and development are required to extend the technology to higher frequencies in order to meet NASA applications requirements.  Professor Donald Malocha at the University of Central Florida developed the innovation under a NASA Small Business Technology Transfer Program (STTR) contract.  There are no other known sources for this procurement. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	See Note 26. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 1:30 p.m. local time on July 12, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate a sole source purchase order under Simplified Acquisition Procedures to Ingenuity Systems, 1700 Seaport Blvd. Redwood City, CA 94063 for the acquisition of four Ingenuity Pathways Analysis concurrent license for one year with unlimited user accounts. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis Software is a web-based application that enables researchers to explore, understand, and discover relevant networks significant to their research results. Using a researcher's gene or protein dataset in combination with  Ingenuity's genome-scale knowledge base, the application generates multiple biologic networks with an associated functional analysis to facilitate biological understanding of the dataset. Specifically it: A. supports genomic and proteomic data analysis; B. enables discovery of novel genes, proteins  and interactions (canonical) pathways; C. allows expansion of pathways to identify putative targets; D. contains manually curated pathways from full-text scientific literature (Not just abstracts); E. allows comparisons of 2 groups of pathways; F. allows user creation of a pathway from a set of  genes; G. develops pathways from an input genelist on the "fly", meaning it develops a pathway from just that set of genes and no others. This is a unique Pathway Analysis software that allows researchers to view their data in terms of networks of pathways in an "interactomic fashion". There are no  pathways analysis packages on the market today that contains the depth of annotated pathways as provided by Ingenuity Pathway Software. This software is presently being used to support an ongoing research project at EPA. As such, it is required for continuity of data analyses for the project.  In  order to ensure data compatibility and accuracy the circumstance permitting is FAR 13.106(B) "only one source reasonably available".  The intent of this notice is to determine if any other source(s) exist, and therefore, no solicitation (RFQ) is available.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Office on Women?s Health (OWH) has a requirement to expand a multidisciplinary approach to consumer health education to additional diverse audiences in the Philadelphia area.  The Government intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Drexel University?s Women?s Health Education Program, Philadelphia, PA 19129 to address health disparities among African Americans by evaluating a community focused women?s health education workshop series on various topics and assessing the likelihood of perception for behavior change.

This acquisition shall be awarded in accordance with FAR Subpart 13  Simplified Acquisition Procedures and has been justified in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b).  Drexel University?s Women?s Health Education Program (WHEP) has a long history and commitment to investigating and developing educational remedies for clinicians to address women?s health disparities.  The WHEP is a program of the Drexel University College of Medicine?s Department of Medicine that strives to improve the health of women by promoting girls? and women?s health issues in the medical curriculum, thus spearheading innovations in medical education, and translating women?s health education into community programming. The Women?s Health Education Program has extensive experience in health disparities issues for women and has conducted numerous outreach programs educating about barriers to care, beliefs about the health care system, communication skills, risk perception of disease and health advocacy. Since Drexel has pioneered this project, they are justifiably the only ones in the Philadelphia area who can complete the efficacy of the project. In addition, WHEP has experience in promoting changes in the medical curriculum by evaluating a community-focused Women?s Health Education Workshop Series on various topics and assessing the likelihood of perception for behavior change to address health disparities among African Americans in Philadelphia. The Drexel University has piloted this project with two previous workshops.  This multidisciplinary approach is still in the developmental stage and being targeted in the Philadelphia area before it can be generalized to other cities.

<DESC>BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE COUNTERINTELLIGENCE FIELD ACTIVITY BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE DIRECTORATE 
APPLIED BEHAVIORAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE 

I. INTRODUCTION

The Department of Defense Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA) Behavioral Science Directorate solicits new proposals for its 4th Qtr fiscal year 2007 and FY 2008 contract program of applied research in behavioral and social science. This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is issued per FAR 35.106.  A formal Request for Proposal will not be issued.  

The CIFA contracting officer will not issue paper copies of this announcement. CIFA reserves the right to select for award and to fund all, some, or none of the full proposals received in response to this solicitation.  No funding for direct reimbursement of proposal development costs will be allowed.  Technical and cost proposals, or any other material, submitted in response to this BAA will not be returned.  CIFA will adhere to FAR policy on handling source selection information and proprietary proposals.  It is the policy of CIFA to treat all proposals as sensitive competitive information, and to disclose their contents only for the purpose of evaluation. 

Awards, if any, will take the form of contracts.  In the event an offeror is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), Department of Energy National Laboratory, or other Federally funded entity, the CIFA contracting officer will work with the appropriate sponsoring agency to issue an interagency agreement pursuant to the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1531) or other appropriate authority.  

II. OVERVIEW

The purpose of the research is (1) to develop, test and evaluate the application (translation) of known principles and findings of the behavioral and social sciences to enhancing capabilities relevant to current and future intelligence, counter-intelligence, and human intelligence collection; and (2) to understand threats to national security in terms of the principles and methods of the social and behavioral sciences.  A portion of the funding may be made available for meritorious proposals from minority institutions and historically Black colleges and universities, and these entities are encouraged to participate.  

No consideration can be given to purely fundamental (basic) research projects (e.g., mechanisms of memory, affect or performance).  However, support will be given to projects that have both basic and applied components; for example, where investigations in laboratory settings help us to understand specific complexities in the field, or where basic and applied approaches are directed concurrently at the same problem.  

Each proposal will be evaluated by a government technical team in accordance with the criteria established herein.  Those proposals determined to be responsive to the BAA, receive high technical ratings and are identified as complementing current research in service to ongoing CIFA operations will be given priority for funding.  Proposals that are responsive and receive high technical ratings may also be funded but will generally be given a lower priority.

CIFA Behavioral Sciences Directorate

The Mission of the Behavioral Science Directorate is collaboration with DoD CI customers, stakeholders, and a broad range of behavioral scientists to produce high caliber behavioral and social science consultation services, training, and research and analytic products, that uniquely improve the quality of counterintelligence (CI) operations, investigations, and analyses.

The research component of the Behavioral Sciences Directorate of CIFA supports research projects conducted in the private (industry and academic) sector in support of investigations, consultations, teaching and training relevant to the CIFA Mission. This research is primarily focused on:  (i) developing and evaluating reliable, valid, behavior-based methods of evidence and human intelligence sources ssessment; (ii) developing and evaluating methods for understanding terrorist groups and their relationships to populations of interest; and (iii) methods for the translation principles and models in the social and behavioral sciences developed in laboratory settings to field and operational settings.

III. BAA RESEARCH AREAS OF INTEREST

CIFAs areas of interest for this Broad Agency Announcement are outlined in Secitons A through E below.  Research involving human subjects conducted on behalf of a CIFA may be undertaken only with the informed consent of the subject, in accordance with guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, setting out conditions that safeguard the welfare of such subjects.   The methods, data and all analyses will be unclassified.

A.	Counter-Surveillance Detection Tool

At present there are no standardized instruments for behavioral assessments of sources within the field or operational setting. There is ongoing need to develop instruments and methods for source assessment and to determine whether an individual is engaged in or under surveillance. The purpose of this Area of Interest is to evaluate, via field testing, scientifically valid and culturally sensitive Commercial Off the Shelf Software and government-funded instruments that have been developed to aid case officers engaged in assessing sources and detecting surveillance. Evaluations will require interviews with training and operational personnel engaged in behavioral assessments within operational settings to characterize current practices and itemize what practitioners? needs are.  The goal would be to reach consensus among the operational/user community as to which methods or tools are most useful. 

B.	Cultural Training Tools

In inter-cultural interviews, even when the interviewer can speak the language of the interviewee, often there is a misinterpretation of the behavioral cues (gestures, facial expressions, whole body adjustments) used by both the interviewer and the interviewee.  This kind of miscommunication may hinder the exchange of useful information and alienate both parties. The purpose of this Area of Interest is to develop and test indirect assessment methodologies that measure the beliefs of (i) members of a non-Western culture about the behaviors associated with truth-telling and deception within their own culture, and (ii) national security investigators about the behaviors associated with truth-telling and deception within that same non-Western culture. 

C.	Effective Interviewing and Elicitation Techniques

Techniques for collecting information from unwilling sources are necessary for a variety of government positions, ranging from the questioning of an embassy ?walk in? to the solicitation of information from a prisoner or detainee.  Personnel tasked with obtaining information from human sources must be armed with the most effective and ethical  interviewing and interrogation skills and tactics in order to gain intelligence that is reliable and valid. Unfortunately, many of the techniques currently in use often are based only on the individual experiences of the interviewers, anecdotal information, and shared beliefs, rather than on empirical behavioral and social science. Until evidence-based approaches to interviewing and elicitation are established, little progress will be made in our ability to distinguish effective from ineffective techniques.  The purpose of this Area of Interest is for the further development and validation testing one or more methods of interviewing unwilling subjects that already has been shown effective in controlled (laboratory) settings, to be assessed in multicultural field settings 

D.	Effective Training in Interviewing and Elicitation Techniques

Training programs for collecting information from unwilling sources teach an essential skill set for a variety of government positions, including operators and investigators.  There is a need to implement a standardized method of teaching and training.   The purpose of this Area of Interest is for the development and evaluation of a training course that takes advantage of what has been shown to be valid in other domains (e.g., marketing, clinical medicine, clinical psychology), such as computer-based structured interviews or training tapes that use actor-based live interviews (these are given as examples, not as requirements).

E.	Multicultural & Urban Intelligence 

Some of the most culturally and linguistically diverse communities found anywhere exist within American urban centers.  Local law enforcement agencies in these cities have developed intelligence collection methodologies and capabilities that suit such diversity and reflect the particular economic, cultural, and political institutions of both the police and the citizens they serve.  These methods have changed in response to local events (e.g., changes in NYPD, LAPD, LASD as a function of terrorist attacks and threats), which means that law enforcement agencies have experience with adapting to new environments and shifting populations.  But law enforcement policies and practices are neither conceived nor implemented in a vacuum; these occur in response to changes in the larger population and in specific groups of interest.  The relationship therefore is dynamic: responses of the ?state? and responses of the ?people? each affect each other.  The purpose of the Area of Interest is to develop and test a method to assess a local population?s reactions to its local law enforcement policies and procedures, with initial testing of the method within an urban population within the U.S., in collaboration with the local law enforcement agency or department.  

F.	Real-time Integration & Analysis Tool

Non-invasive/non-lethal behavioral assays, sensing/tracking technologies, and computing storage and analyses capabilities are growing rapidly.  These have the potential to serve as powerful adjuncts to human observer-based credibility assessment techniques.  In fact, behavioral, physiological, sensing and tracking techniques may be most powerful when they are used in a complementary manner.  However, application of these technologies to counter-intelligence requires understanding how they map onto behaviors of interest.  Such application also requires methods of determining which out of the large volumes of data collected should be saved, how data of interest can be distinguished from background ?noise,? how signals from various multimodal channels should be synthesized, and how these should be usefully analyzed.  In addition, for the results of such analyses to be useful to an operator, they need to occur in real-time.

The purpose of this area of interest is for preliminary investigation of the use of sensing and tracking technologies to complement observer-based source and asset assessments, for the development of algorithms to integrate these data on a real-time basis, and for evaluation of these technologies using traditional, observer-based methodologies.  Steps towards this goal will include (a) investigation of the usefulness of sensing, tracking and locating technologies for source and asset credibility assessment;  (b) investigation of the usefulness of the collection and analysis of digital traces for tracking and for understanding relational and social networks; (c) algorithm development for online (real-time) analyses of methods and tools for source assessments; and (c) validation of the outcomes with traditional measures of behaviors of interest.  

IV. AWARD INFORMATION 

A.	Anticipated Award Types:  It is anticipated to be in the form of a Cost Reimbursement type contract.  However the Government reserves the right to award grants, Cooperative Agreements (CAs), Other Transactions (OTs) Agreements, or interagency agreements to appropriate parties should the situation warrant.
B.	If any awards are made on any area of interest, CIFA anticipates that individual awards will be in $100,000 to $300,000 range.
C.	Anticipated Periods of Performance for New Awards: All proposals may request funding for a timeframe not to exceed 12 months. 

V. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION

This BAA is open to ALL responsible sources. Offerors may include single entities or teams from private-sector organizations, government laboratories, FFRDCs, including Department of Energy national laboratories and centers, and academic institutions.  Federally Funded Research & Development Centers (FFRDCs), are eligible to respond to this BAA, individually or as a team member of an eligible principal offeror, so long as they are permitted under a sponsoring agreement between the Government and the specific FFRDC.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU), Minority Institutions (MI), Small Business concerns, Small Disadvantaged Business concerns, Women-Owned Small Business concerns, Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns, and Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) small businesses concerns are encouraged to submit proposals. They are also encouraged to join others as team members in submitting proposals.  However, no portion of this BAA will be set-aside, pursuant to FAR Part 19.502-2.

VI. APPLICATION PROCEDURES

Vendors are invited to submit proposals for any or all areas of interest.  Each area of interest, however, must be addressed in separate electronic proposal submissions.  All proposals are to be e-mailed to Loretta.Buckley@cifa.mil in electronic MS Word format.  If the electronic version includes a signature from the appropriate representative of the offeror, hard copies will not be needed if a contract is ultimately awarded.  Electronic proposals must include separate technical and cost/price files, with separate emails for each area of interest proposed.    

The technical proposal must include:

1.	An Abstract, Background, Technical Approach, References, and Resumes of proposed researchers.
2.	Contact information such as e-mail addresses and telephone numbers to allow technical and contracting questions to be addressed;
3.	Institutional endorsement, signature of the proposed principal investigator, time frames for all phases of the project, and detailed accounts of proposed work and budget. 

The Abstract, Background, and Technical Approach sections of the proposals should be no greater than 15 pages in length per area of interest.  All pages should be single-spaced, have one-inch margins, and utilize a typeface no smaller than Times New Roman 12 font.  Proposals should be sufficiently detailed to be responsive to the criteria, described below, for evaluation.  Additional materials may include vitae, references, and institutional information.  

An evaluation team appointed by the CIFA contracting officer to include scientific peers will review the proposals according to the following dimensions in order of importance:  

1.	Importance of the research to CIFA Behavioral Science Directorate?s Mission. 
2.	Technical merit, appropriateness, and feasibility of the proposed approach. 
3.	Scientific significance and originality. 
4.	The qualifications, capabilities, and experience of the proposed principal investigator and key personnel, and institutional resources and facilities. 

   For each dimension, the proposal will be given a score grade between 1 and 5, where ?1? is highly meritorious (meets approximately 100% of the requirements), ?2? is meritorious (meets approximately 75% of the requirements), ?3? is good (meets approximately 50% of the requirements), ?4? is fair (meets approximately 25% of the requirements) and ?5? is lacking substantive merit (meets less than approximately 25% of the requirements).  Details on the scoring are as follows:

1.	Those proposals with very low importance to CIFA will be unable to recover even with high scores on the other dimensions.  
2.	A score of ?1? for dimensions 2 ? 4 would indicate that the proposal exceeds requirements and clearly demonstrates the offeror?s scientific capability to deliver exceptional performance.

All proposal submissions must contain the following sections: Abstract, Background, Technical Approach, References, and Resumes of proposed researchers.  A separate MS Word file will contain the proposed Cost or Price information.

Abstract. The abstract should be one page or less. It should describe the problem underlying the research, the methodology being developed, explain the objective of the proposal, and provide a condensed, but meaningful description of the technical approach. Authors should reference the most relevant sections of the BAA in the abstract.

Background. The background should include a description of the problem, as the proposal author understands it. It is helpful if the author shows an understanding of the CIFA contexts that apply to the proposed research. Clearly, there will not be enough space to write a critical, annotated bibliography, but the author should demonstrate meaningful knowledge of the background of the research that is being proposed.

Technical Approach. This should include a description of the behavioral or social science principles upon which the research is to be based, the goal of that research, and a detailed account of how the research is to be done. This account should be much like the methods section of a research paper. It should include a description of the data to be collected, the methods for collecting the data, the number and source of subjects and how they will be acquired, and the proposed research design and likely analysis methods. 

Reference List. This should be a list of all the references called out in the body of the proposal. It should not include publications that are not referred to in the body.  The references list must be in American Psychological Association format, APA 5th Edition.

R?sum?s. R?sum?s or vitae should be included for all proposed researchers with special emphasis on the Principal Investigator(s). It is particularly important that resumes include publications that bear on the research being proposed.   

Cost/Price Proposal.  This should be a typical budget section as is required by other federal agencies. However, it should also include a description of total dollars required overall for the government fiscal year (the government fiscal years run from October 1 through the following September 30), and the number of person hours/months broken out by personnel type (senior scientist, graduate student, research associate, clerk, etc.).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Contractor s hall provide recommendations for the best combination to reduce cost, increase efficiency, and increase effectiveness from an overall Army-wide perspective.  The Contractor will assist the Government in determining the pluses and minuses of any proposed co nsolidation, reorganization, or streamlining to include not only the examination of manpower reductions, but processes, process steps, and infrastructure that could potentially be eliminated to achieve quantitative improvements  taking into account existin g acquisitions regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), and the Army Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFARS).  The Contractor shall consider these factors, among o thers, in their updates to the Army Contracting Study:  the potential downsizing of military members of the Army Acquisition Corps;  the increasing number of civilians eligible for retirement;  the low accession rates of 1102 interns, including the difficu lty in retaining graduate interns over time.  In the analysis, the contractor shall provide the rationale for the recommendations, taking into account the observed strengths and weaknesses of each organization, both individually and as a whole.  As request ed, the contractor shall collect and assess previous studies in order to provide nput/recommendations to the working groups.

Background: The U.S. Forest Service (FS), is responsible for protecting National Forest lands from wildland fires and, by agreement with other agencies, assists in protecting other jurisdictions. The Forest Service has acquired 3 excess military aircraft for conversion to airtanker configuration. This contract is to provide an acceptable tank system and its installation for these aircraft.

Scope: This contract is for the purchase and installation of a retardant delivery system for up to 3 Forest Service owned P3B (Heavy) and P3C aircraft. Once installation and performance evaluation is complete,these aircraft would be used as large airtankers for wildland firefighting. The capacity of the retardant delivery system will be commensurate with the load carrying capacity of the aircraft. The volume of the
retardant tank shall be a minimum of 2500 gallons. The work includes design, analysis, installation and testing of the aircraft for conversion to wildland firefighting using a retardant tank. The resultant airtanker conversion shall meet the performance requirements of the Interagency Airtanker Board. Conversion of the aircraft shall occur at the contractor?s facility.

Requirements: The retardant delivery system shall be of new manufacture, externally mounted and a gravity flow design. The retardant delivery system performance shall meet the Interagency Airtanker Board tank system criteria which can be viewed at:
http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/aviation/fixed_wing/airtankers/iab_procedures/iab_procedures_sec_vii_tank_system.pdf.  The Tank installation shall be approved for use on the P3B (Heavy) and P3C airframe by the Federal Aviation Administration by Supplemental Type Certificate. The tank system shall have serviceable/maintainable life of no less than twenty (20) years.

Tank Installation: The installation of the retardant delivery system will not interfere with or cause disablement of the aircraft environmental systems to include the pressurization of the fuselage. The basic structure of the aircraft shall not be modified to the extent that it cannot be readily returned to its original configuration following removal of the tank and the bomb bay shall remain intact and operational. The installation of the
tank/retardant delivery system shall not alter the speed restrictions of an OEM, as delivered, non modified aircraft by more than ten (10) percent.

Tank Capacity:The capacity of the retardant delivery system shall remain within the Manufacturer or FAA approved normal weight limitations and center of gravity configuration for the aircraft. The approximate volume of the retardant tank should be 2500 to 3000 gallons based on a retardant weight of 9 lbs. per gallon. The
offerors specified tank quantity shall be supported by weight and balance criteria and airframe structural loads engineering analysis.

<DESC>FA2823-07-R-0026 Questions and Answers 2:

1. Question: When attaching the optical polygon, is it acceptable to attach the optical polygon to the back side of the position transducer or will you require that the optical polygon be mounted to the gimbal itself? 

Answer: We are measuring the gimbal position error at varying commanded positions.  As long as the optical polygon is attached to the gimbal to measure the gimbal position/movement we will be satisfying the position requirement of the acceptance test.  Therefore, the optical polygon should be attached to the gimbal itself.

2. Question: Should we quote systems with less accuracy as an option since the original mechanical portions of these systems were not designed to meet these specifications?

Answer: There should be no problem meeting system accuracy specs.  Therefore, you should NOT quote systems with less accuracy as an option.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.

Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern. 

(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R.

(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency. 

(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.

<DESC>This notice is to provide an update for everyone on the status of the CFT source selection.  As of Jun 29, 2007 the package is being reviewed at AFMC and SAF/AQ for approval to issue the formal RFP.  Reviews are proceeding smoothly and no major problems or concerns have arisen.  Due to the holiday next week, an exact release date for the formal RFP is difficult to predict.  The best guess right now is we "hope" to release the RFP between Jul 9 and Jul 13, 2007.  This date could slip until as late as Jul 20, 2007 if further unexpected delays are encountered though.  This anticipated release date is in NO WAY a guarantee, but is merely provided to hopefully allow for adequate planning of interested parties.

Further details will be posted as they are known.  If possible, we will post positive notice of when we will release the RFP; however due to the extremely tight timelines we're under, such notice may be the day prior to release.

All interested parties are highly encouraged to keep a close eye on FBO from this point on as once the RFP goes out, we will be on a VERY tight schedule to make award no later than 31 Jan 08.

Thank you for you continued interest in the CFT contracts.

<DESC>Additional Information (29 Jun 07): T-38C Improved Braking System Program (IBSP) Drawings Available Upon  Request The drawings referenced in section two of the wheel and brake notional  system/testing baseline for the T-38C IBSP are now available.  To request  a copy, please email Karen Shelley at Karen.Shelley@wpafb.af.mil. Addition Information (29 Jun 07): The attached questions and answers were taken from Panel Discussions at  T-38C IBSP Industry Days on 12 Jun 07. Addition Information: The attached performance specifications were developed during a two year  risk reduction activity.  These performance specifications define key  envelope information, desired system performance and testing requirements.  The attached specifications are provided as a baseline reference to aid in  the development and qualification of your proposed design.  In the  interest of best value, potential offerors are encouraged to review and  propose any improvements and/or modifications to the performance  specifications. 1.  The intent of this Request For Information (RFI) is to develop a  better understanding of technologies available and resources required to  incorporate an improved braking system on the T-38C aircraft.  The overall requirement  for the T-38 Improved Brake System Program (IBSP) is to upgrade USAF Air Education  Training Command's fleet of 453 T-38C and 3 AFMC T-38C aircraft.  Although not  finalized, it is possible that this requirement will be expanded to include both the US  Navy Test Pilot Schools 10 T-38C aircraft and the 31 T-38N aircraft operated by  NASA. The upgraded system shall include the addition of anti-skid capability;  replacement of the current wheel, brake, master cylinders, and other system components  (as necessary); appropriate updates to all aircraft training devices and  technical manuals; necessary on and off aircraft test equipment, any  required studies and analyses and all associated integration issues; and interim contractor  support until fielding is complete.  The IBSP is intended to improve performance, reliability, maintainability and aircraft safety.  More specifically, the modification shall: - Increase braking performance enabling a 13,500 pound aircraft to  accelerate to take off speed with 60% flaps and subsequently stop safely on the  remaining space of an 8000 foot runway (45 degrees C, 1500' pressure  altitude) - Prevent wheel skid, and or lockup; keep wheel speed below tread adhesion  limit; provide protection from hydroplaning. - Prevent wheel brakes from being applied until wheels are up to speed - Provide fault detection and cockpit annunciation - Shall not add main landing gear vibrations during takeoff, landing or  ground operations. - Shall not cause loss of all braking if brake control fails. - Extend brake service life to at least 450 flight hours (current service  life is less than 200) - Not reduce current Mission Capable rates of aircraft - Not increase Maintenance Man Hours (MMH) per flying hour more than 1% - Not increase tire change time over 5 additional minutes 2. The IBSP acquisition approach is anticipated to be a competitive  solicitation with the intent of utilizing a non-development approach to the greatest  extent possible.  The selected contractor will assume all responsibility for  development, testing and integration of the proposed system. The anticipated  acquisition may include up to two years of development and a six-year ordering period with  variable quantity bands and a most probable quantity".  The Government currently anticipates a production and installation rate of six (6) to seven (7)  shipsets per month (72 - 84 per year). The quantity bands will need to be structured  with suitable flexibility to accelerate or decelerate the rate of production to accommodate fluctuations in funding.  It is anticipated that IBSP  modification kits will be installed by contractor field teams. 3.  This RFI is issued for information and planning purposes only and does  not constitute a solicitation.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(e), a response to this notice is not an offer  and cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractors facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractors Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractors Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractors Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractors  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

<CONTACT>Charlotte Puthoff, 937-257-6636 x4094
<DESC>Department of the Air Force, AFSAC  Air Force Security Assistance Center,  1822 Van Patton Drive, Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh 45433-5337 The Air Force  Security Assistance Center (AFSAC) is issuing the attached Request for  Proposal (RFP) to provide Emergency Airfield Lighting (EALS) for nine (9)  air bases, twenty-one (21) EALS Transport Vehicles, Program Management,  and any associated training for the Taiwan Air Force (TAF). A Statement of Objective (SOO) is attachment 1 to the RFP.  The contractor  is required to prepare the Statement of Work, based on the SOO, for this  effort. The anticipated contract will be firm-fixed price and the period of  performance will be for two (2) years starting approximately 28 Sep 2007.  Any questions regarding this solicitation should be directed to Charlotte  A. Puthoff, Contract Negotiator, AFSAC/PKT, Wright-Patterson AFB Ohio via  email: charlotte.puthoff@wpafb.af.mil. Charlotte A. Puthoff, Contract  Negotiator, Phone 937-257-7298, ext. 4094. Email:  charlotte.puthoff@wpafb.af.mil Questions & Answers Submitted: Q:  -- SOO, paragraph 4, states training shall occur at each of the 9  bases, but Field Service is only allowing for 3.5 weeks for training and  PMRs.  The last contract which provided complete training for Taiwan EALS  was scheduled as 1 week per base (1 day preparation, 2.5 days classroom, 1  day field, .5 day student testing).  The Field Service timing identified  would only allow for training at 3 bases, not all 9, for the same level of  training provided previously.  Is this correct then, that training will  only occur at 3 bases?  Please clarify. A:  The plan is to do 3 bases as stated below.  This will be 1 week at  each base including training ( 1day preparation, 2.5 days classroom, 1 day  field  1/2 day student testing).  At the end of the 3 weeks training, a  Program management meeting will be held.  This will be approximately 2  days.    Return to the US until the next 3 sets of equipment are ready for  the next 3 bases which as stated in the RFP is approximately 6 weeks  later.  Go back to Taiwan and do the next 3 bases when the equipment is in  Taiwan.  Return to the US for approximately 6 weeks later until the next 3  sets of equipment are in Taiwan.   This is a 3 part plan.  There will be 3  trips to Taiwan consisting of 3/12 weeks each trip.  Q:    -- Evaluation Factors, Sub Factor 2:  the export license process  requires a valid contract, therefore, it is not possible to provide  documentation verifying that the export license already exists prior to  contract award.   Based on past experience, an export license was obtained  for the required items, after contract award.  Is it acceptable to provide  the past export license for these items as a reference?  Please clarify A: The contractor must demonstrate that they can obtain an export license  in a timely manner to meet the delivery requirements of the contract.

<DESC>The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), Regulatory Support Affairs contract will provide regulatory expertise, technical, and administrative support for DMID's clinical research programs.<br>
</br>
Research supported and conducted by the NIAID, NIH, DHHS, strives to understand, treat and ultimately prevent the myriad of infectious, immunologic, and allergic diseases that threaten millions of human lives. The NIAID, DMID supports extramural research to control and prevent diseases caused by virtually all infectious agents other than Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This includes basic and applied research to develop and evaluate therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostics, which is funded through a variety of research grants and contracts.<br> 
</br>
Developing and testing new vaccines and therapies have historically been a major focus of the research supported by the DMID.  Much of this research is devoted to addressing critical public health needs, such as those related to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (e.g., avian influenza and West Nile Virus), as well as those supporting the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates against potential agents of bioterrorism, including NIAID priority biodefense pathogens (http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/Biodefense/bandc_priority.htm).<br>   
</br>
In order to ensure that the development, testing and manufacture of products evaluated under DMID-supported clinical research are executed with a rigor that will support licensure by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), DMID supports an infrastructure to provide regulatory assistance in the development and testing of these products.<br>  
</br>
Currently, DMID sponsors approximately 100 Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) or Master Files (MFs) which span more than 200 clinical trials.  This includes both multicenter trials and single center studies, and encompasses Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials performed at both domestic and foreign sites.  DMID files approximately 10-20 new INDs each year, and in this capacity, serves as the official IND sponsor and liaison with the FDA with respect to all regulatory requirements.  Currently, the DMID IND portfolio is comprised of approximately 75% vaccine and other biologic INDs (monoclonal), 20% drug INDs, and 5% MFs.  In addition, it is anticipated that Investigational Device Exemptions (IDEs) will be required during the contract period of performance.<br>
 </br>
It is anticipated that one cost reimbursement, completion type contract will be awarded for a seven-year period of performance beginning on or about 
April 1, 2008.<br>  
</br>
Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about May 22, 2007 and may be accessed through the NIAID Office of Acquisitions (OA) Home Page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract and on FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (ETA)is modifying the Sources Sought Notice 49-071A-473, posted on February 12, 2007. ETA releases this modification for the purpose of determining if any firms are capable of licensing the name and methodology of a customer satisfaction survey. Interested firms who read this modified notice and believe they have the requisite capabilities must respond by July 16, 2007. The U.S. Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration (DOL/ETA), is seeking the assistance of an organization capable of licensing a customer satisfaction survey name and methodology to DOL/ETA for use during Program Year 2007 (July 1, 2007 to June 30, 2008) in meeting Workforce Investment Act (WIA) customer satisfaction requirements. The WIA (Section 136(B)(2)(B)) requires states to measure customer satisfaction of employers and participants with WIA services received from statewide and local workforce investment systems. The legislation also provides that there be state-adjusted levels of performance that are expressed in an objective, quantifiable, and measurable form, show the progress of the state toward continuously improving in performance, and are comparable across states. Accordingly, DOL/ETA requires that states use a standard measurement tool so it can compare the customer satisfaction scores reported by states. All surveys and calculations of results are conducted by states, not by DOL/ETA and not by the contractor supplying the license. The methodology to be licensed will include survey questions and a response scale (with quality standards for their use), for both participants and employers that receive WIA services. Additionally, weights that can be used to transform the mean response values into scores will be required for each state. The weights minimize random survey variation or measurement error arising from differences in the characteristics of the state's customer groups. The contractor must be able to offer licenses for purchase by individual states if they choose to measure satisfaction at the local level in lieu of a statewide survey. The contractor must have ready or must develop the survey methodology in time for states to use during PY 2007 (the period ending June 30, 2008). Any development costs should be included in the cost estimate. Additional activities to be funded under this contract are: (1) the preparation of materials necessary for DOL/ETA to submit an Information Collection Request to the Office of Management and Budget as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act, and (2) training for states through web conferencing, multi-media presentations, published training materials, and other mechanisms to be proposed by the contractor; (3) ongoing Help Desk assistance to states in the form of answering questions regarding the survey methodology and its use. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS (RFP) AND IS NOT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO ISSUE A SOLICITATION OR ULTIMALEY TO AWARD A CONATRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE. Responses to this sources sought notice will not serve as proposals, bids or offers, which could be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. Submission of any information in responses to this sources sought notice is completely voluntary, and shall not constitute a fee to the government. The main purpose of this sources sought notice is to conduct market research and determine the organizations capable for future competition. The Department of Labor, Employment & Training Administration invites all interested parties to submit a written response to this sources sought notice. Qualified sources interested are invited to submit a Statement of Capability (SOC), not to exceed ten (10) pages in length, by July 16, 2007. The firms must provide supporting evidence in the SOC that they have the capability to perform the requested services and must submit cost and price information in response to the requested services. Interested firms should use their best business judgment in determining the level of effort for the requested services. Interested firms must also provide a Gantt chart that illustrates the work schedule by months. The chart should show the starting date and ending date of each activity. No solicitation document exists. Responses to this notice must be in writing. No telephone inquiries will be accepted. Responses must include the SOC and reference the notice number 49-071A-473, and DOL contact, Ms. DaVeana Johnson, Contract Specialist, 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W., Room N-4655, Washington, D.C. 20210. No award will be based on any offer or proposal received in response to this notice.

FAR 52.215-3 REQUEST FOR INFORMATION OR SOLICITATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES (OCT 1997)  (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although &quot;proposal&quot; and &quot;offer&quot; are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal.  (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of: Business Rules Engine (BRE) and Business Rules Management System (BRMS) solutions.    (End of provision)  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is conducting market research for businesses that provide decision assistance tools, such as BREs, BRMS, evidence organizing tools, etc.  The objective is to increase accuracy, productivity, and consistency in claims processing.  The business process for adjudicating VA claims is derived from VA statute (Title 38 United States Code), VA regulations (Title 38 Code of Federal Regulations), and business line promulgated procedures.  VA is researching the use of computer- assisted decision support to enhance VBA claims processing efficiency.  The tools must be compatible with web-based Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).   VBA has five business lines that adjudicate claims submitted by veterans and eligible dependents seeking entitlement to various VA benefits.  VA anticipates that implementation will occur in incremental phases via a web-based SOA to 57 regional offices and pension maintenance centers (PMCs).  The VBA five business lines within these regional offices and PMCs are:  1.	Compensation and Pension (C&amp;P) (approximately 10,000 users) (http://www.vba.va.gov/bln/21/index.htm); 2.	Education (approximately 1,000 users) (http://www.gibill.va.gov/); 3.	Loan Guaranty (approximately 1,000 users) (http://www.homeloans.va.gov/);  4.

Interested parties shall submit a capability statement for a decision support solution, company name, point of contact, address, DUNS number, and a brief company background.  It is requested that sufficient information be provided to allow evaluation of the proposed solution to support the Government in execution of its mission for benefits delivery as currently codified in law and regulation.  Please include a list-pricing model based on the information provided herein, for a minimum of 500 users.  Include the cost of maintenance, and a list of available resellers, if applicable.  If the company has any current Government contracts (i.e. GSA, DOD, NASA SEWP, etc.), please list them as well.  In addition, please provide responses to the following questions: 1.  How does the solution capture claims processing rules and procedures from an existing system? 2.  How are business rules and procedures changed, modified, and administered with the solution?  Does maintenance require a software developer, or other administrator? Please explain. Can a business analyst administer the solution? 3.  Is the performance of the solution scalable for high volume online use?  For example, approximately 10,000 users located at 57 different regional offices and PMCs in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines.   4.	How does the solution interface with other technologies?  Specifically the solution will need to interface with VBA systems that support the delivery of benefits for the five VBA business lines.  Can the solution include scripting and changes to code in order to interface with VBA systems? 5. How does your solution support users with differing skill sets and with differing needs, e.g., (1) claims processing professionals; (2) veterans attempting self-service; and (3) call center operations?  6. What advanced inference features does the solution provide? 7. Describe proposed solution repository and how it works to improve claims processing. 8. Can the company provide a turnkey solution (from analysis to implementation)? For BREs, please respond to 9, 10 and 11: 9.  Is there support for:	 - 	Recursive rules? -	Object and rule inheritance support?  (Firing one rule allows a family of related rules to fire.) - 	Multiple inference engine support?  (Internal / external.) - 	Other?   10.  What rule management features does your BRE have? 	-  Rule extensibility? 	-  Rule change administration and impact analysis? 	-  Rule versioning for firing rules for specific date ranges, in the past and future? 	-  Rule release versioning? 	-  Rule security? 	-  Audit report capability? 10.  What &quot;out-of-the-box&quot; rules packaging does the BRE have?

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce/National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration/NESDIS, intends to negotiate with the Texas A & M University System , College Station TX. On a sole source basis, under the authority of 41 U. S.C. 253 ( c ) ( 1 ) , only one responsible source. It is believed that only this entity can satisfy the agency requirement to provide scientific and technical expertise services for the Enhancement of the Capabilities of Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation (JCSDA) for Simulating Radiative Transfer in Ice-cloudy Atmospheres. This task will provide science supports to JCSDA  in radiative transfer modeling by integrating the optical properties of ice crystals, computed from advanced light scattering models, into the CRTM. The primary objective is to improve the accuracy of the CRTM for simulating radiative transfer in an ice-cloudy atmosphere. The Texas A & M University (TAMU) have developed state-of-the-art light scattering models for computing the single-scattering properties of nonspherical ice crystals. The TAMU team shall develop the optical properties (phase function, single-scattering albedo, and extinction efficiency) of ice crystals for specific applications to CRTM in terms of wavelengths and data format. The  TAMU team will truncate the phase function and adjust other relevant optical properties for application to CRTM in the case of ice-cloudy atmospheres. The CRTM can account for the real atmospheric temperature and water vapor, and the vertical distribution of the cloud and aerosol. CRTM will be of great utility to the research community, This will be divided in to 2 ( TWO) . Stage 1 Task 1. At the solar and IR wavelengths involved in CRTM, compute the phase functions, single-scattering albedo, and extinction efficiency of individual hexagonal ice columns. Task 2, Average the single-scattering properties (i.e., the phase functions, single-scattering albedo, and extinction efficiency) obtained in Task 1 for various size distributions. For each size distribution, the effective particle size will be computed. The bulk optical properties of ice clouds will be specified as functions of the effective particle size. Task 3. Truncate the delta-transmission and diffraction peak in the phase function in terms of Legendre polynomials: and scale the relevant extinction coefficient and single-scattering albedo on the basis of the similarity principle. Task 4. Document data sets and computational algorithms, and facilitate integration of the resulting optical properties of ice clouds into the CRTM.  Stage 2 Task 5 with the experience gained in stage one, repeat Tasks 1-4 for a mixture of various ice crystal habits. Task 6, After the delivered data set are tested within the CRTM frame, improve/refine/finalize the delivered data sets. 

This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K) NAIC code 611310. Interested persons may identify their interest and must demonstrate their capability in order to be considered for this opportunity. This is not a request for Competitive proposal No competitive solicitation is planned, information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not to open up for competitive procedures.

<DESC>The National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD) Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases (CCID), Influenza Division (ID), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supports a World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza, to present to the FDA and the vaccine manufacturers twice yearly the seed viruses that are to be used in the production of influenza vaccine for the Northern Hemisphere and the Sothern Hemisphere.  The FDA requires that the viruses be grown exclusively in eggs, because tissue culture may contain latent viruses that might be detrimental to the vaccinees. The Influenza Division also has the responsibility of producing 500 WHO Influenza Reagent Kits for the identification of influenza isolates.  Each year the Influenza Division will also produce supplemental non human influenza reagent kits.  Lastly, eggs are also used throughout the year for research purposes.   The three activities noted above result in the usage of between 14,000 and 17,000 dozen eggs per year.

The CDC is searching for Contractors who can furnish 14,000 to 17,000 dozen white embryonated 10 day old chicken eggs per year that will be used singularly and in conjunction with various tissue culture systems for the isolation of influenza viruses.  The contractor shall  guarantee that a minimum of 95 percent of the white fertile chicken eggs be viable at delivery.  If possible, all white fertile chicken eggs furnished shall be from a single flock, and all flocks from which eggs are furnished shall meet the requirements of the National Poultry Improvement Plan of 1963, after testing by an official of the appropriate State Agency and shall qualify for the rating, "U.S. Pullorum-Typhoid Clean".  Eggs shall be free of bacterial, fungal or mycoplasmal contamination.  Eggs shall weigh a minimum of 23-25 ounces per dozen and shall not be washed, dipped, fumigated, buffed, or cleaned in any manner but shall be smooth, free from blemishes, cracks, fecal material and pencil or other markings.  If you can provide white fertile chicken eggs as described herein, please contact the contract specialist with your firm name; address; voice and email contact information; alternate NAICS Code, if applicable; and business size.  If a small business, identify specific classification and basis for business size determination, annual revenue or number of employees.

DSCA, formerly known as the Defense Security Assistance Agency (DSAA), is a joint Defense Agency under the purview of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy.  DSCA manages a family of activities collectively known as Security Cooperation (or Security Assistance) programs.  Among these, the largest is Foreign Military Sales (FMS) where the U.S. Government sells or leases weapons, ammunition, spares, training, and other defense-related services to over 150 countries and special organizations (e.g., NATO) on a government-to-government basis.  These sales and leases are formalized in contract-like documents known as Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOA).  In addition to selling military training via FMS, DSCA also manages the provision of foreign military training under other programs that receive U.S. appropriated funding.  These include International Military Education and Training (IMET), the Counter-Terrorism Fellowship Program (CTFP), and the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) program.  While DSCA manages these programs in support of the U.S. Departments of Defense and State, the MILDEPs perform most of the detailed work and are the main users of DSAMS.

The DSAMS Program  

DSAA, now known as DSCA, initiated the DSAMS program in 1995.  Its objective was to replace numerous duplicative legacy information systems supporting the Security Assistance mission with a single modern information system and to enforce Security Assistance standard business processes (to the extent possible) across the three MILDEPs.  The program was planned to proceed incrementally in four modules, with each successive module adding functionality to a single DSAMS system and eliminating the need to use the legacy systems for that purpose:

1.	The Case Development Module (CDM) would support the development of Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOAs) for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) cases.
2.	The Case Implementation Module (CIM) would support the initial funding of FMS cases
3.	The Training Module (TM) would support the management and execution of international military training
4.	The Case Execution Module (CEM) would support the execution of logistics and acquisition support, as well as case closure.

The team that developed and maintained DSAMS consisted of a contractor and DSADC.  DSADC was formed in 1997 by transferring 100 personnel responsible for maintaining some of the MILDEP legacy systems from the Army, Navy and Air Force to DSCA (then DSAA).  DSADC is a field component of DSCA under primary program direction from DSCA?s DSAMS Program Management Office (PMO) within the Information Technology Directorate.  In addition to having DSAMS responsibilities, DSADC personnel continue to maintain the Army and Navy legacy systems that they originally developed when part of the Army and Navy.  

The DSAMS program succeeded in deploying the CDM incrementally in 1998-1999 and CIM in August 2000 to all the MILDEPs and relevant Defense Agencies.  In October 2000, the new DSCA Director issued a decision memorandum to (1) continue the TM to completion and (2) cancel the CEM.  

Although the TM was originally designed to be deployed simultaneously to the Army, Navy, and Air Force (to support cross-Service training as well as standard operations for overseas U.S. Security Assistance Offices (SAOs)), large Air Force requirements changes in the financial functionality area ultimately led to a September 2005 decision by the DSCA Director to initially deploy only to the Army and Navy, with deployment to the Air Force occurring at the earliest realistic opportunity following a successful Army/Navy deployment and appropriate stability thereafter.   Going from a tri-Service deployment scenario to a two-Service deployment scenario (with Air Force remaining on its legacy system) required building what is known as the ?Black Box?, and the Black Box logic will have to be removed once deployment to the Air Force is accomplished.  The TM was successfully deployed to the Army and Navy in October 2006 and is expected to still be undergoing above-average maintenance at the inception of this contract in approximately September 2007.  

The TM consists of two broad areas of functionality: Operations/Pricing and Financial functionality.  For the Air Force, Operations/Pricing functionality has largely been completed, but the Financial functionality is not yet complete.  An intensive Air Force financial requirements review effort had been completed in May 2005, and reconstruction of this new financial functionality against those requirements was suspended on 16 September 2005 when the decision was made to initially deploy only to the Army and Navy.  All code completed to that point in time was integrated into the code base, and further analysis, design, coding, and testing after that point continued only to the extent that the targeted Army and Navy deployment was not adversely impacted.  The successful contractor will need to assess the partially completed work, complete the development and initial system testing, and allow for sufficient rounds of user testing with converted data to enable it to be safely deployed at the earliest opportunity.  As the system is best deployed at the beginning of a fiscal year following prior close-out actions for the previous fiscal year, the earliest opportunity is currently late October 2008 (and thus late October 2009 is the next earliest opportunity).  

Training Module Functionality

Functionality in the TM is broadly subdivided into two major areas, each with two sub-areas:

a.	Operations & Pricing Area
-	The Operations sub-area involves maintaining lists of courses, creating notional series of courses (called tracks) for future foreign military students, obtaining quotas for courses from DoD schools, assigning students to courses, planning travel and living allowances (TLA) for the students and their dependents, and monitoring and reporting student progress.
-	The Pricing sub-area involves establishing costs for various sub-components of every course.  Multiple prices are involved for each component, depending on the nature of the funding, the country?s economic situation, and the nature of the country?s relationship with the U.S. Government.
b.	Financials Area
-	The Pre-Performance sub-area deals with planning and obligating funding for courses.  It establishes obligations in the MILDEPs? accounting systems.
-	The Post-Performance sub-area deals with billing and reimbursements.  It liquidates the obligations created in the Pre-Performance sub-area.  It also provides data to the MILDEPs? accounting systems.

Another major TM function is to interact with overseas U.S. Security Assistance Officers (SAOs) who vet, test for English proficiency, and collect information (e.g., name, rank, unit, and passport number) on foreign students needed to produce the Invitational Travel Order (ITO).  The SAOs do this using a client-based application called the Training Management System (TMS) that, effective with DSAMS TM deployment to Army/Navy in October 2006, communicates with DSAMS via an intermediate server known as the Security Assistance Network (SAN) server.  When the TM is deployed to the Air Force, a single two-way interface between DSAMS and the SAN for all MILDEPs will exist.  Until that happens, the ?Black Box? logic will be employed to take into account that the Air Force remains on its legacy system.  The Black Box allows the complex interaction among DSAMS, SAN and TMS to occur while only two MILDEPs are in DSAMS and one remains in its legacy environment.  Some partial benefits are achieved for the Air Force, and SAOs interacting with Air Force, as a result of TM being deployed to Army/Navy and the associated moves to DSAMS-enhanced versions of SAN and TMS. The full benefits will be realized once Air Force is brought into TM.

Accounting System Interfaces

The TM was designed to replace the individual legacy Army, Navy and Air Force systems used to manage foreign military training, and to continue to interface with the legacy accounting systems used by those Services.  For the Army and Navy, those accounting systems are the standard legacy systems long used throughout the Army and Navy, the Standard Army Financial System (STANFINS) and the Standard Accounting and Reporting System (STARS) respectively.  For the Air Force, the command responsible for foreign military training (Air Force Security Assistance Training squadron (AFSAT)) has long used an accounting system, the Training Control System (TRACS) Financial System (TFS) unique to the Air Force?s foreign military training program.  DSAMS was originally planned to interface with TFS.  

In March 2002, the Air Force decided to move the accounting for foreign military training from TFS to the Air Force?s standard legacy General Accounting and Finance System (GAFS) in concert with the replacement of the Air Force?s foreign military training execution system by DSAMS TM.  The Air Force made this decision because it would meet Air Force strategic automation goals and objectives in the longer term, acknowledging the adverse impact to the DSAMS cost and schedule in the shorter term.  DSCA concurred with this decision.   However, in the continuation of DSAMS?s development to completion, significant changes to the Air Force financial requirements and the interaction with GAFS forced the September 2005 decision to initially deploy to just the Army and Navy, with deployment to the Air Force occurring later at the earliest opportunity.  

Case Development Module and Case Implementation Module Functionality

The CDM functionality in DSAMS is used by the MILDEPs and Defense Agencies to create Letters of Offer and Acceptance (LOAs).   This is not a simple word processing function, but rather a complex data-driven process that includes pricing, enforcing diplomacy-based business rules such as sanctions, creation of payment schedules, enforcement of workflow rules, maintenance of timeline metrics, maintenance of lists of permissible military articles and services (MASLs), and document preparation.  

The CIM functionality in DSAMS includes receiving notification from the DFAS Defense Integrated Financial System (DIFS) that customer funds have been received and conveying LOA data and funding status to the legacy case execution systems of the MILDEPs.

The principal objectives are to acquire software development and maintenance services necessary to: 

a.	Modify portions of the software functionality in response to critical requirements changes or software defects discovered in production after TM was deployed to the Army and Navy in October 2006, as well as requirements deferred for initial deployment but needed as soon as possible following deployment; 
b.	Design, build, modify and test portions of the functionality needed to ultimately allow the TM to be deployed to the Air Force at the earliest opportunity; 
c.	Provide a portion of the defect reduction and enhancements after TM deployment to the Air Force;  
d.	Provide certain associated support (e.g., data conversion, reports development, user test support, database administration, release/configuration management, interface development) to the TM development and production maintenance effort; and
e.	Provide portions of general maintenance and enhancement support to all aspects of DSAMS as needed.

<CONTACT>Barry Sayer, 301-619-1163
<DESC>SUBJECT The TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) is conducting market research to determine current functionality of systems offering a commercially available automated telephone and Internet solution for pharmacy refill request processing, processing refill requests  while the electronic information medical system (currently Composite Health Care System (CHCS)) is unavailable, processing appointment reminders, and reminder calls to beneficiaries who fail to pick up prescription refills based on business rules provided  by the Government.  Our intent is to maintain and if possible enhance capabilities within the Military Health System (MHS) direct care system.   Responses are due to this RFI by 4:00 PM on 13 July 2007.   DISCLAIMER This Request for Information (RFI) is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  Neither unsolicited proposals nor any other kinds of offers will be considered in response to this RFI.  Responses to th is notice are not offers and will not be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.  All information received in response to this RFI that is marked Pro prietary will be handled accordingly.  Responses to the RFI will not be returned. At this time, questions concerning the composition and requirements for a future RFP, as well as those regarding the nature of the products reviewed for this Automated Pharmacy Refill Request and Appointment Reminder System initiative will not be entertain ed. DESCRIPTION TRICARE is the US Department of Defense (DoD) health care plan using military health care as the main delivery system.  This system is augmented by a civilian network of providers and facilities serving uniformed service members, their families, retired mi litary, and their families worldwide.  TMA is the DoD organization responsible for managing the TRICARE health care benefit.  This includes managing the integration of state of the art technologies to enhance patient safety, efficiency, and cost effectiven ess. The Automated Pharmacy Refill Request and Appointment Reminder System, at this time, provides common framework for Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) to remind patients of scheduled appointments, and allow patients the ablility to request refills via the telephone and internet.  Presently, 121 MTFs currently have the Automated Pharmacy Refill Request and Appointment Reminder System deployed.  Current functionalities within the MHS includes:  Prescription refills via telephone  Prescription refills via the internet Offline processing of phone-in prescription refill requests when the electronic information medical system is unavailable (e.g. network downtime) Appointment reminders via telephone Prescription pick-up reminders via telephone  Automated messages (surveys, health messages, and drug recalls) New prescription and walk-up refill processing for times when electronic information medical system is unavailable (e.g. network downtime)   .    TMA is seeking information from industry that will assist in the future deployment of an Automated Pharmacy Refill Request and Appointment Reminder System that will support the MHS.   Responses should also include information regarding any current or similar DoD contracts and/or relevant past DoD project experience. REQUIREMENTS  This section enumerates the functional requirements for an Automated Pharmacy Refill Request and Appointment Reminder System.   Functional: Please provide information on how the following capabilities are enabled via the telephone and internet: Automated Medication Refill System Automated processing of prescription refill requests Renewal requests  Patient may automatically generate a renewal request which is sent directly to the corresponding physician Surveys and ability to automate drug recalls The patient is prompte d with specific questions in reference to medication.  Responses can then be recorded and reports generated.  The prompts may include: satisfaction surveys, disease management, and medication recalls Staff recall application  In the event of a situation necessitating the notification of staff members, the recall application will ensure that the healthcare facility is able to notify all personnel with the same message in a timely manner. Patient Appointment Reminder Services Automatically pull the appropriate data off the host system, and then sort through the data for any exclusions Allow customized messaging using vendor provided professional voice recordings with local override available as needed Allow beneficiaries to confirm or cancel their appointments through the reminder call Clinics have the capability to inform the patient of an appointment cancellation System: Please provide information on the following capabilities: Interfacing/integrating with: Existing electronic information medical systems  Pharmacy management systems  Patient web portals  Processing new prescriptions and walk-up refill for times when the electronic information medical system is unavailable (e.g. network downtime) Utilizing commercial messaging (e.g., HL7) The purpose of this RFI is to gather information about those requirements enumerated above.  To the extent simplifying assumptions are needed, respondents are encouraged to make and document such assumptions in their responses. This RFI seeks information about approaches that could meet the functional requirements.  In doing so, the Government seeks to understand the tradeoffs among risks, costs (initial and ongoing) and alternative technical architectures that incorporate increa sing degrees of sharing.   The Government is open to alternative concepts for solutions that meet these requirements including an overview of new technologies or approaches to providing the requested or similar functionality.  The Government encourages creativity and outside the box  thinking in responses to this RFI. CONTACT INFORMATION Following is the Point of Contact (POC) for this RFI: Henry Gibbs 5111 Leesburg Pike, Suite 810 Falls Church, VA 22041 Phone: (703) 681-2890 E-Mail: Henry.Gibbs@tma.osd.mil  Please submit responses via e-mail in Microsoft Office 2000 (at a minimum) format by 4:00 PM on July 13, 2007, to the POC above.

<SUBJECT>99 -- P3 Tanking
<DESC>FedBiz Interest Announcement for P3 Tanking

Background: The U.S. Forest Service (FS), is responsible for protecting National Forest lands from wildland fires and, by agreement with other agencies, assists in protecting other jurisdictions. The Forest Service has acquired 3 excess military aircraft for conversion to airtanker configuration. This contract is to provide an acceptable tank system and its installation for these aircraft.

Scope: This contract is for the purchase and installation of a retardant delivery system for up to 3 Forest Service owned P3B (Heavy) and P3C aircraft. Once installation and performance evaluation is complete,these aircraft would be used as large airtankers for wildland firefighting. The capacity of the retardant delivery system will be commensurate with the load carrying capacity of the aircraft. The volume of the
retardant tank shall be a minimum of 2500 gallons. The work includes design, analysis, installation and testing of the aircraft for conversion to wildland firefighting using a retardant tank. The resultant airtanker conversion shall meet the performance requirements of the Interagency Airtanker Board. Conversion of the aircraft shall occur at the contractor?s facility.

Requirements: The retardant delivery system shall be of new manufacture, externally mounted and a gravity flow design. The retardant delivery system performance shall meet the Interagency Airtanker Board tank system criteria which can be viewed at:
http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/aviation/fixed_wing/airtankers/iab_procedures/iab_procedures_sec_vii_tank_system.pdf.  The Tank installation shall be approved for use on the P3B (Heavy) and P3C airframe by the Federal Aviation Administration by Supplemental Type Certificate. The tank system shall have serviceable/maintainable life of no less than twenty (20) years.

Tank Installation: The installation of the retardant delivery system will not interfere with or cause disablement of the aircraft environmental systems to include the pressurization of the fuselage. The basic structure of the aircraft shall not be modified to the extent that it cannot be readily returned to its original configuration following removal of the tank and the bomb bay shall remain intact and operational. The installation of the
tank/retardant delivery system shall not alter the speed restrictions of an OEM, as delivered, non modified aircraft by more than ten (10) percent.

Tank Capacity:The capacity of the retardant delivery system shall remain within the Manufacturer or FAA approved normal weight limitations and center of gravity configuration for the aircraft. The approximate volume of the retardant tank should be 2500 to 3000 gallons based on a retardant weight of 9 lbs. per gallon. The
offerors specified tank quantity shall be supported by weight and balance criteria and airframe structural loads engineering analysis.

If not, in what areas?  Are the lines of demarcation, in terms of ticket handling, between Tier 0/1 and Tier 2 and Tier 3 clear?
2.	TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP:  The Government's goal is to optimize the handling of customer tickets such that tickets of varying complexity are addressed by the support channel (e.g., Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) best equipped and staffed to address the specific issue towards the goal of overall reduction of Total Cost to the Forest Service.  Does the distribution of ticket volume indicated in these documents maximally achieve that goal?  If not, how could the approach be improved? 
3.	RISK: Which requirements create the greatest risk to the CCC Contractor, why, and what mitigation is proposed?
4.	RADIO AND TELEPHONE SUPPORT:  What is the impact (positive and/or negative) of the inclusion of Radio and Telephone support in CCC Tier 0/1 support?
5.	REQUIREMENTS DEFINITION:  Where are the Government's requirements articulated in an overly restrictive or prescriptive form such that the Offeror's proposal is constrained in a manner damaging to the Government?
6.	INSTRUCTIONS TO OFFERORS:  Are the Instructions to Offerors (Section L) clear?  Is the format of the Offeror's required response well-defined?  Are there Proposal elements that should be required that would allow the Offeror to better describe their solution?
7.	SCOPE:  The scope of the BPA is intentionally defined very broadly.  Where does this broad definition of scope pose the greatest cost and/or performance risk?
8.	TECHNOLOGY:  Are the technology/tool requirements overly prescriptive?  Do these requirements limit the Offeror's technical solution in a manner that negatively impacts the Forest Service?  Which technology/tool requirements (ACD, IVR, KMS, SAS, TMS, SGTS, etc.) are increasing cost in a manner disproportionate to the benefits?
9.	PERFORMANCE BASIS: Is the performance basis well described and optimal for aligning Forest Service and CCC Contractor incentives?  What are your suggestions to improve the award fee plan, while still putting some amount of revenue at risk?  Is the use of "swappable" SLAs and SLOs optimal?  Is there a better approach?
10.	PRICING: Does the approach of pricing Firm Fixed Price by Band optimally align Government and Contractor incentives and goals?
11.	SOFTWARE SUPPORT: What are the pros and cons of the Government's use of two categories to delineate primary responsibility for software support?
12.	MAC SUPPORT: What are the cost and complexity implications of including Macintosh computer support in scope?
13.	ASSUMPTIONS:  What are the particular areas of ambiguity or risk that are of greatest concern to your organization?  Please describe how these areas could be addressed to reduce the number of assumptions your company is forced to make and reduce the risk profile of this requirement from your company's perspective.
14.	COST DRIVERS: What requirements are driving costs in addition to actual contact volume?  Please identify these drivers and how the Forest Service can best address these issues with the goal of reducing overall costs and maintaining a predictable year over year service cost.
15.	INFORMATION GAPS:  Has the RFQ provided your company with enough detail (i.e., call volumes, etc.) for your company to produce a cost competitive bid?  If not please indicate what additional information your company would like to have in order to make the most competitive bid possible.
16.	TRANSITION GAPS:  What additional information would your company need in order to facilitate a smooth and successful Transition?
17.	FIRST CALL RESOLUTION:  Given that a stated goal of this solicitation is to increase the rate of first call resolution are there any requirements that would impede your organization?s ability to deliver high levels of first call resolution?
18.	TRANSITION TIMELINE:  Is ninety (90) days adequate for Transition and what are the associated risks with such a timeline?
19.	SOFTWARE SUPPORT:  Today's GOTS software is supported through a combination of the centralized EUSC helpdesk, Tier 2 ISO support, and individual help desks operated by GOTS application owners.  It is the Government's intent to migrate applications currently supported by individual help desks operated by GOTS application owners to the centralized CCC.  What are the implications of this migration to your technical and cost proposals?
20.	ORALS AND TECHNICAL DEMONSTRATION:  The Forest Service contemplates requesting Offerors in the Competitive Range to participate in a single day meeting per Offeror that includes (1) oral presentations of the Offeror's Technical Approach, (2) demonstrations of the Offeror's technical tools (such as the Knowledge Management System, Situational Awareness System, and Ticketing System) and (3) oral discussions of proposal weaknesses and deficiencies.  Please provide your comments on this approach.
21.	INCENTIVES FOR KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT: The Government's pricing model is intended to incentivize the Contractor to invest substantially in the development of Knowledge documents and a Knowledge Management System for its own agents as well as for use by Forest Service end users.  How does the Fixed Price Strategy accomplish this goal?
22.	TASK ORDER APPROACH:  The Government is contemplating issuing six (6) Calls against the BPA, one (1) for the remainder of Fiscal Year 2008; one (1) for each of four (4) succeeding fiscal years (2009 through 2012); and one (1) for the first six (6) months of Fiscal Year 2013 (to include transition to a succeeding contractor).  With the Offeror's Proposal the Government intends to request the Offeror's fixed Price Proposal for each band (as indicated in Section L.1, sub-section 3) for each period/Call, with the resulting best value award.  Please discuss pros and cons to this approach.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Components/Peripherals Items for FDA's PC Refresh Program
<DESC>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to include open market items on a General Services Administration Federal Acquisition Service award to Lenovo, Inc. for the solution to its overall Personal Computer (PC) Refresh Program.  The open market items include port replicators, keyboards, mice, docking stations, and carrying cases.  These items complete Lenovo's overall solution to the FDA's PC Refresh requirements.  The solution was proposed during a competitive comparison using the General Services Administration's Federal Acquisition Service and Department of Health and Human Services' Blanket Purchase Agreements for Personal Computers.  The procurement for providing the overall solution is closed.  Acquiring the units and these components from one source will provide a single point of contact for ordering, staging deliveries, and accountability for delivery issues and non-performing units or components.  Due to the quantities being ordered and multiple delivery locations, it is of paramount importance to ensure that deliveries are appropriately coordinated and FDA's administrative oversight is minimized. The period of performance for this requirement is from date of award through September 30, 2010.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 13.501(a) and no other solution will satisfy agency requirements.  The NAICS code is 334111 and the size standard is 1000 employees.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations and no solicitation document is available.  However, any firm that believes it can meet these requirements may give notification to the Contracting Officer by 8:00am local eastern time on July 5, 2007.  Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirement.  Information can be emailed to the Contracting Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Attn: Sandra Bellinger at the email below.  Responses received will be reviewed, however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  If no responses are received, the FDA will proceed with the sole source award to Lenovo, Inc., One Manhattanville Road, Suite PH, Purchase, New York, 10577.  The anticipated award date of this contract is on or around July 7, 2007.  No collect calls will be accepted.

The 2007 PDR Brownfields Report will be used as the basis for organizing the agenda and structure of the symposium.  GREAT LAKES ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING (GLEP) is uniquely qualified to carry out this purchase order because it has spent several months studying and documenting the policies and practices of HUD field offices in managing and administering HUD housing development programs in urban brownfield areas.  Only Great Lakes Environmental Planning is the only logical candidate to carry out this follow-up effort to the study of HUD's policies and practices in supporting housing development at former urban brownfields sites.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS.  The intent of this notice is for information purposes only.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements), HUD intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, however, the Government will consider all proposals received within 15 days after due date of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>D -- SOLE SOURCE ANNOUNCEMENT - MAF/TIGER SUPPORT
<DESC>Under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation, Part 6, Subparts 6.301 and 6.302, the U.S. Census Bureau intends to contract with Oracle Corporation on a sole source basis.  This contract will allow the Geography Division to continue receiving the services provided by the Oracle Corporation through an earlier contract in support of the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) System.       

The Census Bureau has implemented a major initiative to modernize its geographic support infrastructure, the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) System. The Geography Division has modernized its computer processing environment from one that is "home-grown" and arcane, but with highly efficient and time-tested accuracy, to an environment that takes advantage of modern commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) database management systems (DBMS) and COTS/GIS computer processing technology. The MAF/TIGER System is the core of the Geographic Support System, which provides geographic products and services to a wide array of Census Bureau surveys, censuses, and programs.  A variety of applications are being developed for the new MAF/TIGER system.  A key component of the redesign was the replacement of the homegrown database system with an Oracle database system, to house the new MAF/TIGER database.  In addition, because MAF/TIGER is a spatial database, Oracle Spatial is being used, including a new component called Oracle Spatial Topology Model, which allows the storage of spatial data in the topological format needed by the MAF/TIGER system.  Oracle?s expertise is critical to the success of this project.

<SUBJECT>--Synopsis of Proposed Contract Action for Transportable Detonation Chamber
<DESC>It is anticipated that a sole source contract will be awarded, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, to CH2M Hill as a follow-on contract action for the continuation of further developmental and operational testing of its highly specialized Transportable D etonation Chamber (TDC).   The TDC has been identified and previously tested by the Government as a potential technology capable of addressing large and extra large buried Recovered Chemical Warfare Material (RCWM) on site.  The TDC is anticipated to provide the Army with an alterna te technology that will address high quantities of RCWM in a manner that will be cost effective, efficient in terms of schedule, and minimizes the generation of hazardous wastes.  The subject contract action is anticipated to include the following:  mobili zation of the TDC to Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii, setup and destruction of RCWM, and decontamination and demobilization of the TDC.  The period of performance is anticipated to be 12 months from date of award including a 3 month operational period of the TDC. The supplies and/or services have been deemed to be available only from one source for the continued development or production of the required system as CH2M HILL has demonstrated their experience and capabilities in providing these unique services under t heir previous contracts and have extensive, demonstrated past experience and institutional knowledge that is critical to the follow-on testing and its successful completion.  The continuation of follow-on testing, utilizing the original highly qualified so urce, represents the logical conclusion of the previous efforts and will provide the continuity for the completion of the TDC testing.  The appropriate Justification and Approval has been approved in accordance with FAR 6.304.  The proposed contract action is for supplies and services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate, utilizing Alpha contracting techniques, with CH2M Hill under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  As such, no written request for proposal will b e issued.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.

<SUBJECT>--Non-Articulated Mannequin/sensors for evaluation of flame-resistant fabrics.
<DESC>The US Army Natick Soldier Center (NSC) intends to award a Sole Source contract to Composites USA, Inc., Northeast, MD, for the manufacture of a second non-articulated mannequin, with related sensors, designed to assist in the testing of fire-retarda nt fabrics and clothing in accordance with ASTM F 1930.

The purpose of this testing is to develop protective clothing for troops deployed in hostile areas ove rseas exposed to the threat of Improvised Explosive Devices.  The rationale for other than full and open competition is that it has been determined that Composites USA is the only current provider of mannequin/sensor systems that will allow ASTM F 1930 tes ting to be performed; this is because of a proprietary agreement between the manufacturer of the required sensors and Composites USA.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subparts 12.6 and 13.5, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-07-R-010057 is being assigned to this procurement for tracking purposes only. This is a request for proposal (RFP).  NAICS code: 332999 Size standard: 500.  The incorporated clauses and provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-17. This requirement is restricted to SMALL BUSINESSES.  
This synopsis/solicitation is issued for the acquisition of products variously called work stands, inspection stands, and work platforms which will be used on the United States Coast Guard's HC-144 aircraft.  The commercial version of this aircraft is the CASA CN235-300M aircraft.  The USCG can not provide blueprints, drawings, dimensions, or specification of the aircraft or any components.  Interested offerors will be given a chance to view the aircraft and take measurements and photos on 11 July 2007 at 10:00am.  This will be the only date and time offered.  Interested offerors will need to contact CWO Dorsey Johr by e-mail at Dorsey.H.Johr@USCG.mil. Please provide name, nationality, place of birth, and point of contact details to CWO Johr no less then 1 day prior to arriving at the base.
The Governments objective is to obtain products, variously called work/check stands, inspection stands, and work platforms.  The stands must be easy to move and transportable from the hanger to the flight-line.  The stands will be used for CASA CN235-300M aircraft in performing inspections and operator level maintenance in both a hanger environment and outside on the flight line.  Stands must be durable, stable, and weather resistant because they may be used inside a hanger environment or outside on the flight line.  The majority of use of the stands is anticipated to be for operator inspection and maintenance purposes within a hanger; however, the stands may be routinely stored outside. Stands should require a maximum of 3 personnel to move using wheels to ease the effort.  Stands must be specifically built to the airframe dimensions of the CN235-300M aircraft, i.e.: wing height, engine/prop height/width, and horizontal/vertical stabilizer height/width, and fuselage to landing gear sponson interface. The USCG is not looking for universal or multiple use check stands, i.e. B1, B4A, and etc. however the USCG anticipates the stands will be similar.  Stands should be free from sharp edges, burrs and other hazards that could harm or damage aircraft or personnel.  Stands must have protective padding to protect aircraft where contact between the stand and the aircraft are likely to occur.  Stands should have platforms which allow a minimum of 2 average sized people (180 pounds) to stand on the platform at one time.  Stands need not provide for utility connections such as electric or air.  Stands should have locking wheels and potentially could be offered with mechanism for adjustments to account for uneven surfaces.  Coverage of the various stands should include, and allow work to be performed in/on, props, engine, nose and cockpit window area, flap area top/bottom, horizontal stabilizer top/bottom, wing area top/bottom, and the top of the fuselage.  Access to the full height of the vertical stabilizer will not be required.  It is envisioned that offerors will propose a system of various individual stands covering one or more areas of the aircraft aimed primarily at operator-type maintenance, as opposed to one single stand used more traditionally for depot level work.  After the USCG gains additional operational and maintenance experience will be to buy an unknown number of the various individual stands for specific areas of the plane.  Additionally, if the contractor offers a propeller stand for use with the Hamilton Sundstrand 14 RF-37, the Government will consider purchasing that stand as a separate option.  All stands must meet applicable OSHA standards and (American welding Society) AWS standards for soundness and safety.  The desired delivery date from time of award is 50 days after placement of each order including the initial order; however, the Government will consider other delivery times.  The Government can not provide specifications, plans, drawings, or other technical data.  Limited data can be found at: http://www.blm.gov/style/medialib/blm/nifc/aviation/smokejumper.Par.31323.File.dat/CN235Report.pdf   Note that the Government does not warrant the accuracy of any data contained in these internet links.
--Contract period: This contract will have a base period with 5 option periods.  The BASE PERIOD will be date of contract award through the following SIX-MONTH period; OPTION PERIOD ONE will be the one-year period following the base period; OPTION PERIOD TWO will be the one-year period following the first option; OPTION PERIOD THREE will be the one-year period following the second option; OPTION PERIOD FOUR will be the one-year period following the third option; OPTION PERIOD FIVE will be the six-month period following the fourth option.
--CLIN Structure for proposals:   Offeror's proposal should list each separate section of the maintenance stands as a separate CLIN. Additionally, if the Offeror produces a propeller stand for use with the Hamilton Sundstrand 14 RF-37, this CLIN should be listed as optional and not part of the complete system.  The base should have CLINS starting in 01, option year one should start with 02, option year two should start with 03, option year three should start with 04, option year four should start with 05, and the last option should start with 06.  Each portion of the stand and any optional stand offered should then be sequentially numbered within the appropriate period.  The following CLIN structure is for example purposes only:  Base year: 01002 Wheel Stand, 01002 Nose Stand, 01003 Optional Propeller stand.  For the first option year: 02001 Wheel Stand, 02002 Nose Stand, 02003 Optional propeller stand.  All quantities listed should be for the quantity of 1 each.  If more then one stand of a particular type is needed for the complete set due to design or interconnection, this should be clearly identified in the proposal.  An example of this might be an engine platform stand where a specific maintenance stand is needed for the port engine and a different maintenance stand is needed for the starboard engine of the aircraft.  Prices offered should be FOB origin, freight prepaid to the addresses shown below.  All prices will be firm-fixed prices for the base and all option periods.
--Purchase quantities are as follows:  The USCG estimates buying a total of 6 complete sets and estimates no more then 35 of any one separate sections over the life of this contract and any exercised options.  The USCG will buy two complete sets, defined as one of each section, during the base period at time of award.  Orders for additional sets or individual sections will be placed by delivery order during the base period or any exercised options as needs develop.  Additional quantities are estimates only; failure of the government to order any of the items described as estimated shall not entitle the contractor to any equitable adjustment.  It is anticipated that the USCG will eventually acquire a total of 35+ of the CASA aircraft.
--Inspection and acceptance shall be performed in accordance with FAR 52.212-4 by DCMC.  Purchased stands will be shipped to the addresses specified in each delivery order.  The first of the two sets purchased during the base period will be sent to USCG Aircraft Repair and Supply Center, Attn: Receiving Section, Bldg. 63, Elizabeth City, NC  27909-5001.  POC Dorsey Johr at 252-334-5115.  The second set will be shipped to CASA HC-144A Maintenance Officer, USCG Aviation Training Center, 8501 Tanner Williams Rd., Mobile, AL  36608.  POC for mobile is CWO3 Ken Hardenbrook 251-441-5070.  Delivery is desired within 50 days after receipt of contract and any additional delivery orders.

(End of provision)
--NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  
It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:  Commandant (G-A), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC 20593 Telephone:(202)372-3692 Fax:(202)475-3904

P.       EVALUATION FACTORS:
The Government intends to make a single award to the responsive and responsible firm whose quote is most advantageous to the Government, price and non-price related factors considered.  The Government does reserve the right to make multiple awards. The Technical evaluation factors are Technical and Management Plan and Past Performance.  Technical and Management Plan is more important than Past Performance.  When combined these technical evaluation factors are more important than price.  As the technical evaluation of quotes approaches equality, greater will be the importance of price in making the award determination.  In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences (i.e. are technically equivalent), award may be made to the lower priced quote.  It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.  Awards may also be made on the basis of initial quotes without discussions. Quoters are therefore cautioned that each initial quote should contain the quoters best terms. 

Technical and Management Plan: The technical and management plan shall identify the organizational structure, staffing, operating procedures, and employee benefits of the firm.  The plan shall also include the technical approach to successfully provide these services ensuring no lapse in staffing.  The plan shall include an entry and exit transition plan .The plan shall describe the quoters personnel and administrative management approach, with respect to the managing corporate office?s geographic location and how it plans to effectively manage on-site personnel (i.e. supervision, disciplinary actions, etc.) and administrative matters.  The personnel and administrative management approach must sufficiently demonstrate the quoters capabilities in taking an active role in the day to day supervision, management, and administrative tasks for on-site personnel.   

The plan should be simple, easy to read and clearly describe contractor responsibilities, any proposed subcontracting arrangements and communication and coordination plans with the Government.  The technical and management plan shall also include a brief description of firm?s contingency and continuity of operations plans in the event of natural or manmade disasters that may disrupt service capabilities (A full blown continuity of operations plan (COOP) is not required).  

For the purposes of this requirement, contractor personnel are not considered ?Key Personnel? as prescribed by HSAR Clause 3052.215-70.  However, DHS does reserve the right to review resumes prior to individual placement.  
Past Performance:   The quoter shall identify three (3) contracts/orders that demonstrate recent and relevant past performance.   Recent is defined as within the last three (3) years.   Relevant is defined as work similar in complexity and magnitude to the work identified in the SOW.   Please include the following information: a) Project Title; b) Description of the Project;  c) Contract/Task Order Number; d) Contract/Task Order Amount; e) Government; f) Agency/ Organization; g) COTR?s name, address, phone number and email address; h) Contracting Officer?s name, address, telephone number and email address; i) Current status, e.g. completed and/or in progress, start and estimated completion dates; j) A brief narrative of why your firm believes this reference is relevant to the proposed task.

Price:     The price quote shall include the following: Fully burdened on-site hourly rates for each proposed labor category for the base period and for each option period.  The United States Department of Labor (DOL) Wage Determination No: 05-2103 Rev No. 3 (Effective 05/29/2007) is incorporated into this solicitation.  Secretary Levels IV and V shall be provided to reflect the current U.S. DOL Wage Determination, provided herein, as Administrative Assistant - No. 01020.  The DOL Wage Determination may be viewed in detail at http://www.dol.gov.  

The technical quote submission shall be limited to 15 one-sided pages (inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.) and the past performance section shall be limited to 2 one-sided pages (also inclusive of cover pages, charts, graphs, tabs, etc.)     The price quote has no page limitations.  All quotes should be provided with a cover page and table of contents for both the Technical and the Price sections.  No pricing information is to be provided within the quoter?s technical quote.  The font for submissions shall be set at Arial [no smaller than] 11 with 1 inch margins.  All responses shall be submitted in MS Word.  

Q.       SUBMISSION OF QUOTE
All quotes, both technical and price, are due no later than July 10, 2007, 2:00pm,  Washington, D.C. time.   Quotes are to be e-mailed to Mr. Bernard Salter, Jr. at  bernard.salter@dhs.gov.   Faxed quotes will not be accepted.  Please note that any administrative costs or expenses incurred by quoters in responding to this solicitation are NOT reimbursable by the government.  The Contracting Officer  may at any time, via amendment to this RFQ, alter acquisition strategy, readdress the requirement, or effect administrative changes as he or she deems necessary.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This notice is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) for a YAG Laser System (one each) with the following specifications: 1. The laser system, hereafter referred to as the 'laser', shall be a Q-switched flashlamp-pumped Nd:YAG type with a second harmonic (532 nm) output and means of separating the fundamental 1064 nm light from the 532 nm using dichroic mirrors. 2. The laser light output characteristics at 532 nm shall have at least 380 mJ per pulse of energy at a repetition rate of 20 Hz, with a minimum temporal width of 8 ns (fwhm), and a maximum spectral bandwidth of 1 cm-1 (fwhm). 3. The laser shall have at most, 0.05 mrad of beam pointing stability and +/- 3 % pulse-to-pulse energy stability. 4. The laser shall have a 'long-pulse' mode to permit the safe and accurate beam alignment at full flashlamp power.  The long pulse mode generates a series of very low energy pulses of order 2 mJ cumulative energy within the pump envelope of the lasing medium at a rep rate of 20 Hz.	This mode is a mission critical requirement. 5. The laser shall be powered by 220 VAC single-phase electrical power at 25 amps. 6. The laser shall require no more than 2.0 gal/min of cooling water flow at 50 psi and 70 deg F. 7. The laser shall have gold-plated elliptical flashlamp pump chambers for maximum power efficiency, with field-replaceable lamps that do not alter laser alignment.  The gold plated elliptical pump chambers are a mission critical requirement as they provide the most uniform laser rod illumination and have the longest longevity to minimize downtime of the laser. 8. The laser shall have a means of automatically circulating the de-ionized water system to prevent contamination of wetted optical surfaces. 9. The laser power supply cabinet shall have a maximum height of 29.5 inches in order to fit underneath standard optical tables during use. 10. The Contractor shall offer their standard commercial warranty. The provisions and clauses in the RFQ are those in effect through FAC 05-17. The NAICS Code and the small business size standard for this procurement are 334510 and 500 employees respectively.  The offeror shall state in their offer their size status for this procurement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial item services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-17.  This solicitation is set aside for small businesses, NAICS 238910, Construction equipment rental with operator, with a small business size standard of $13.0 million average annual gross receipts for the past three years.  The National Park Service encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.  The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible offeror whose total offer is the most advantageous for the Government, price and other factors considered. BACKGROUND North Cascades NPS Complex is responsible for storm damage repair of roads and campgrounds. We have needs for heavy equipment to perform a variety of maintenance tasks.  This contract will establish rates and procedures for heavy equipment rental with operator to assist with NPS operations, particularly to repair flood-damaged areas.  During July through October, 2007, we plan to repair the Cascade River Road and Colonial Creek campground, and the drainage structures at Rhode Creek.  Additional work may be required between October and December, 2007, if there is more flood damage. The Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) will determine whether we will rent trucks or trucks with pups at the time we call for trucking service.  We cannot determine in advance the exact number of hours of truck hauling required.  The Park also has intermittent needs for crushed rock to repair and resurface gravel roads, but cannot determine in advance the exact quantity required.  We intend to establish an "Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity" (IDIQ) fixed-price contract for 10-yard dump trucks hauling gravel and rock, with or without "pups", an excavator with operator, and 1-1/4" minus crushed rock. Lodging and meal services are available in the area on a limited basis.  Cellular phones generally do not work and there is no public Internet access.  Information about the park can be found at www.nps.gov/noca . SCOPE OF WORK  Contractor will provide all needed equipment, labor, and transportation required to provide the service requested. All equipment to be called out and tasks to be performed shall be at the request of the Contracting Officer or a duly authorized Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).  All work shall be in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications shown below.  For work not specifically covered in the following specifications, performance of the work required will be as directed by the Contracting Officer's Representative. The work required by this contract represents requirements in excess of the quantities that the government may itself perform.  All work will be ordered and directed by the COR and shall be accomplished within the times specified for each task. This IDIQ contract will remain in effect from date of award until December 31, 2007.  Estimated total contract value is <$100,000. EQUIPMENT RENTAL The contractor shall provide 10- or 12-cubic yard heavy-haul trucks and optional pups, in good condition, with fully licensed drivers.  The contractor shall be responsible for the safe and legal condition and operation of the trucks.  Hauling will take place, in part, during the summer tourist season and on State Route 20.  Truck rental time shall begin when trucks arrive at the project at the time set by the COR.  This time will usually be 7:00 or 7:30 AM.  A half-hour lunch break shall be afforded at approximately 12:00 noon, but NPS will not pay for lunch breaks or time when the truck or trailer is not able to operate legally or safely.  Materials will be loaded by contractor's or NPS' employees and drivers shall deliver and dump loads as directed by the COR or project inspector.   Gravel and rock will be hauled from Rhode Creek to Newhalem pit and/or up the CRR to approximately milepost 20.  Drivers will not be required to manipulate materials after dumping them.  At different times in the contract period we will require the use of varying numbers of trucks, with and without pups.  At no time will we require more than 4 trucks (two solo and two with pups) simultaneously.   The excavator will be operated by the contractor's employee(s) to load materials into the contractor's trucks and/or pups.  It must be leak-free, and all servicing must occur off-site. Contractor shall provide: 	a.  Excavator with thumb (John Deere 490 or equivalent or larger, with operator)  	b.  10- or 12-cubic yard solo dump truck; minimum of 2 each, with operator 	c.  10- or 12-cubic yard dump truck with pup trailer (18-cubic yard total capacity minimum); minimum of 2 each, with operator 	d.  You may offer other similar or complimentary equipment as well (e.g. grader). CRUSHED ROCK The materials to be purchased under this contract shall comply with WSDOT specification for "Crushed Surfacing Base Course"; shot and crushed rock, nominally 1.25" to dust.  Two known sources are the Gold Hill Quarry near Darrington and the Martin Marietta pit in Mount Vernon.  State your source and furnish proof that it is crushed shot rock and meets the WSDOT specification with your quote.  NPS will not accept river or pit run crushed rock.  Pricing will be per ton, delivered and spread as directed by the COR or appointee.   All orders will be placed in approximately full truckload increments.  In general, the crushed rock deliveries shall be tailgate-spread in approximately three inch lifts on the road surface by the truck, as directed by the COR; no handwork is required by the contractor.  We may have some crushed rock delivered in piles.   Each truckload of purchased materials shall be accompanied by a delivery ticket showing the date, product, weight (as determined by a certified scale), and delivery location.  The ticket shall be in duplicate.  It is the contractor's responsibility to obtain the signature of an NPS representative at the delivery point, and to give them one copy of the ticket.   DELIVERY SCHEDULE Start date for excavator and trucks is soon after contract award. This start date may be postponed based on when the hydraulic permit is issued. Estimated end date for this work is October 31, 2007, unless future flood damage occurs.  Requests for delivery and utilization of contract services will be at least 3 days in advance and will be coordinated by the NPS to coincide with other projects and repairs.  Delivery of crushed rock will likely occur in July and August, 2007, and may be coordinated to coincide with road grading; exact dates will be established in consultation with the grading contractor and the COR. DELIVERY LOCATIONS All work required by this contract will be performed in or near North Cascades National Park Service Complex, in areas accessible from State Route 20.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  

JUSTIFICATION

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity.
	Agency: DISA, Satellite Management Branch (GS221), Falls Church, VA 22204
	
	Contracting Activity: DISA/DITCO, 2300 East Drive, Scott Air Force Base, IL 62225-5406.

2.  Nature/Description of Action(s).
A Competitive source ?Specific Make and Model? procurement using FY07 Appropriated funding. This action is for the DISA Satellite Management Branch that is responsible for the Standardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP) sustainment program.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.
DISA/GS221 requires the purchase of two CISCO Model 7613 routers. The requirement cannot be satisfied unless the following specifications/capabilities are satisfied:
Cisco Router 7613
	-All systems must meet the specifications listed on attached requirements/materials list

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.
10 U.S.C.2304? (1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.
DISA/GS221 requests the purchase of the above routers. Primary reasons for recommending CISCO are as follows:

a. CICSO 7613 routers are the lifecycle replacement of the existing CISCO 7507 routers that currently support extension of data services. These routers will allow DISA/GS221 to complete this year?s lifecycle replacement of older systems. The existing routers have reached end of life, and maintenance contracts will not be extended or renewed on these devices.

b. Interoperability and compatibility with current hardware:  CISCO 7613 routers being purchased will 
be fully compatible with systems already managed in the DISA/GS21 Data Networks.

c. DISA/GS21 provides the network management and support for the entire Data Network. The new routers being purchased will be a one for one replacement, and will ?fit? into the existing architecture that already has several hundred routers in the network. The installation, operation and maintenance will be essentially seamless with the purchase of these devices. This will reduce down time and increased responsiveness, as DISA/GS21 already has the existing expertise and has technicians within each theater that are trained and certified to work on these devices. Additional update and refresher training will be provided to ensure the existing personnel are fully qualified on all new designs and hardware.

d. Costs: CISCO costs are highly competitive and market research indicates that costs will be either equal or below to other systems available.

Originator?s Code DISA/GS221

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  

JUSTIFICATION

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity.
	Agency: DISA, Satellite Management Branch (GS221), Falls Church, VA 22204
	
	Contracting Activity: DISA/DITCO, 2300 East Drive, Scott Air Force Base, IL 62225-5406.

2.  Nature/Description of Action(s).
A Competitive source ?Specific Make and Model? procurement using FY07 Appropriated funding. This action is for the DISA Satellite Management Branch that is responsible for the Standardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP) sustainment program.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.
DISA/GS221 requires the purchase of two CISCO Model 7613 routers. The requirement cannot be satisfied unless the following specifications/capabilities are satisfied:
Cisco Router 7613
	-All systems must meet the specifications listed on attached requirements/materials list

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.
10 U.S.C.2304? (1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.
DISA/GS221 requests the purchase of the above routers. Primary reasons for recommending CISCO are as follows:

a. CICSO 7613 routers are the lifecycle replacement of the existing CISCO 7507 routers that currently support extension of data services. These routers will allow DISA/GS221 to complete this year?s lifecycle replacement of older systems. The existing routers have reached end of life, and maintenance contracts will not be extended or renewed on these devices.

b. Interoperability and compatibility with current hardware:  CISCO 7613 routers being purchased will 
be fully compatible with systems already managed in the DISA/GS21 Data Networks.

c. DISA/GS21 provides the network management and support for the entire Data Network. The new routers being purchased will be a one for one replacement, and will ?fit? into the existing architecture that already has several hundred routers in the network. The installation, operation and maintenance will be essentially seamless with the purchase of these devices. This will reduce down time and increased responsiveness, as DISA/GS21 already has the existing expertise and has technicians within each theater that are trained and certified to work on these devices. Additional update and refresher training will be provided to ensure the existing personnel are fully qualified on all new designs and hardware.

d. Costs: CISCO costs are highly competitive and market research indicates that costs will be either equal or below to other systems available.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to provide answers to questions that have been received regarding this procurement.  The quotation due date of 7/10/07 has not been extended by this amendment. <br><br>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS<br><br><b>Question 1:</b>  I noticed that the photographs of the Secretaries were all head shots with the exception of the one of Secretary Cuomo.  Will full figure photographs be provided?<br><br>Answer 1:  We can supply additional photographs if available from within in our library or from the National Archive Records Administration (NARA) at the time of contract(s) award.<br><br><b>Question 2:</b>  The one of Secretary Cuomo was seated, will you require this be changed to a standing portrait?<br><br>Answer 2:  Yes.<br><br><b>Question 3:</b>  Was there a reason that the portraits of Secretaries Romney, Lynn, and Pierce were omitted from the samples sent?<br><br>Answer 3:  At this time, this procurement is for the five (5) HUD Secretaries listed in the Statement of Work.  Note: the portraits for Secretaries Romney, Lynn and Pierce have already been completed.<br><br><b>Question 4:</b>  Will there be color photographs provided, and will any full figure photographs showing the subject's hand be given as well?<br><br>Answer 4:  We can search for those type of pictures if that helps.<br><br><b>Question 5:</b>  I have printed out the photographs sent of the subjects. With the exception of the photograph of Secretary Alphonso Jackson, I would be far better served if I could have an original rather than a transmission of their official photographs.  Secretary Jackson was excellent, the others did not come through as well as I might hope.  May I assume that this would be made available?<br><br>Answer 5:  We can supply original prints in color of the subjects but they may not be in the standing position.

JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL
TO PROCURE USING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Upon the basis of the following justification, I, as Contracting Officer, hereby approve the use of other than full and open competition of the proposed contractual action pursuant to the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).  

JUSTIFICATION

1.  Agency and Contracting Activity.
	Agency: DISA, Satellite Management Branch (GS221), Falls Church, VA 22204
	
	Contracting Activity: DISA/DITCO, 2300 East Drive, Scott Air Force Base, IL 62225-5406.

2.  Nature/Description of Action(s).
A Competitive source ?Specific Make and Model? procurement using FY07 Appropriated funding. This action is for the DISA Satellite Management Branch that is responsible for the Standardized Tactical Entry Point (STEP) sustainment program.

3.  Description of Supplies/Services.
DISA/GS221 requires the purchase of two CISCO Model 7613 routers. The requirement cannot be satisfied unless the following specifications/capabilities are satisfied:
Cisco Router 7613
	-All systems must meet the specifications listed on attached requirements/materials list

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority.
10 U.S.C.2304? (1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

5.  Demonstration of Contractor?s Unique Qualifications.
DISA/GS221 requests the purchase of the above routers. Primary reasons for recommending CISCO are as follows:

a. CICSO 7613 routers are the lifecycle replacement of the existing CISCO 7507 routers that currently support extension of data services. These routers will allow DISA/GS221 to complete this year?s lifecycle replacement of older systems. The existing routers have reached end of life, and maintenance contracts will not be extended or renewed on these devices.

b. Interoperability and compatibility with current hardware:  CISCO 7613 routers being purchased will 
be fully compatible with systems already managed in the DISA/GS21 Data Networks.

c. DISA/GS21 provides the network management and support for the entire Data Network. The new routers being purchased will be a one for one replacement, and will ?fit? into the existing architecture that already has several hundred routers in the network. The installation, operation and maintenance will be essentially seamless with the purchase of these devices. This will reduce down time and increased responsiveness, as DISA/GS21 already has the existing expertise and has technicians within each theater that are trained and certified to work on these devices. Additional update and refresher training will be provided to ensure the existing personnel are fully qualified on all new designs and hardware.

d. Costs: CISCO costs are highly competitive and market research indicates that costs will be either equal or below to other systems available.

<DESC>The purpose of this document is to amend reference synopsis/solicitation. Part I represents questions and answers to potential offeror concerns.  Part II represents language that is deleted and/or added:

Part I: - Below are IRS? answers to timely received industry questions. 

Question1:  	What is the average payment? 
Answer 1:  	IRS anticipates that the average payment for each kiosk cash transition to be $550.00

Question 2:	What are largest payments? 
Answer 2:	IRS anticipates that the largest payment will be $6,000.

Question 3:	Is there a limit to how much currency you will accept from one payer? 
Answer 3:	No, IRS does not have a currency limitation restriction.

Question 4:	When do you receive these payments? 	
Answer 4:	IRS receives payments throughout the year. 

Question 5:	Are they spread evenly throughout the month or, are they clustered around the specific dates?
Answer 5:	The volume for receipt of payments is heaviest from June 1st to August 31st.

Question 6:	Will there be a connection available for the kiosk? If so, what type (dial-up, DSL, Networtk, etc.).
Answer 6:	The IRS will provide a telephone line.  The offeror must provide the appropriate telecommunication speed to ensure quality and timely service.

Question 7:	Our armored carrier drivers will normally carry a sidearm during their daily rounds. They are licensed and insured in every state. What rules/regulations will they encounter in the IRS locations? Are they allowed to carry a weapon onto the property? This may impact the level of risk exposure for the drivers and subsequently, the cost of the cash management portion of the process. 
Answer 7:	The armed carriers will be allowed to carry their weapons while performing services under this contract. 




Question 8:	[Third Party] License Agreement.
Our cash management partner requires the site operator, in this case the Internal Revenue Service, sign a separate Site Operator Agreement. This agreement clarifies the ownership of the currency inside the kiosk and insures the bank will have access to the kiosk. I have attached a copy of the agreement for your review. 
Answer 8:	IRS does not enter into separate third party agreements.  Contracts/agreements such as that must be signed by the small business and the third party.  The contract the IRS signs will be with the small business that receives this award.  That contract between the IRS and the small business must contain all the binding language to fulfill this requirement.  

Part II:
1)  Throughout the synopsis/solicitation, DELETE reference to ?Department of Treasury? and ADD ?Department of the Treasury?.  


2)    In Section I ? Supplies or Services and Prices make the following changes:

DELETE the following table heading:

The contractor shall take steps to correct the problem to ensure continued proper operation of the kiosk machine.  The contractor is solely responsible for completethe initial kiosks with this feature. 

Answer 11:	The ADA does not require that these machines have audio capability.  More specifically, the discussion relative to auditory output at 1194.25 does not require audio capability it even though it gives guidance for when it is used.


Question 12:	Section (e) Performance Work Statement, #4 Kiosk Locations (page 8-9).
The fourth sentence states ?The contractor shall ensure to have each kiosk machine delivered and operational at the specified location within two weeks of notice.?

Answer 12:	See Part II, Section II below. 

 
Question 13:	I found the solicitation on FBO and also pulled it up from the IRS procurement website.  In doing a quick read through it appears some documentation (company name, POC, etc) was due yesterday by 11:00 am if we were interested in responding.  If we did not submit that, are we still qualified to respond to the RFP?

To:  All Small Business Potential Offerors

Subject:  TIRNO-07-R-00011 - Amendment 2 

Reference:  Synopsis/Solicitation number TIRNO-07-R-00011 ? Kiosk Machine Leasing


The purpose of this document is to amend reference synopsis/solicitation. Part I represents questions and answers to potential offeror concerns.  Part II represents language that is deleted and/or added.

Please note the following:
1)  The closing date and time have been extended ? Part II see changes below.

2)  In accordance with FAR Part 52.212-1(k), offerors must be currently registered in the Central Contractor Registration system in order to receive a government award.  Go to www.ccr.gov or call 1-888-227-2423 for more information.


Part I: - Below are IRS? answers to timely received industry questions. 

Question 9:	We want to clarify the timeline expectations for the development phase of the project. Because the application will require custom development we anticipate a development time of 10 weeks. During this period of time, [our company] will meet with the Internal Revenue Services? project team to finalize the business processes. We will design and build the User Interface and reporting documentation. These applications will then go through a process of Quality Assurance and Testing.

Answer 9:  	See Part II, Section II changes below below.  


Question 10:	Section (e) Performance Work Statement, #2 Performance Work Statement (page 8). 
The fourth paragraph requires that every morning the kiosk have at least 75% of the total amount of receipt paper and money order paper available. It also states, that the kiosk machine has no more than 25% of the total capacity of money in the currency acceptor.

We will be unable to comply with this requirement during the initial phase due to the potentially wide variance in payment volumes and the unknown issues of payment amounts and the corresponding bill count.  [Our company] proposes that we address the issue of service level availability in Attachment A ? Performance Matrix.  It is our expectation to maintain the kiosks at an uptime rate of 98% or greater. The Deduction Schedule lists a variety of schedule levels with associated penalties for non-compliance. 

[The company] understands the need for and is committed to delivering the highest level of service possible to the Internal Revenue Service. Presently, our service levels expectations are very similar to those specified. However, due to the uncertain nature and potential variability of the initial phase of the Base Year of May 2007-September 30, 2007, we will request the financial penalties be suspended. It is our goal to work closely with the Internal Revenue Service in delivering a solid program and to track closely to the performance matrix. But, based upon our past experience with other self-service projects, we anticipate there will be modifications to the project that may impact the service levels.

Answer 10:	In accordance with FAR Part 37.601(b), the government must have measurable performance standards and a methodology of assessing those standards.  Therefore, IRS is unable to remove the performance standards. 

	With respect to the ?unknown issues of payment amounts and the corresponding bill count?, see Amendment 1 to this synopsis/solicitation for more information on IRS? estimated cash transactions.

Question 11:	Section (e) Performance Work Statement, #3 Product Specification (page 8).

6)  In Section V ? Evaluation of Offers:

A)  In paragraph 2, make the following changes:

DELETE  ? paragraph 2 in its entirety.

ADD ? ?The Government anticipates awarding a contract resulting from this solicitation.  If an award is made, it will be to the responsive offeror conforming to the solicitation that will represent the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered using a pass/fail and adjectival evaluation methodology.  

The selection will consist of a Best Value source selection process where submittals will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria first.  Then submittals will be evaluated using a price/technical trade-off process.  Evaluation of the best value criteria will focus on a thorough comprehension of the requirements as delineated in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) and as reflected in the soundness and adequacy of the offeror?s submittal package.  However, the IRS will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.  The non-price best value factors are listed in descending order of importance and, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. The Best value factors for selection are as follows (See Section IV ? Instructions to Offers):

1.	Acceptability of the requirement;
2.	Use of the offeror?s subcontracts;
3.	Organizational past performance;
4.	Compliance with the EIT accessibility standards;
5.	Organizational Experience

With respect to the factor number one (1) above, this factor will be evaluated on a pass or fail basis.  Offeror?s who receive a ?pass? rating, will be further evaluated for award.  In order for an offeror to receive a ?pass? rating, the offer must specifically state in their submittal package their acceptance of the requirement to provide a kiosk machine that only contains the functionalities listed within the performance work statement.  Offeror?s who receive a ?fail? rating will not be further evaluated and will not receive award.

With respect to factor number two (2) above, this factor will be evaluated on a pass or fail basis also.  Offeror?s who receive a ?pass? rating, will be further evaluated for award.  In order for an offeror to receive a ?pass? rating, the offer must specifically state in their submittal package that their subcontract effort will not exceed 49%.
 
The remaining factors speak to the offeror?s capabilities.  With respect to factor number three (3) above, Organizational Past performance will be evaluated to determine the success and/or failure of the offeror to meet the expectations of their contract and the firm/agency holding that contract.

With respect to factor number four (4) above, Compliance with the EIT standards will be evaluated to determine their compliance, or degree of compliance, with all the requirements as stated.  Those who are fully compliant will receive the highest possible evaluation.  Offerors who are compliant with the requirements as stated with only one requirement alteration, will receive a lessor evaluation, and so on.  The IRS will continue to evaluate offerors based on their ability to meet IRS standards.

With respect to factor number five (5) above, Organizational Experience will be evaluated to determine the breadth, depth, expertise and knowledge of the services and the offeror?s ability to meet IRS? PWS requirements to include, but not limited to, areas such as 1) schedule and 2) financial support services.   
[End of Provision]?

7)  In Attachment A ? Performance Matrix:
