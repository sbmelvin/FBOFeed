<p>The Department of State is conducting market research to identify capable businesses that can provide logistical services to support the lodging, transportation and conference space needs of one of the bureaus within the agency.  The Department of State, Bureau of Diplomatic Security,  Dignitary Protection Division (DS/P/DP)  has a requirement  for a company to provide and coordinate secure hotel / motel lodging, transportation  and conferencing space services domestically and internationally for government personnel, and to provide management and program support staff, including on-site support, for a base year and four option years.  The government contemplates an Indefinite Quantity, Indefinite Delivery (IDIQ) type contract.  The NAICS code for these services is 561510 Travel Agencies.  <br /> <br />The mission of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) includes "the protection of the Secretary of State and other senior government officials, visiting foreign dignitaries, and foreign missions in the United States."  The Bureau of Diplomatic Security is tasked with providing protection to visiting foreign dignitaries who attend U.S. sponsored meetings such as the G-8 meetings, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) meetings, and Organization of American States (OAS) meetings within the 50 states and territories.  A major portion of this mission involves the protection of dignitaries during the annual meeting of the United Nation General Assembly (UNGA) in New York City. <br /><br />In addition, DS is tasked with providing protection to U.S. athletes at international athletic events such as the Olympics Games, World Cup, Pan Am Games, etc.<br /><br />Support for domestic and international conferences and events are often short fused and require high tempo planning to successfully execute.  Support for international meetings may require domestic and/or international travel.  International athletic events require long term planning of approximately three years prior to the actual event, including multiple planning trips to overseas or international locations to identify potential sites for DS.  Potential sites may include hotel type facilities or dormitory type facilities for individual agents support and temporary facilities to support the DS Protective Detail including office space.  For meetings where the Secretary of State is not the senior U.S. official in attendance, coordination between other U.S. law enforcement agencies and various Department of Defense organizations may be required.  For these meetings, another contractor may have the lead in coordinating facility usage.  The contractor is expected to work seamlessly with that organization to ensure DS is able to execute its responsibilities.</p>

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />Defense Media Activity Communication <br />Notice Type: <br />Special Notice <br />Synopsis:
<p>Dear Industry Partner,</p>
<p>This is to advise Defense Media Activity (DMA) contractor community of the DMA plans regarding contract actions in the event that there is a lapse in appropriations.</p>
<p>As you are aware, the budget for fiscal year 2018 has not been enacted and may result in a lapse in the funds and resources required to administer existing DMA contracts. As a consequence of the lapse, certain existing contracts may be required to stop working, delay delivery, or other instructions, as outlined below.</p>
<p>This notice is for all DMA contractors.  No additional notification will be sent to DMA contractors unless specified, below.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>&bull;	The following type of DMA contract will not be affected by a lapse in funding: <br />A contract that has a period of performance that spans the lapse in appropriations, has sufficient funding, and, work can be conducted during the lapse without direct DMA technical oversight should continue performance.  DMA will not provide a separate notification or communication to these contracts.  Unless a contractor is provided a formal notification to the contrary, all DMA contractors are considered to fall into this category and must continue to comply with all terms, conditions, requirements and deliveries specified in their contract(s).</p>
<p>If, at any time, it is necessary to obtain direction or guidance from the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) or Contracting Officer (CO) assigned to this contract, you must immediately notify the e-mail address identified below and wait until guidance can be provided.</p>
<p>If, at any time, you run out of funding, you must immediately notify the e-mail address identified below and STOP WORK until the Government re-opens and guidance can be provided. Your organization is not authorized to continue performance beyond that period covered by the allotted funding and is cautioned to closely manage all available funding, as additional funding will not be provided while the Agency is without appropriations.</p>
<p>If, at any time, your period of performance expires or is about to expire, or your option period has expired or is about to expire, you need to immediately notify the Acquisitions POC identified at the end of this message.</p>
<p>&bull;	Excepted Contracts, mandated continuation of operation:<br />A contract that contained excepted functions will continue working during a lapse in appropriations, and, will be assigned a COR for DMA oversight.  These contracts typically protect property.  IT support is also excepted when it is needed to keep excepted functions going.

<DESC>Solicitation Number: <br />Defense Media Activity Communication <br />Notice Type: <br />Special Notice <br />Synopsis:
<p>Dear Industry Partner,</p>
<p>This is to advise Defense Media Activity (DMA) contractor community of the DMA plans regarding contract actions in the event that there is a lapse in appropriations.</p>
<p>As you are aware, the budget for fiscal year 2018 has not been enacted and may result in a lapse in the funds and resources required to administer existing DMA contracts. As a consequence of the lapse, certain existing contracts may be required to stop working, delay delivery, or other instructions, as outlined below.</p>
<p>This notice is for all DMA contractors.  No additional notification will be sent to DMA contractors unless specified, below.</p>
<p>CONTRACTOR INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>&bull;	The following type of DMA contract will not be affected by a lapse in funding: <br />A contract that has a period of performance that spans the lapse in appropriations, has sufficient funding, and, work can be conducted during the lapse without direct DMA technical oversight should continue performance.  DMA will not provide a separate notification or communication to these contracts.  Unless a contractor is provided a formal notification to the contrary, all DMA contractors are considered to fall into this category and must continue to comply with all terms, conditions, requirements and deliveries specified in their contract(s).</p>
<p>If, at any time, it is necessary to obtain direction or guidance from the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) or Contracting Officer (CO) assigned to this contract, you must immediately notify the e-mail address identified below and wait until guidance can be provided.</p>
<p>If, at any time, you run out of funding, you must immediately notify the e-mail address identified below and STOP WORK until the Government re-opens and guidance can be provided. Your organization is not authorized to continue performance beyond that period covered by the allotted funding and is cautioned to closely manage all available funding, as additional funding will not be provided while the Agency is without appropriations.</p>
<p>If, at any time, your period of performance expires or is about to expire, or your option period has expired or is about to expire, you need to immediately notify the Acquisitions POC identified at the end of this message.</p>
<p>&bull;	Excepted Contracts, mandated continuation of operation:<br />A contract that contained excepted functions will continue working during a lapse in appropriations, and, will be assigned a COR for DMA oversight.  These contracts typically protect property.  IT support is also excepted when it is needed to keep excepted functions going. Excepted contracts will be provided with a specific notification from the DMA.  These contractors must continue to comply with all terms, conditions, requirements and deliveries specified in their contract(s).</p>
<p><br />If your Contract requires access to DMA facilities, contact the points of contact below for guidance.  You may need to stop work if the facilities are not accessible.</p>

The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;(b)&nbsp; If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NICHD-18-018 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation/contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 811219 and the business size standard is $20.5m. However, this solicitation is not set aside for small business. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intend to procure on a sole source basis with Siemens Industry, Inc. - 6435 Virginia Manor Road - Beltsville, MD a one year (Period of Performance dates 3/1/18-2/28/19) preventative maintenance agreement for remote monitoring services of equipment/components and software services (in a scientific environment) for the animal facilities (Bldgs. 6B and across the NIH campus) and all aquatic facilities across the NIH main campus in Bethesda, MD. Equipment and software to be maintained and monitored: <br />Equipment: Quantity: Serial/MDL<br />Modems 4 EACH 3061<br />Apogee Ethernet Modules 2 EACH 1156<br />PXC Compact 1 EACH 3213<br />Mechanical Equipment Controllers (MEC) 6 EACH 3528 <br />MEC Point Blocks 5 EACH 3529<br />Apogee Software 1 EACH 3516<br />Uninterruptable Power Supplies 5 EACH 9901<br />Local User Interfaces Panels 1 EACH 9902 <br />Services to Include (not limited to)<br />The software services to include:<br />(1) Annual software updates<br />(2) Annual documentation updates<br />(3) Graphics creation<br />(4) Graphics backup<br />(5) Field Panel Database/System File Backup<br />(6) Control Loop Evaluation and Tuning<br />(7) Software Consultation
<p>The System Performance Services to include:<br />(1) On-line troubleshooting<br />(2) Operator support<br />(3) System Preventive Maintenance<br />(4) Corrective Maintenance and Component Replacement<br />(5) Account Management</p>
<p>Emergency Service Options to include:<br />(1) Response Window <br />(2) On-Line Response<br />(3) On-Site Response</p>
<p>Documentation and Quality Assurance to include:<br />(1) Documentation of Service Provided<br />(2) Quality Assurance Program</p>
<p>Remote Monitoring<br />Siemens Service:<br />Siemens proprietary Software - Siemens is the sole manufacturer and servicer for the Siemens APOGEE software.<br />See Attached for detailed service coverage.<br />This service/maintenance agreement is needed from Siemens Industry because Siemens manufactured and installed all equipment and software in the 6B facilities and aquatic facilities across the National Institutes of Health (NIH) campus. This is necessary for the monitoring and functions for all aspects of the aquatic systems. This includes but not limited to water quality, pump function, dosing modes and temperature. All these factors maintain the health and environment of the species housed in the aquatic facilities. Therefore, it is critical that the services, etc being proposed must be able to adequately work/function with the existing equipment's and software, etc. Any change in these factors without proper knowledge and information will cause animal death and loss of research. <br />The emergency remote alarm monitoring will allow remote monitoring from the Siemens service for many hours including 24 hours on weekends and holidays. Remote monitoring is necessary for any emergency alarms that are associated with the aquatic systems during the hours where husbandry staff is not on campus. These alarms will be passed onto the aquatic staff and inform them of any harmful or threatening situations that could compromise the health of the aquatic research animals. Without this monitoring, the staff would have no way to know if any system was malfunctioning or any water quality parameter was out of range during the hours that staff is not on campus. Siemens is the manufacturer and sole service provider for the NICHD Siemens Aquatic APOGEE InfoCenter system at the NIH. Due to Siemens Apogee System's unique proprietary protocol, no other system can communicate with it. Siemens service/software is necessary to continue operating the existing program and to not suffer significant loss of animals and research. Also in order not to void the current warranties, Siemens must provide the needed service/maintenance agreement. Siemens is the only known authorized licensees US vendor that can provide the necessary replacement parts for the Apogee system hardware and software, upgrade to existing systems currently in place and has the expertise to repair this system.<br />The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of the 41 U.S.C. 253(c) (1), FAR 6.302. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.

<DESC><p><br /><br />S/SVT INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>JANUARY 20, 2018: We are monitoring the Congressional efforts closely today and will make a decision&nbsp;regarding the S/SVT Industry Day's status no later than&nbsp;Saturday night (01/20/2018)&nbsp;in order to provide our valued Industry partners time to change transportation and lodging reservations.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /><br />JANUARY 19, 2018: &nbsp;In the event of a Government shutdown, the S/SVT Industry Day, currently scheduled for January 22 &amp; 23, 2018 at Ft Leavenworth, Kansas, will be postponed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The current Continuing Resolution ends on January 19, 2018. If a new Continuing Resolution (or applicable appropriations act) is not signed, then the Government will likely shut down. If a shutdown occurs, the S/SVT Industry Day will be postponed to a later date.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the Government does shutdown, official notice of the Industry Day postponement will be provided via FBO; however, industry partners should regularly monitor news outlets to determine the status of a new Continuing Resolution (or applicable appropriations act).</strong></p>
<p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><strong>If a new Continuing Resolution (or applicable appropriations act) is signed before January 22, 2018, the S/SVT Industry day will occur as scheduled.</strong></span></p>
<p><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The U.S. Army Combined Arms Center for Training (CAC-T), Ft. Leavenworth, Kansas, will conduct an Industry Day on 22-23 January 2018 at the Frontier Conference Center on Ft Leavenworth, Kansas. The objective of this event is to communicate the S/SVT concept to Industry partners and Academia, and to address any questions or concerns interested parties may have regarding the effort.</p>
<p>Solider/Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT)&nbsp;reflects a combination of the Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT)&nbsp;and the Solider Virtual Trainer (SVT) efforts.&nbsp; If you have previously registered for the SiVT Industry Day, your registration is still valid and you do not need to register again. <br /><br /><strong>The purpose of Special Notice Amendment 01, dated&nbsp;January 17, 2018, is to provide the S/SVT Statement of Need to&nbsp;all interested parties.&nbsp; The document has been included as an attachment to this notice.<br /><br />Industry Day attendees are strongly encouraged to review the document and prepare any questions prior to the Industry Day event on 22-23 January 2017.<br /></strong><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND/PURPOSE:</span></p>
<p><br />The Army lacks an integrated Soldier and Squad simulation training capability for close combat, multi-domain battle in diverse complex operational environments. Moreover, there are virtual training shortfalls for qualification and certification of precision targeting with precision munitions, replication and integration of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and counter UAS operations, as well as the conduct and clearance of fires and airspace de-confliction. The Army seeks to develop the next generation virtual training capability through the S/SVT effort to fill those gaps and advance weapons skill development, call for fire, and use of force training.</p>
<p>To address the gaps identified above, the Army/USMC requires a scalable, transportable, Soldier/squad close combat simulation trainer that provides:</p>
<p>- Realistic and tailorable OE and Acceptable equipment form, fit, and function that allows squad dismounted operations<br />- Provides training at the Point of Need<br />- Scalable from the individual to squad <br />- Software engine agnostic <br />- Intelligent tutor that captures and builds upon each repetition to accelerate skill acquisition<br />- Provides user feedback/AAR capability<br />- Soldier enabled capability that reduces overall setup time for increased training throughput</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDUSTRY DAY DETAILS:</span></p>
<p>Industry Day participation is available on a first come, first serve basis. Pre-registration is required (see information below on registration process, "How To Register"). Due to space limitations, no more than 2 representatives from each company may register to attend. Identification will be required at the time of check-in. There is no cost to attend the event; however, you must register to attend in advance.</p>
<p>Representatives interested in attending shall register by no later than 12:00 pm Central Standard Time (CST)&nbsp;on January 17, 2018. No substitutions are allowed. Due to capacity limitations, we are unable to accommodate walk-ins on the day of the event.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOW TO REGISTER</span>:</p>
<p>The Industry day public website will provide additional details, agendas, welcome information, and read ahead material. Check back periodically to obtain this information. The following link may be used to register online and to request a One-on-One session:</p>

The objective of this event is to communicate the S/SVT concept to Industry partners and Academia, and to address any questions or concerns interested parties may have regarding the effort.</p>
<p>Solider/Squad Virtual Trainer (S/SVT)&nbsp;reflects a combination of the Squad Immersive Virtual Trainer (SiVT)&nbsp;and the Solider Virtual Trainer (SVT) efforts.&nbsp; If you have previously registered for the SiVT Industry Day, your registration is still valid and you do not need to register again. <br /><br /><strong>The purpose of Special Notice Amendment 01, dated&nbsp;January 17, 2018, is to provide the S/SVT Statement of Need to&nbsp;all interested parties.&nbsp; The document has been included as an attachment to this notice.<br /><br />Industry Day attendees are strongly encouraged to review the document and prepare any questions prior to the Industry Day event on 22-23 January 2017.<br /></strong><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">BACKGROUND/PURPOSE:</span></p>
<p><br />The Army lacks an integrated Soldier and Squad simulation training capability for close combat, multi-domain battle in diverse complex operational environments. Moreover, there are virtual training shortfalls for qualification and certification of precision targeting with precision munitions, replication and integration of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and counter UAS operations, as well as the conduct and clearance of fires and airspace de-confliction. The Army seeks to develop the next generation virtual training capability through the S/SVT effort to fill those gaps and advance weapons skill development, call for fire, and use of force training.</p>
<p>To address the gaps identified above, the Army/USMC requires a scalable, transportable, Soldier/squad close combat simulation trainer that provides:</p>
<p>- Realistic and tailorable OE and Acceptable equipment form, fit, and function that allows squad dismounted operations<br />- Provides training at the Point of Need<br />- Scalable from the individual to squad <br />- Software engine agnostic <br />- Intelligent tutor that captures and builds upon each repetition to accelerate skill acquisition<br />- Provides user feedback/AAR capability<br />- Soldier enabled capability that reduces overall setup time for increased training throughput</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INDUSTRY DAY DETAILS:</span></p>
<p>Industry Day participation is available on a first come, first serve basis. Pre-registration is required (see information below on registration process, "How To Register"). Due to space limitations, no more than 2 representatives from each company may register to attend. Identification will be required at the time of check-in. There is no cost to attend the event; however, you must register to attend in advance.</p>
<p>Representatives interested in attending shall register by no later than 12:00 pm Central Standard Time (CST)&nbsp;on January 17, 2018. No substitutions are allowed. Due to capacity limitations, we are unable to accommodate walk-ins on the day of the event.</p>
