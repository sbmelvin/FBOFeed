Prior to receiving the solicitation package, contractors must comply with the following requirements excerpted from PBS Order PBS 3490.1:

Purpose.  This GSA order sets forth PBS?s policy on the dissemination of sensitive but unclassified (SBU) paper and electronic building information of GSA controlled space, including owned, leased, or delegated Federal facilities.  A major concern of GSA and the Federal Government is the safety and security of people and facilities under the charge and control of GSA.  This order outlines the PBS security procedures needed to reduce the risk that the material will be used for dangerous or illegal purposes.

Valid identification shall be the following:

1. A copy of a valid business license (if required by the jurisdiction where the business is incorporated or 
where the job is located). The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  If a business license is not required by the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and certified; and

2.Verification of a valid D-U-N-S Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

3. A Valid Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information [validation procedures being 
determined]; and

4. A signed certification from the authorized user acknowledging the requirement to safeguard the SBU
building information.  The certification shall include the definitions of ?reasonable care? as defined under this order. 


5. A Valid State driver?s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone 
verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.

Reasonable care is defined as:
(a) Limiting reproduction and/or dissemination of covered materials only to persons/parties related to the required work or otherwise authorized to receive such information;
(b) Making every possible effort that is reasonable and prudent to prevent unauthorized disclosure of this information; 
(c) Destroying documents no longer needed after completion of the work.  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or degaussing CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and defragmenting the computer hard drives.  Unsuccessful bidders/offerors shall make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all information/documentation received during the solicitation and/or appeals process upon contract award and completion of any appeals process;
(d) Performing due diligence to assure that all those who were in turn given SBU building information in the course of the work (such as subcontractors or suppliers) also adhere to these disposal requirements;
(e) The awardee continuing the efforts required above throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the awardee;
(f) Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

<DESC>This project is for the design and scaffolding of 12 sets of:  three 9-meter high systems scaffold towers - connected by two 36? long aluminum stage platforms with guardrails. Also included is the installation of such systems and training.  The scaffolding is to gain access to the tree canopy at a research experimental field site.  Scientists and technicians need direct physical access for observation, collection of samples and conduct of specific measurements and test. The project is located at the Harshaw Experimental Farm, North Central Research Station, 4398 Grace Lane, Harshaw WI.  The towers are to be constructed of systems scaffolding, with preengineered components. The scaffold and platforms will remain in place, out of doors, for several years.  Corrosion resistance and longevity of service will be important.  Design working load on planks is 750 lbs.  Approved engineering and assembly drawings will be required.  Initial assembly and erection of 2/3 of the scaffold & platform components will be required; Contractor will train government employees for the completion of the installation.  Training shall include on site, in person, training supplemented by workbooks and/or video training at a minimum. The scaffolding will be erected in amongst the existing trees.

<DESC>NA Defense Contracting Command Washington intends, on behalf of Army Research Institute, to negotiate a purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Joseph Zeidner and Associates.  Joseph Zeidner and Associates has specialized and working knowledge in the are a of differential assignment theory.  ARI recently convened an Expert Panel brought together to review the classification and Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) composites research undertaken by ARI over the last decade.  This review focuse d on the work done by Joseph Zeidner and Cecil Johnson and its application by ARI over this period.  In this procurement, Joseph Zeidner and Associates will repsond to the issues raised by the Expert Panel during the review.   Zeidner and Associates will p repare a Study Report completely describing the methodology and results in completing these five tasks:  Task 1.  Verify the need for range restriction corrections made in the calculation of AA composite regression weights by measuring the impacts on selec tion and classification efficiency (a) in the absence of corrections (b) with corrections made to the Army input population, and (c) with corrections made back to the youth population;	Task 2.  Compute validity coefficients for the nine interim composites using two methods:  (a) Calculate validities for 150 MOS samples, corrected for restriction in range, and aggregate to composite level.  (b) Utilize the regression weights previously provided to compute composite scores and the correlation of these scores with the criterion;  Task 3.  Within triple cross-validation design, conduct simulation experiment to compute unbiased estimates of mean predicted performance (MPP) for the nine interim and the 17 new AA composites, as derived from the seven-subtest ASVAB.   Also, provide separate estimates with hierarchical effects removed;  Task 4.  Extend the earlier fairness analyses to the 9 / 17 composites as derived from the seven-subtest ASVAB;  Task 5.  Follow the panels suggestions on the fairness issue:  (a) prov ide descriptive charts that show levels of expected performance within MOS at fixed test scores on the composites for the relevant comparison groups; (b) conduct more formal Cleary type analyses.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Vehicles Directorate (AFRL/VAK) solicits research proposals for Validation and Verification of Integrated and Adaptive Control System (VVIACS) Program.  The purpose of this program is to provide research and development to produce methodologies for affordable testing and certification of adaptive, and potentially intelligent, control systems performing safety critical tasks.  To ensure reliability of the Uninhabited Air Vehicle (UAV) system, techniques will need to be developed to adequately analyze and test flight critical on-board systems.  This program will provide analysis of current techniques for validation and verification of flight critical systems and assess new functional requirements for UAV and space applications, e.g., autonomy (unmanned operations), control adaptation, and reconfiguration, multi-vehicle coordinated control, develop new techniques enabling the validation and verification (V&V) and certification of emerging intelligent control concepts within time and cost of current techniques, and demonstrate V&V techniques and benefits on representative control functions.  Interested offerors may view and/or download the full PRDA solicitation by accessing the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps) homepage at http://www.eps.gov/. Direct questions to the Contracting point of contact identified in the announcement.

The work shall be conducted in phases to accommodate continued occupancy of the building and to accommodate phased relocation of existing building occupants. The building encompasses 1.3 million square feet, is fully occupied by the Social Security Administration personnel in the Woodlawn Complex, Woodlawn, MD. The contractor's personnel will be required to obtain security clearances prior to working on this project. The approximate duration of the contract is twenty-one (21) months.  The estimated cost range of this project is between $1,000,000.00 and $5,000,000.00.  This will be a firm fixed price contract and the procurement method will be a competitive negotiated Request for Proposal (RFP).  Source Selection Procedures as identified in FAR PART 15.3 will be utilized in the selection of a firm offering the best value to the Government in terms of price and technical merit and whose performance is expected to best meet stated Government requirements.  Accordingly, offerors will be evaluated based on technical merit with respect to demonstrated successful past performance, including the past performance of their subcontractors, qualified/experienced personnel and on their price proposals. All proposals are required to address each of the foregoing qualifications.  Omission of any of the criteria may render proposal nonresponsive, preventing the opportunity to submit a price proposal and gain further consideration for award.  The acquisition process shall consist of four phases: 1.) Receipt and evaluation of technical proposals utilizing selected criteria, the technical evaluation factors, Technical proposals submitted as a result of this advertisement shall not contain prices or pricing information.  [NOTE:  If you?d like to begin to format your pricing information at this point, you?d be that much further alone once GSA request pricing information. Study?s on all of the three buildings are available.]  2.) Develop an advisory short list based on technical qualifications/proposals of the most technically qualified firms.  GSA may make a final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability solely on the basis of the proposal as submitted.  GSA may proceed with the next step without requesting further information from any offeror; however, GSA may request additional information from offerors of proposals that it considers reasonably susceptible of being made acceptable, and may discuss proposal with their oferors.  In this stage, GSA will advise each respondent that participates in Phase 1, in writing, as to whether or not it will be invited to participate in Phase 3, or that it is unlikely to be a viable competitor.  GSA will advise the responding firms considered not to be viable competitors and the basis of GSA's opinion.  GSA will inform all respondents that not withstanding the advice provided by GSA in response to their submission in Phase 1, they may participate in Phase 3.  3.) Receipt and evaluation of initial price proposals based on 100% construction documents (A competitive range will then be developed by the Contracting Officer).  4.) Negotiations and evaluation of final offers.  Upon receipt and evaluation of all technical and price proposals, a formal selection of a firm will be made that offers the greatest value to the Government based on a combination of technical evaluation and price factors.  For this procurement, technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.  The technical evaluation factors for the evaluation process are:  Relevant Past Performance, Elevator Maintenance Plan, and Qualifications of Key Personnel.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 235950.  This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the pre-invitation notice.  Copies of this Solicitation (draft RFP) will be available on approximately March 18, 2002.

<DESC>The General Services Administration announces the procurement of a construction firm for a repair and alteration project at the Operations Building located at the Social Security Administration?s national headquarters in Woodlawn, Maryland.  The estimated cost range of this project is over one hundred million dollars ($100,000,000).  This announcement also constitutes the synopsis of the Request for Proposal.  

The Operations Building was designed in 1957 and constructed shortly thereafter.  Encompassing roughly 1.2 million square feet on 3 ? floors, the entire building, with minor exceptions, is to be completely renovated.  The work entails the removal of virtually all interior partitions and facades in a two-phase project over a 3-1/2 year period.  The building will be partially occupied during the work.  The phasing will occur by dividing the building into halves down a north-south axis.  The west half of the building will be renovated during phase 1, which will last 20 months, while the east half is occupied.  The east half of the building will be renovated during phase 2, which will last 16 months, while the west half is occupied.  The contractor shall build a 2-hour rated temporary wall that separates the construction area from the tenant occupied space.

The requirement of this project is for the construction firm to provide all supervision, labor, materials and equipment to perform, but not limited to, the demolition, replacement, and/or installation of the following:  Asbestos/Hazmat abatement, Light fixtures, Roof, Interior walls, Windows, Carpet, Facade, Doors, Plumbing, Paint, Restrooms, Cafeteria Equipment, Site work, Skylights, Building Automation System, UPS system, Lan/Wan/Telecom systems, Fire alarm system, HVAC systems, Fire sprinkler system, Ductwork, Security system, Electrical Systems, Masonry, Ceilings, Pre-Cast concrete panels.

This procurement is being conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  The NAICS code is 233320.  The Contractor will be chosen competitively utilizing formal source selection procedures in conjunction with the Best Value Continuum concept.  The Government anticipates the award, approximately December 30, 2002, of a firm fixed price contract to the firm offering the best value in terms of price and technical merit as a result of this effort.  For this procurement technical evaluation factors are more important than cost or price.

The acquisition process shall consist of 3 steps.  
Step 1:Offerors will be evaluated based on two technical factors: past performance and bonding capacity.  The criteria and directions for the submission of the step 1 technical proposal are available upon request.  After the evaluation is completed, all firms that responded to this pre solicitation notice will be notified as to their technical rating and an advisory short list will be developed.  Firms on the advisory short list will then be invited to participate in step number 2, however any firm that submitted a technical proposal will not be precluded at this stage. 
NOTE:  Contractors must submit a technical proposal during phase one of the procurement process to be considered for award.  Failure to submit a timely technical proposal will result in exclusion of a proposal from further consideration.

Step 2:A formal RFP, with 100% complete drawings and specifications, and additional technical factors will be issued to all firms on the advisory short list.  The approximate date for issuance of the RFP is on or after May 1, 2002.  The additional technical factors will be included with the RFP package.  Price and technical proposals are both required in this step.  A competitive range will be developed.  Oral presentations and interviews will be conducted with the firms in the competitive range.  Negotiations may also be conducted in this step, however it should be noted that a selection and award might be made without discussions.  

Step 3:Receipt and evaluation of final offers.  Upon evaluation of any and all revised technical and price proposals, the firm who offers the best overall value to the Government will be selected for award.  

To be included on the GSA source list, and to obtain a copy of the step 1 technical criteria stated above, please mail, fax or email your request to Shelia Watkins at GSA, Chesapeake Realty Services District, The Wanamaker Building, 100 Penn Square East, Room 614, Philadelphia, PA, 19107, shelia.Watkins@gsa.gov, fax 215-656-5838.

Reference solicitation number GS-03P-02-DXC-0013 for identification purposes.
The step 1 technical proposals are due April 5, 2002 at 3:00 P.M, submitted to the Office of Business and Public Affairs, 100 Penn Square East, Room 829, Philadelphia, PA  19107.

<CONTACT>James Bieschke, Contracting Officer, (630) 252-2120, james.bieschke@ch.doe.gov;David Hess, Contract Specialist, 630 252-2677, david.hess@ch.doe.gov
<DESC>MOX FUEL PROJECT - OPTION 1 The Chicago Operations Office of the Department of Energy plans to exercise Option 1 to Contract DE-AC02-99CH10888 for Mixed Oxide (MOX) Fuel Fabrication and Reactor Irradiation Services in support of the National Nuclear Security Administration's Fissile Material Disposition Program.  The goal of this element of the program is to safely disposition 34 metric tons of U.S. surplus weapons-grade plutonium.  To that end, DOE has pursued the transformation of plutonium oxide powder derived from the surplus plutonium to the spent fuel standard (making the plutonium as difficult to recover and as unattractive for use in weapons as the plutonium in existing commercial spent nuclear fuel). This requires both fuel fabrication and reactor irradiation services.  It has been DOE's preference that both of these services be coupled and integrated by a single entity.  On March 22, 1999, Contract Number DE-AC02-99CH10888 was awarded to the consortium Duke, COGEMA, Stone & Webster, LLC (DCS), currently located at 128 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC 28202, as a base contract with three options, for MOX Fuel Fabrication and Irradiation Services.  These services include the design, construction, licensing, operation and deactivation of the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF); performing fuel qualification and fuel design activities necessary to obtain NRC approval for the use of MOX fuel in commercial light water reactors (CLWR's); performing reactor core design, reactor facility modification design and modifications, and licensing activities required to permit the irradiation of MOX fuel elements in CLWR's; design and procurement of fresh MOX fuel transportation packages; and the managerial and technical integration of all activities. The consortium approach has maximized private sector participation and provides for the coordination of all services within the consortium.  The consortium approach also has encouraged traditional business relationships among fuel designers, fuel fabricators, reactor vendors, reactor operators, and architect-engineers, including retaining the long-standing relationship between utilities and their fuel fabricators.  Negotiations and contractual relationships have also been simplified by the consortium approach. The initial ("Base") contract is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract for facility design, license application, and fuel qualification activities. Specifically, the Base portion of the contract includes the following:  Design and initial licensing activities for the MFFF;  Fuel qualification activities, including fuel design activities;  Irradiation services activities, including reactor core design, the identification and design of required reactor facility modifications, and submittal of license amendment documentation;  Design of MOX Fresh Fuel Transportation Package and obtaining a Certificate of Compliance from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for the package;  Managerial and technical integration of all contract activities. The scope of Option 1 will include the following:  Construction management services to include procurement and management of all construction sub-contracts, procurement and installation of facility equipment, and Title III engineering;  Functional check-out and cold start-up of the MFFF;  Defense of required Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing applications for the MFFF and mission reactors;  Performing required facility modification's to the mission reactors;  Procurement of fresh MOX fuel assembly shipping packages;  Managerial and technical integration of all contract activities. The selection of DCS for award of the base contract and the three options was the result of a competitive selection process involving a source selection board.  The solicitation required prospective Offerors to provide an integrated technical approach to MOX fuel fabrication, qualification, irradiation, and transportation in a manner similar to standard practices in the commercial nuclear industry.  By their nature, each of these technical elements is inextricably tied to the others.  The source selection board determined that the technical approach proposed by DCS would result in the lowest cost and least risk method to meet the commitments of the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Program. The proposal submitted by DCS included the application of certain limited rights data, owed by the partner companies and subcontractors, in the performance of the contract statement of work.  Because the work products developed during the Base portion of the contract are integral to the performance of Option 1 activities, so are the limited rights data provided by the DCS partners and subcontractors integral to the performance of Option 1. Any alternative technical approach to perform the Option 1 statement of work would require DOE to duplicate a significant portion, if not all of the contract costs incurred to date for the implementation of an alternate technical approach. Therefore, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1 "Only one responsible source and no other supplies/services will satisfy agency requirements", it has been determined that DCS is the sole designer, licensee, and construction manager of the MFFF, defender of NRC licensing documents for the MFFF and mission reactors, constructor of modifications to mission reactors, and purchaser of fresh MOX fuel assembly shipping packages.  As such this option will be negotiated on a sole source basis with DCS.  It is anticipated that a performance based Cost Plus Incentive Fee Option with a period of performance from date of exercise through March 2007 will be awarded.  Performance will take place primarily in Charlotte, NC, Aiken, SC, and France.  Though this option will be negotiated on a sole source basis with DCS, all responsible sources who believe they can perform the efforts described herein may submit a proposal detailing their capabilities which will be considered by the agency. Such capability statements may be faxed to Mr. David Hess at (630) 252-5045.

<DESC>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-110 (A-110) provides public access under some circumstances to research data through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).  A-110 applies to new and competing continuation awards made after April 17, 2000, and applies to data that are (1) first produced in a project that is supported in whole or in part with Federal funds; and (2) cited publicly and officially by a Federal agency in support of an action that has the force and effect of law, i.e., regulations and administrative orders.

Requests made under OMB Circular A-110 differ from traditional requests made under the FOIA, because A-110 allows the public to request data collected by institutions of higher education, hospitals, and non-profit institutions that receive grants and other financial assistance provided by Federal agencies.  Such requests will still be made through the traditional FOIA channels.  However, most FOIA offices lack the scientific and technical expertise that is necessary to review the responsive data set and ensure that it has been redacted in accordance with A-110 and the FOIA.

The Contractor will primarily act as a liaison between the NIH FOIA Office and the NIH Grantee Institution in generating a redacted data set that is responsive to an A-110 request, and in handling fees associated with processing a request.  Once the FOIA Office receives a request, it will be forwarded to the Contractor for processing.  The Contractor will be responsible for contacting the Grantee Institution and obtaining a redacted copy of the responsive data set from the Grantee Institution.  The Grantee Institution will provide, along with the redacted data set, a written justification, detailing what information was redacted and why.  The Contractor will review the redacted data set for responsiveness, and to ensure that all personal identifiers and proprietary information were removed.  If necessary, the Contractor will travel to the Grantee Institution to perform this review, and will negotiate with the Grantee Institution to generate a redacted data set that is releasable under A-110 and the FOIA.

Further, the Contractor will be responsible for the collection and accounting of fees associated with processing a request.  The Contractor will obtain a cost estimate, to provide a redacted data set, from the Grantee Institution and will generate its own cost estimate.  The Contractor will receive a prepayment from the requestor, and will hold the monies in a non-interest-bearing account while the request is processed.  Once processing is complete but prior to the release of the redacted data, the Contractor shall collect any amount due or refund any amount owed to the requestor.  The Contractor shall also reimburse the Grantee Institution out of the fees held in the non-interest bearing account.  Any monies still remaining (after the Grantee Institution is reimbursed) shall be used to defray the costs, first to the Contractor and then to the NIH A-110 Service Center. 

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 514199 with a size standard of $6,000,000.  Request for Proposal (RFP) No. N02-CO-21024-22 will be available on or about March 25, 2002, and receipt of proposals will be due on or about April 29, 2002.

NCI plans to award one incrementally funded term contract with a three-year base period and with two-one year options on or before September 30, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>In August 1998 the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) competitively awarded through the GSA FSS Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to Software Performance Systems (SPS) for software development and maintenance support using the Cool:Gen development toolset.  SPS has developed, enhanced, and maintained the Revenue Accounting and Management System (RAM) to the present and has developed domain knowledge of the RAM system and corporate knowledge of the USPTO's business and procedures for collecting and processing both paper-based and electronic payment of fees.  The USPTO subsequently awarded an eleven (11) month sole source BPA to SPS beginning in October 2001 to complete development and maintenance activities begun under the original BPA.  The USPTO now intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with SPS a cost plus fixed fee contract for the acquisition of continued developmental support using the Cool:Gen toolset, on-going maintenance, and related transition activities to facilitate the USPTO's e-Government initiatives through the maintenance, development, and enhancement of the USPTO's mission-critical RAM system.  The period of performance will be for eighteen (18) months with an expected start on April 1, 2002 and continuing through September 30, 2003.  During GFY2003 the USPTO intends to commence RAM-related transition activities using other contracts.  The proposed contract action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  SPS is the only source with the fee processing and financial activities corporate knowledge and expertise necessary to complete the development, deployment and maintenance of mission-critical projects within the aggressive timeframe necessary to meet the USPTO's e-Government goals, as well as provide the necessary specialized knowledge for an effective and orderly transition to other contracts.  Unacceptable cost, schedule, and technical risks would be incurred if another contractor were selected for the RAM effort. Awarding these services to any other source would result in a cost duplication the USPTO is not in a financial position to bear, jeopardize large investments the USPTO has made in developing RAM, and endanger completing the USPTO's e-Government initiatives in a timely manner.  This is NOT a request for proposals, nor will one be made available.  However, concerns that respond must furnish detailed information describing capabilities to deliver the above services to:  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Office of Procurement, Box 17, Washington, DC  20231.  Questions may de directed to David A. Sibik at dave.sibik@uspto.gov.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This is a request for information (RFI).  The USAF Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Battlelab plans to conduct a concept demonstration of commercial/government off-the-shelf infrared (IR) sensor technology to provide instantaneous IR sensing and cuing from a UAV.  The UAV Battlelab plans to examine aspects of using scanning IR and staring IR sensors from a UAV, to detect and track enemy firing positions and flight path of launched munitions from Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and other air defense systems to aid in Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD).  Previous limitations included low sensitivity and limited range.  In this RFI, the Battlelab is seeking information about improved technology systems with increased sensitivity, longer range of detection, and immediate cuing of UAV and other platforms? sensors to improve target engagement.  Specifically, the UAV Battlelab is seeking information about IR sensor systems that can detect theater missiles and MANPADS (possibly artillery fire or smaller arms fire).  The system should conform to the power requirements available on board the UAV, should be of the minimum size and weight possible, and should provide the maximum sensitivity and range of detection possible.  The system should also interface with the UAV to cue on/off-board sensors for immediate visual observation; provide information to determine target coordinates; provide in-flight tracking of a missile/projectile and information to determine impact ellipse (ballistic projectiles).  Finally, since this system will reside in/on the UAV, it must function properly in the temperature, humidity, vibration, altitude, and other environmental factors encountered by military aircraft, and should conform to applicable sections of MIL-STD-810F.  Any previous demonstration information would also be beneficial.

Through this BAA, the Air Force is soliciting information concerning mature (IR) sensor technologies, which meet the requirements previously stated, to be used in a UAV Battlelab concept demonstration.  The primary selection criteria for all proposals will be the most practical system available to support the requirement.  All offerors are strongly encouraged to submit information supporting this request.  

Submission Information: 
Proposals may be submitted until COB EST, March 13, 2002.  Please submit to Mr. Bob Bal of Concurrent Technologies Corporation via email at balr@ctc.com or mail to 100 CTC Drive, Johnstown, PA 15904-1935.  Electronic submittals are strongly encouraged.  THE SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT CONCERNING THIS RFI IS MR. BOB BAL.  You may contact Mr. Bal with any questions you may have at (814) 269-6434.    

General Information Concerning This BAA:
This notice itself constitutes the BAA as per FAR 6.102(d) (2).  There shall be no formal RFP.  The Air Force reserves the right to select for award, any, part of, all, or none of the proposals received.  The Air Force may or may not purchase any of the systems submitted.  This BAA is an expression of interest only and does not commit the Air Force to pay any prototype costs related to this announcement.  Offerors are advised that only the Air Force UAV Battlelab is legally authorized to commit the Government to the obligation of funds.

<DESC>This announcement is a request for information. The Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center, San Diego (SSC San Diego), is seeking to improve the present performance and throughput of Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) systems, by seeking alternatives or enhancements to the current technology.  Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) technology passively measures emitters, and characterizes unique emitter signatures that can be used for friendly or enemy emitter identification and fingerprinting. SSC San Diego is seeking solutions to increase SEI throughput and performance, and intends to initiate a Foreign Comparative Test (FCT) to determine if improved capabilities exist, through a comparison with existing SEI systems. Vendors may be invited to participate at their own cost at this comparative test. All candidate systems must be capable of producing SEI signature data that conforms to the National standard, in addition to other processing techniques. Respondents should provide as a minimum: (1) physical and functional description (i.e. design drawings) of the item being offered (size and external description); (2) performance description and specifications of the item (hardware, software), and any anticipated changes (3) if possible, include present cost of item, and anticipated cost in the future with further development, and any anticipated changes; (4) if not yet in production, provide the development status and anticipated schedule for completion. Candidate systems must be mature, available for procurement, and demonstrated to be operationally suitable in physical form factor and level of automation. They should also be available for initial fielding no later than one year from test date. Form factor must not be larger than two 3U VME cards and must be survivable in an aircraft environment.  Form Factor however, does not necessarily have to be constrained to a VME bus structure. The requested information is for planning purposes, and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued.  However, SSC San Diego will utilize the information for technical and acquisition planning. It is recognized that cost information provided by the contractor is a preliminary estimate for planning purposes; the contractor will not be bound to these estimates. Subsequent acquisitions may follow in the ways to best meet SSC San Diego needs. The government invites comments related to possible purchase or acquisition strategies. If there is a GSA or other contract vehicle already available for the technology being proposed, please include this information in the response. All data received in response to this RFI marked or designated as corporate, or proprietary will be fully protected from release outside the government. It is not the intent of SSC San Diego to reimburse providers for the cost of submitting information in response to this RFI.  Please direct any questions to the SSC San Diego POC, Mr. Terry Metz at e-mail metzv@spawar.navy.mil.  To be beneficial, interested parties should submit any applicable information by 20 March 2002, via electronic transmission by utilizing the ?Submit Company Info? link above.

DESC:  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS IS TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE OF POTENTIAL QUALIFIED COMMERCIAL STORAGE AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND THEIR SIZE CLASSIFICATIONS (HUBZONE 8(a), 8(a), HUBZONE, SMALL, SMALL DISADVANTAGED, NISH, BRAVO AND LARGE BUSINESS) RELATIVE TO NAICS CODE 493110.  This code may be accessed at www.census.gov/naics.  The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Farm Service Agency (FSA) is seeking a qualified source for a potential performance based commercial services contract to 1) receive and store commodities for multi-food shipments, 2) accept orders from entities via an internet based system, and 3) deliver the orders.

This Sources Sought Announcement is issued for the purpose of conducting market research and allowing commercial storage and distribution facilities, herein known as facility, to provide comments, suggestions, and questions about the proposed contract.  Additional information about our requirements, evaluation criteria, and how to submit proposals is provided at www.fsa.usda.gov/daco/pilotcontract.htm. 

All information submitted in response to this Sources Sought Announcement will be used for planning purposes only.  All information contained in the Sources Sought Announcement is preliminary, as well as subject to modification, and is in no way binding on the Government.  All information received will be considered as USDA develops the solicitation.  This is not a formal solicitation, but a request for interested parties to provide information.  NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS AND REQUESTS FOR SOLICITATION WILL BE IGNORED.  

FSA is seeking to establish and implement a performance-based commercial services contract within the southwest region of the United States with a facility to receive and store commodities purchased by USDA for a multifood shipments pilot program.  This region includes the following states: Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana and New Mexico.  These shipments are delivered to recipients of federally mandated commodity feeding programs, as well as victims of natural disasters.  The facility must be able to accept orders directly from these entities via an Internet based ordering, inventory, tracking and  monitoring system.  In addition, the facility will be responsible for logistics.  Logistics include rating, routing and transportation.  Delivery of these orders must be accomplished in full and less than truckload quantities, with a potential for dry, cooler and freezer in a single truck.  The facility will also be required to provide information to USDA on orders, inventory levels, and other operations related to the performance of the above functions.

Background Information: The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR), the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) and the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) are federally mandated food distribution programs.  Approximately 24 million pounds are delivered annually to the Food and Nutrition Service's Southwest Region in multifood shipments.  Multifood shipments are shipments containing a variety of commodities that can also have different temperature requirements. The multifood shipments for this Region go to approximately 28 different locations.  Some of the larger delivery locations for multi-food shipments are Ada,  Antlers,Okmulgee, Stroud, Tahlequah, and Watonga, OK and Dallas, TX.  Multifood shipments will include primarily FDPIR and CSFP, with occasional shipments to other programs, such as TEFAP.  The regulations for these programs may be found under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); FDPIR (7 CFR Part 253), CSFP (7 CFR Part 247) and TEFAP (7 CFR Part 251).  The CFR may be accessed at www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr.

FDPIR is a federal program that provides commodity foods to low income households, including the elderly living on Indian reservations, and to Native American families residing in designated areas near reservations.  Many Native Americans participate in the FDPIR as an alternative to the Food Stamp Program, usually because they do not have easy access to food stores. 

The CSFP supplements the diets of low income, pregnant and breastfeeding women, other new mothers up to one year postpartum, infants, children up to age six, and elderly people at least 60 years of age.  

TEFAP is a federal program that helps supplement the diets of low income Americans, including elderly people, by providing them with emergency food and nutrition assistance at no cost, usually through food banks, which, in turn, distribute the food to soup kitchens and food pantries that directly serve the public.

The commercial facility must have dry, cooler, and freezer capacity.  The minimum space requirements are: Dry  30,000 sq. ft., Cooler  6,000 sq. ft., Freezer 3,000 sq. ft., and Staging 10,000 sq. ft.  The facility must have the capability of maintaining a minimum two to three month supply of product averaging approximately 8.5 million pounds.  The average number of outbound shipments is approximately 70 truckloads per month. 

A facility operator must have experience in electronic commerce and Internet ordering capability and experience in providing distribution, pick and pack, and consolidation service, including assembly and staging of imminent scheduled shipments. Pick and pack capability is specialized for these programs in that multi-food shipments can include multiple commodities on each pallet, as well as dry, freezer and cooler commodities on the same truck. To participate, the facility operator must have either freight forwarder or common carrier authority from the Federal Highway Administration.  As part of obtaining appropriate operating authority, the facility operator will also be required to comply with, at a minimum, 49 CFR 366, Designation of Process Agent, and 49 CFR 387, Minimum Levels of Financial Responsibility for Motor Carriers. 

Written responses shall be mailed to the attention of Nancy Heintzelman, Chief, Procurement and Warehouse Branch, Dairy and Domestic Operations Division, Kansas City Commodity Office, Stop 8718, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, MO 64141-6205, Telephone: 816-926-3036.  These responses must be received no later than 30 days after publication of this notice.

<DESC>The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), under contract to the United States Customs Service, is seeking information from companies, educational institutions, research and development laboratories (public, and private), or other sources about commercially available equipment or near-commercial technologies that may be used for the detection of radioactive materials and/or special nuclear materials at border crossings and ports of entry.  We are interested in information on systems that would be usable for improved sensing of radioactive materials in railroad cars, shipping containers (all configurations), commercial vehicles of all sizes and shapes, and personal vehicles of all sizes and shapes.  Both high volume screening instruments, and detailed inspection instruments are of interest.  Specifically, we are looking for information regarding the expected technical capability and effectiveness of currently (or soon to be) available instrumentation with respect to expected threats given the speed, distance, shielding, etc. conditions that are typically found at border crossings and ports of entry.  Operational issues, specifically detection probabilities and false alarm probabilities for typical measurement conditions are of particular interest.  Other issues that might impact operations, such as required facility modifications, reliability and robustness, training requirements (must not require extensive user training), and health and safety issues are also of interest.

Participation does not imply any obligation on the part of the Government.  Proprietary information will be protected to the greatest extent provided by law.  Interested organizations/companies/institutions are encouraged to respond to this notice by providing a short written summary (no longer than ten pages) of their equipment capabilities, and the expected capability of their equipment for a specific measurement scenario (see items listed above).  Please send a copy of the summary by mail, fax, or e-mail to: Mr. Mark Panisko, M/S P8-20, PNNL, P. O. Box 999, Richland, WA 99352 by 22 March 2002.  FAX (509) 376-3868, or e-mail to mark.panisko@pnl.gov.

<SUBJECT>A -- Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Application of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO COMMERCIALIZE ITS INVENTION IN BIOMEDICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL APPLICATION OF ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY 

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking industrial partners to commercialize LLNL's patent technologies on biomedical and pharmaceutical applications of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS).  Broad patent positions are held on such applications in both US and Canada.  The patent technologies enable quantitative analysis of elemental composition of biomedical samples.  In particular, the technologies allow the detection of low level radioactive trace elements, such as 3H and 14C, as long as the trace element concentration is about one hundred times higher than the background.  With AMS, the patent technologies enable accurate study of metabolic kinetics of pharmaceutical compounds that can not be achieved by other commercially available detection methods.  More detailed information on the technology can be found in US patents 5,376,355, 5,366,721, and 5,209,919.  LLNL wants to license the technology to industrial partners that have demonstrated capability to deliver the technologies to the market.  With a suitable arrangement, LLNL intends to provide industrial partners corresponding technologies such as complete sample characterization, sample preparation, and data acquisition and logging systems.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in commercializing LLNL's Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Application of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry should provide a written statement of interest including a commercialization plan and a description of corporate capabilities relevant to commercializing the technology.  Written responses should be directed to:

	Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO02-004/291.

Please provide your written statement within forty-five (45) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in LLNL's Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Application of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry
