<DESC>Title:  Supply, Delivery and Installation of a Tate Access Floor System

NOTICE OF INTENT TO ISSUE A PURCHASE ORDER.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Health Effects Laboratory Division (HELD), Engineering and Control Technology Branch (ECTB), 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, hereby announces its intent to issue a purchase order to  Compu-Site Technologies, Inc. for the supply, delivery and installation of a Tate Access Floor System for the expansion of an existing laboratory with custom flooring required for an optical motion capture system mated with moveable force plates within the floor.   The case aluminum floor panels are fabricated with more accurate dimensional tolerance than concrete filled alternatives; the latter are not acceptable for the precision needed in this laboratory.  The floor tiles are ductile, and can be mounted in a monolithic installation that prevents clipping when floor panels are moved.  The floor tile can also be buffed to eliminate reflections that interfere with the optical motion capture system.  

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the  Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement and pricing information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward the capability statement and pricing information to Rebecca Mullenax, Purchasing Agent, Reference 000HCCCE-2011-99518, Centers for Disease Control, NIOSH, ATTN:  Rebecca Mullenax, MS:  GD, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505.  All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to an award of a federal contract.  The website is:  www.ccr.gov.

The Government will review any/all capabilities statements and pricing information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide this requirement.  Information received in response to this announcement will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), negotiations will be conducted with  Compu-Site Technologies, Inc,  100 Rosslyn Road, Carnegie, PA 15106-1037, as the only source and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

Offerors are encouraged to complete an Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) as soon as possible since this requirement will be appearing in solicitations in the near future. The ORCA can be found at </span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'">http://orca.bpn.gov<span style="COLOR: #000066">.

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</span></p>

Screening Information Request DTFAWA-11-R-ETASS, Amendment No. 0003 addresses Section L.12 Acquisition Milestone Schedule.  
On 4 January 2011 the FAA released Screening Information Request DTFAWA-11-R-ETASS for En Route Technical Assistance Support Services. Per Section L.12, an acquisition milestone schedule was provided for information purposes only and was subject to change.  The schedule contained projected dates when Phase I down selection would be completed and when Phase II proposals would be received from selected offerors. On 22 February 2011 you submitted Phase 1 proposals and evaluation began.  
In parallel to the evaluation, in keeping with published announcements regarding FAA commitment to fiscal responsibility, the FAA performed an assessment to streamline functions as well as realign organizations to ensure that services are delivered as effectively and efficiently as possible.  This acquisition; as well as other ongoing activities in the FAA were examined to ensure that conduct of the ETASS acquisition as well as administration of any resultant contract(s) would be performed in the most efficient manner possible.  
The acquisition is still in process. Phase I down selection is anticipated in the near future. We appreciate your patience.  
Notification of the Phase I results will be made by letter to offerors who participated in Phase 1.  Only those offerors selected in Phase 1 will be eligible to participate in Phase 2 of the acquisition.  This Amendment No. 0003 in no way reopens the acquisition.

This is a Market Survey for the repair of the FLIR Ranger HRC-U cameras used on the Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Fixed Tower Surveillance Program, in accordance with the attached draft statement of work The responses to this market survey will be used for informational Purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will NOT pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendor's expense.

At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated for this effort is 811219:  Other electronic and precision equipment repair and maintenance with a size standard of $19.0 Million.   
Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable.
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:

<ARCHDATE>08132012
<CONTACT>Dr. Dennis Polla, Email dni-iarpa-baa-11-09@ugov.gov
<DESC>SYNOPSIS:<br />The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) will host a Proposers' Day Conference for the Trusted Integrated Chips (TIC) Program on July 27, 2011 in anticipation of the release of a new solicitation in support of the program. The Conference will be held from 8:30 am to 3:30 pm in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. The purpose of the conference will be to provide information on the TIC Program, to address questions from potential proposers, and to provide a forum for potential proposers to present their capabilities for teaming opportunities.
<p>This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and planning purposes. The Proposers' Day Conference does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts. Conference attendance is voluntary and is not required to propose to future solicitations (if any) associated with this program.</p>
<p>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND GOALS:<br />Recent developments in the semiconductor industry show tremendous opportunity for the realization of integrated circuits and systems-on-a-chip derived from state-of-the art foundry processes.  The ability of semiconductor foundries to realize multiple types of integrated circuits, MEMS, and other More-Than-Moore capabilities will likely continue in the future.  In particular, such foundry processes are not only demonstrating exceptionally high performance in several technology areas, but also demonstrating low-cost, fast turn-around time, and high yield.  In addition to maintaining our supply and access to integrated circuits derived from the U.S. Trusted Foundry, it is important for both the Intelligence Community and other government agencies to have access to other state-of-the art manufacturing capabilities derived from world foundries with assurance that such chips are safe and secure without malicious circuitry or reliability concerns.  In addition, the protection of design intent and systems performance is an important goal to be realized in TIC.</p>
<p>The TIC Program aims to develop new approaches to chip fabrication where security and intellectual property concerns would otherwise prohibit the use of off-shore manufacturing foundries.  Specifically, TIC seeks to address secure foundry manufacturing of chips in several ways:</p>
<p>1)	Development of split-manufacturing processes in which a Front-End-of Line (FEOL) process defines transistor building blocks up to the point of the first or second metallization followed by a Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) process in which remaining metallizations are carried out in secure trusted facilities in the U.S.  Initially, the logistics and compatibility of using more than one fabrication facility at the 130 nm node will be of concern.</p>
<p>2)	Chip obfuscation methods whereby the intent of digital and analog functions and their associated building blocks are disguised in their function within the FEOL process.</p>
<p>3)	New verification methods that ensure that no malicious circuitry has been added during fabrication.  New ideas that are different from those being explored in other federal research programs, such as DARPA's TRUST and IRIS programs, are encouraged.</p>
<p>4)	New approaches to 3-D fabrication at significant semiconductor manufacturing nodes.  This includes new transistor/circuit designs and creative stacking methods such as those which may be required for integrated MEMS and III-V-on-Si chips.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that the TIC Program will logically scale its capabilities over a four year period having started with a core 130 nm-node capability and subsequently moving toward a 22 nm capability at the end of a four year period.  It is expected that methodologies to be demonstrated will define both high-performance integrated circuits and integrated systems such as MEMS over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>If successful, the TIC Program will have demonstrated a new ability for both the U.S. government and industry to realize safe and secure integrated chips having protected functional goals and proprietary circuit designs.  Collaborative efforts and teaming among potential performers will be strongly encouraged. It is anticipated that teams will be multidisciplinary with capabilities including: circuit design, chip manufacturing, and characterization.</p>
<p>IARPA anticipates that universities and companies from around the world will participate in this program.</p>
<p><br />REGISTRATION INFORMATION<br />Attendees must register no later than 5:00pm Eastern July 11, 2011 at https://conference.brtrc.com/tic_pd/ . &nbsp;     Directions to the conference facility and other materials will be available on that website. No walk-in registrations will be allowed.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, attendance will be limited to the first 140 registrants and to no more than 2 representatives per organization. All attendees will be required to present a government-issued photo identification to enter the conference. Non-US citizens will be required to submit a visit request form for Foreign Nationals at least 5 business days prior to the conference. The form and submission instructions can be found on the registration website.</p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />Attendees who wish to present organization capabilities for potential teaming opportunities may request to do so by sending an e-mail along with their presentation to dni-iarpa-baa-11-09@ugov.gov . Presentations will be limited to 10 minutes with a maximum of 5 slides (MS PowerPoint or PDF format). Opportunities to present will be limited by time and will therefore be on a first-to-ask basis. Deadline for requests is close of business (5:00pm Eastern) July 18, 2011. It is the presenter's responsibility to ensure that all materials briefed are appropriately marked and approved for presentation by their organization. The IARPA Point of Contact will review and approve all presentations.</p>
<p>This Proposers' Day is intended for participants who are eligible to compete on the anticipated BAA. Other Government Agencies, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) will not be eligible to submit proposals to the anticipated BAA nor participate as team members under proposals submitted by eligible entities. While such entities are not prohibited from attending the Proposers' Day, due to space limitations, preference will be given first to those organizations that are eligible to compete.</p>
<p>IARPA will not provide reimbursement for costs incurred to participate in this conference.</p>
<p>Questions concerning conference &amp; registration can be sent to dni-iarpa-events@ugov.gov.</p>
<p>Questions regarding the program can be sent to dni-iarpa-baa-11-09@ugov.gov.</p>

<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE ISSUED.  This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Part 15.  The Department of the Interior (DOI), Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE) intends to competitively award a cost type contract as a result of this notice.  There are no set aside restrictions.  The BOEMRE, Procurement Operations Branch, is the contracting office for this procurement and the resulting contract administration. All potential Offerors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database (www.ccr.gov) in order to receive Government awards.  The applicable NAICS Code is 541990, All Other Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. The estimated range for the award is between $460,000 and $498,000.00.  The period of performance of the resultant contract is expected to be 30 months from the date of award.ShoreZone mapping is a technique that will provide BOEMRE with the most comprehensive biological, physical, and geomorphologic data of the Beaufort and Chukchi coastal areas.  The BOEMRE analysts and decision makers will use shoreline mapping information for identifying high priority fish and wildlife habitats in National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Endangered Species Act (ESA) analyses and documentation for Lease Sales, Exploration Plan Proposals (EPP) and Development Plan Proposal (DPP) and in post-sale and post-exploration decision making.  The data will also provide an improved level of detail for use in: coastal contingency planning and oil spill response; monitoring habitat change in the event of context of future offshore oil, gas and mineral development activities and updating Environmental Sensitivity Indices (ESI). 
This study will collate and classify available coastal imagery for the Alaska North Slope from sources including:  1) 2001 NOAA imagery, collected in support of ESI mapping ~ (3,606 km of coastline, 2) 2001 BP imagery collected in support of spill response planning programs (825 km of coastline), 3) 2006 and 2009 USGS imagery collected in support of their coastal hazard assessment program (~5,000 km of coastline).  The video imagery will be interpreted and mapped (housed in ArcGIS and Geodatabase) into catalogs to provide a spatial framework for coastal habitat assessment on local and regional scales. This project will also provide ground surveys to get detailed physical and biological measurements throughout the various and often unique Chukchi and Beaufort coastal habitats. At least 25 stations will be established in each region with the potential for long term monitoring in the future. Sediment samples will be archived from each shore station for hydrocarbon analyses in the event of a local or regional oil spill. The Arctic ShoreZone Shore Stations will be added to the statewide database and made available online to the public in a spatially explicit and query able database. This data will aid our understanding of the differences between the coastal shorelines of these two regions and also increase our ability to detect future changes.
HOW TO COMPETE FOR THIS CONTRACT:  If you are interested in participating in this acquisition, please send your organizations name, point of contact, address, telephone and fax numbers, email address and DUNS Number via email to the Contract Specialist, Rebecca L. Kruse, at rebecca.kruse@boemre.gov at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, Herndon, VA by 9:00 a.m. Eastern Daylight Savings Time (EDST) July 22, 2011.

<CONTACT>Ryan Daniels

<a href="mailto:daniels.ryan@epa.gov">Ryan Daniels, Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>The US EPA/OAR/OAP Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD), under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Ventyx Energy, LLC. of Atlanta, GA for Ventyx Velocity Suite software licenses.  The license agreements will last for one-year.
The justification is as follows. Ventyx provides five services?EV Power, EV Fuels, EV Market-Ops, EV Energy Map and EV Weather? in the common Velocity Suite (VS) interface and toolset. VS allows for the analysis of energy industry fuel consumption, electricity production and market trends in both a web and desktop application.  CAMD utilized VS in support of the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule and will use it in the future for auditing and quality assurance of GHG emissions results.  CAMD also provides VS analyses to other EPA offices upon request and will continue to do so.  Market research indicates that although software products containing elements of VS are available, it would be difficult for CAMD to substitute another manufacturer?s application without costly and time-consuming customization, which would entail a significant and damaging disruption of services.
NO SOLICITATION OR REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered. Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the Contract Specialist at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<SUBJECT>BARDA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for Advanced Research and Development of Personal Protective Equipment, Ventilators, and Diagnostics
<SOLNBR>11-100-SOL-00021
<CONTACT>Flu-BAA@hhs.gov Flu-BAA@hhs.gov, Email Flu-BAA@hhs.gov
<DESC>BARDA is the lead federal agency for the advanced development of medical countermeasures (MCM) to protect the United States against public health emergency threats, including chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear agents, emerging infectious diseases, and pandemic influenza. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic exemplified the unpredictability and rapidity with which a novel influenza strain can impact the world's population. With a historic effort from both government and industry partners, vaccines were developed and available to the public six months after the initial outbreak. Despite high infection rates, the 2009 H1N1 virus was only mildly pathogenic, with relatively low rates of accompanying morbidity and mortality in the overall population. However, it is possible that future pandemics will feature morbidity and mortality rates comparable with historically more severe pandemics such as 1918 and 1957. The ever-present and ever-evolving threat of pandemic influenza presents a compelling need to optimize available medical countermeasures and develop entirely new modalities for prevention and treatment of influenza disease. This BAA will support advanced development activities to improve personal protective equipment, ventilators, clinical influenza test systems and diagnostic tools.
<p>The Pandemic and All Hazard Preparedness Act directs BARDA to promote (i) innovations in technologies that may assist MCM advanced research and development, (ii) research and development of tools, devices, and technologies, and (iii) research to promote strategic initiatives, such as rapid diagnostics, broad spectrum antimicrobials, and vaccine manufacturing technologies. The priorities of the BARDA Influenza Division are closely aligned with the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza (Nov, 2005), the National Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan (May, 2005), recommendations from the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise Review (Aug, 2010) and the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report on influenza vaccines manufacturing (Aug, 2010). The HHS Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise Review emphasizes the need to improve medical countermeasure technologies and move towards a "nimble, flexible capacity to produce MCMs rapidly in the face of any attack or threat".</p>
<p><br />The purpose of this BAA is to solicit proposals that focus on one or more of the following solicited areas of interest.</p>
<p>Development Areas of Interest:<br />&bull; Personal Protective Equipment and Full-Featured Continuous Ventilators for Influenza Infection &amp; All-Hazards<br />&bull; Clinical Influenza Test Systems and Diagnostic Tools</p>
<p>The Government intends to have a full &amp; open competition for this requirement in the form of a BAA, which is anticipated to be issued on June 21, 2011. The Government expects to make one or more awards, subject to the availability of funds, over the period of one year.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Project Description:
The Center for Substance Abuse Prevention, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , Department of Health and Human Services contemplates awarding a one year cost reimbursement contract with four option years entitled Native American Center for Excellence (NACE)-Prevention Technical Assistance Reference No. 277-10-0343.

The focus of this contract is to continue to support SAMHSAs SPF by meeting the Framework Essentials, rely on and recognize the important role that Tribal Nations and communities play in coordinating prevention funding, establishing and implementing policies and evidence-based programs, strategic planning, and developing infrastructure. NACE will support the Native American Tribes and Tribal Organizations and provide technical assistance to these communities in developing and implementing their plans to address substance abuse prevention and related disorders in Native Americans. NACE will utilize the latest knowledge of risk and protective factors and promote science and evidence-based practices to enable accountability and results.  Based on lessons learned from the original contract, the Center will continue to collaborate with SAMHSAs Center for the Application of Prevention Technologies (CAPT) and CSAPs Service-to-Science Initiative (STS) to emphasize STS approaches that include bridging local practices with science through culturally appropriate evaluators, client participation in STS academies and follow-on training and technical assistance (TTA). Furthermore, NACE will continue to leverage public and private resources through partnerships to achieve long-term goals. The Center will have an Expert Panel that will continue to develop and sustain these partnerships.

<DESC>The US Army Tank and Automotive Research, Development, and Engineering Center (TARDEC) requests information on existing full vehicle blast mitigation capabilities currently available to protect Light Tactical Vehicle occupants from Objective (O) M ATV level or Threshold (T) M-ATV level* underbody threats.  The most important technical considerations will focus on existing full vehicle level blast mitigating systems (as opposed to individual systems), which may include but are not limited to, underbody shaping, cab stiffness, energy absorbing interior crew floor, blast mitigating seats, and any other existing mitigating technologies.  This RFI is exclusively interested in existing full vehicle designs that are available to start comparative testing by 25 July 2011.  The government intends to enter into multiple appropriate Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) to quantify the effectiveness of existing vehicle level blast mitigation strategies and for compilation of data and comparison of approaches.  Blast mitigation strategies submitted will be compared with respect to the level of mitigation of occupant injuries as rated against the Head Injury Criteria (HIC), Dynamic Response Index (DRI), Revised Tibia Index (RTI), and blunt trauma injury criteria.  The overall program objective is to gain knowledge for comparative analysis of blast injury mitigation for vehicle level strategies, for potential consideration in current and future programs.  <br><br>*As Amended (A00002)

<DESC>The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research Development and Engineering Center, in support of Product Manager Soldier Clothing and Individual Equipment, is conducting a market research investigation for waterproof mountain combat boots. The goal of this effort is to indentify firms with capabilities to provide/design/develop boots for use by the combat soldier in rugged mountainous terrains and conditions. Interest is in readily available product(s). The mountain combat boots must be capable of meeting critical technical and uniform requirements as follows: 1) durable, hiking-style mountain boot that reduces shock impact while enhancing stability and support to the ankle. These boots, though stiffer and slightly heavier than traditional combat boots, are specially constructed to support movement and stabilize the foot and the ankle over more rugged terrain. 2) Provides for maximum breathability and waterproof characteristics in wet conditions. 3) Outsoles that provide propulsion and torsional support while allow for breaking and stability even as moving down an unstable decline. 4) Able to keep trail debris out of boot while maneuvering. 5) Designed to reduce pressure points and discomfort during descents on uneven, rugged terrain. 6) Prevents blistering during extended use. 7) Neutral color [such as olive]. 8) Provide for quick break-in. 9) Stiff-soled with tread that grips rocky terrain and loose, however flexible enough to remain comfortable for long periods of activity. Interested sources must, within ten (10) days following the publication of this synopsis, respond with information on their current product(s) and how they are made or could be modified to address the U.S. Army requirement. Interested sources shall include detailed information regarding their firm's experience, personnel, facilities and domestic production capabilities, independent laboratory test results, and relevant company background/experience, and product sample if available. If a firm chooses to submit a sample, no payment will be made by the government for such sample. Firms should provide pricing for currently available products. Firms responding shall clearly indicate whether or not they are a small business. This notice is for market research only. Responses to this notice are to be sent to Mr. Benjamin Cooper, U.S. Army NSRDEC, RDNS-WPW-C, D-323, Natick, MA 01760-5019. This is not a request for quotations. No solicitation document exists. The information received under this announcement will not be used to purchase items but may be used to develop acquisition strategy, Product Descriptions, specifications, and/or for internal review and evaluation.

<DESC>LKMD is a small, modular, unattended tactical ground sensor-based early warning system providing early detection and warning of intrusions. LKMD provides enhanced force effectiveness and situational awareness during all types of combat operations or missions. LKMD further enhances force protection by operating as a tactical stand-alone system, a supplemental device for use with other force protection and physical security systems or as part of an integrated layered situational awareness concept. LKMD provides programmable responses of illumination and/or sound, resulting in increased operational reaction time for individuals, teams, squads or platoons. Capable of being programmed and placed into operation quickly, allows the soldier to remotely program response configurations,is quickly recoverable. The sensor provides a pre-programmed response of audible/silent alarms and sends data to the hand-held remote control, notifying the operator of a detected target. Upon detection of a target entering the specified area, it activates the modules providing a pre-programmed illumination response.<br>

BACKGROUND		

The mission of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is to help the agency develop and maintain a healthy and productive workforce.  Periodically, personal problems, health concerns, and professional challenges arise that can impact staff performance.  The FDA EAP is a comprehensive program that can provide employees with the support, tools, and resources they need to manage through difficult times and remain productive on the job.  

The EAP is also a powerful resource for organizational leaders.  EAP professionals provide information, expert advice, and coaching to help managers respond effectively to employee and organizational concerns  such as workplace conflict, conduct issues, and performance concerns.  

With more than three decades of Federal crisis response experience, the FDA EAP is able to provide rapid response during and after adverse events such as violent workplace incidents, reorganizations, deaths of co-workers, or disasters  natural or manmade.  With a specialized crisis response team and a vast national network, the EAPs goal is to minimize the potential impact of a traumatic event by helping to return the situation to normal as quickly as possible.  


SCOPE

The EAP Services to be delivered are workplace-based behavioral health services designed to help maintain and improve employee productivity and to help employees address the full range of personal problems.

<DESC>This Sources Sought Notice (SS) is for information and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).
<p>The purpose of this SS is to identify qualified small business concerns [including Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB] that are interested in and capable of providing the below spinning disc confocal system.</p>
<p>The NHLBI does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted. As a result of this Sources Sought notice, the NHLBI may issue a Request for Quote (RFQ).</p>
<p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. However, should such a requirement materialize, no basis for claims against NHLBI shall arise as a result of a response to this Sources Sought notice or the NHLBI's use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.</p>
<p>The NHLBI is seeking capability statements from all eligible small business concerns [particularly Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB) and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)] under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 334516 with a size standard 500 employees.</p>
<p>Based on the responses received from this SOURCES SOUGHT announcement, the proposed acquisition may be solicited as a Total Small Business Set-Aside. All eligible small business concerns responding to this Sources Sought Announcement must have the capabilities to provide <br />Services/supplies as below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:</p>
<p><br />The Center for Human Immunology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is involved in the study of characterizing normal and pathogenic human immunome. As part of these studies, the Government collects and process large volume and quantity of donor and patient blood samples for cellular and molecular assays. Therefore, there is a need to purchase various equipment listed and described below in order to further NIH research in clinical sample collection, cell biology, and molecular biology.</p>
<p>1. Tissue Culture Microscope, quantity 1 each<br />&bull; Advanced ergonomic design and features<br />&bull; Easy-to-use mouse-controlled imaging software<br />&bull; 3MP color digital camera<br />&bull; 12.1-inch LCD display (1024 x 768 pixels)<br />2. Mini Centrifuge with 2 rotors, 115-240v,quantity 2 each<br />3. Universal air/gas piping for Biological Safety Cabinets, quantity 5 each<br />4. Biological Safety Cabinets, quantity 5 each<br />&bull; The biosafety cabinet must be independently tested and certified to NSF/ANSI 49. <br />&bull; The cabinet must use SmartFlow<sup>TM</sup> technology, automatically adjusting the airflow speed without the use of a damper to ensure continuous safe working conditions, even without maintenance adjustments. <br />&bull; Unit shall have all metal plenums designed for easy removal at filter change. (Non-metal, fabric type plenums are not acceptable.) <br />&bull; In order to preserve safety to the user and the environment, the exhaust blower on the cabinet must continue operating when the supply blower stops working. If the exhaust blower should fail, the supply filter will also be turned off. <br />&bull; In order to alert the user to a restriction in airflow or compromised safety, the cabinet must use Digital Airflow Verification pressure sensors (rather than anemometers) to detect pressure drop across the supply and exhaust filters. Pressure sensors must be encased in order to protect the sensor from temperature, humidity and other environmental phenomena that can impact the sensor's performance. <br />&bull; The microprocessor must display the inflow and downflow air velocities in real-time on an LED display to ensure the user knows whether or not the cabinet is working under safe operating conditions. <br />&bull; The front window can be either an 8 or 10" sash opening and be made of laminated safety glass to ensure containment of potentially hazardous samples in the case of accidental glass breakage. <br />&bull; All interior and exterior parts must be smooth to ensure no risk of cuts to users or maintenance personnel. <br />&bull; The front of the cabinet must be angled 10&ordm; to help minimize glare on the window to the user, and to ensure that the user's posture is comfortable during a working session. Inadequate user ergonomics in a safety cabinet may lead to excessive fatigue, unsafe working habits and harmful consequences to user safety or product contamination. <br />&bull; The cabinet noise level must be less than 62 dB(A) for a 3 foot or 4 foot cabinet and less than 64 dB(A) for a 5 foot or 6 foot cabinet as measured in a sound proof room 12 inches in front of the cabinet and 15 inches above the work surface. Lower noise levels promote more comfortable and safer working habits of the user. <br />&bull; The microprocessor controller must be located on a slanted front panel so it is easy to see and reach from a seated working position in front of the cabinet. <br />&bull; The front window must use SmartClean<sup>TM</sup> to ensure it is accessible for cleaning without requiring the user to remove or support the window. <br />&bull; The sides shall be double walled construction under negative pressure allowing side access through the SmartPort for tubing and cables without compromising NSF-tested containment. <br />&bull; The biological safety cabinet must be capable of achieving current state-of-the-art in energy efficiency. A biological safety cabinet with 8 inch work aperture, with lights on and fan at operating speed should consume &lt;150W for a nominal 3 foot cabinet;&lt;180W for a nominal four foot cabinet; &lt;280W for a nominal 5 foot cabinet; or &lt;360W for a nominal six foot width cabinet. <br />&bull; The cabinet must have a Night-set-back mode, ensuring cabinet cleanliness and reduced energy consumption when the window is closed and the cabinet is non-operational. <br />&bull; In order to provide maximum effectiveness, efficiency and safety to laboratory personnel, an optional UV light must be programmable to allow for specific exposure times from 0 to 24 hours without continuous reprogramming. The automatic shut off feature on the UV light saves money on replacement of the bulbs.<br />5. Vacuum valve for universal piping for Biological Safety Cabinets, quantity 5 each<br />6. 23" Ergonomic Saddle Stool, quantity 5 each<br />7. Precision general-purpose water bath, quantity 2 each<br />8. 20 Cu. Ft. Refrigerator, quantity 1 each<br />&bull; Temperature range: 2&deg; to 7&deg;C <br />&bull; Manual defrost <br />&bull; Hydraulic thermostat on exterior eliminates interaction with stored materials <br />&bull; Aluminum evaporator coil <br />&bull; Magnetic vinyl gaskets for positive door seal <br />&bull; CFC-free insulation and coolant<br />&bull; Designed for safe cold storage of volatile materials <br />&bull; Meets OSHA and National Fire Protection Association safety requirements to keep your lab safe from potentially destructive explosions<br />&bull; Inside capacity of 20 cu. ft. (566L)<br />9. Flake ice maker, floor model, 33" x 24.25" x 24", quantity 1 each<br />10. Eppendorf Research Plus Pipettes, set of 6: 0.1-2.5, 0.5-10, 2-20, 10-100, 20-200 and 100-1000&micro;L,quantity 6 each<br />11. Cryo Storage Tank, quantity 1 each<br />&bull; 24" Tank<br />&bull; Display liquid level and digital temperature simultaneously.<br />&bull; Tanks include a temperature sleeve to assure the warmest temperature (under the lid) is at least -130C or colder in a vapor phase of 3" to 5" of liquid.<br />&bull; Microprocessor control provides 16 audible/visual alarm functions and easy programming to change/set liquid levels, alarm level trip points, plus a manual fill button for manually filling or defogging.<br />&bull; Remote alarm contacts for independent monitoring of low-level condition.<br />&bull; RS232 output for independent monitoring<br />&bull; Low tank profile and patented counterbalanced lid with 100% clearance.<br />&bull; Heavy-duty casters to provide mobility within the lab.<br />12. Square rack for cryo storage system, quantity 17 each<br />13. Phase platform risers for cryo storage system, quantity 1 each<br />14. Integrated SpeedVac System, quantity 1 each<br />&bull; A CFC-free refrigeration system<br />&bull; Fully automatic bleeder valve<br />&bull; Built-in radiant energy cover for faster solvent evaporation<br />&bull; Fully adjustable vacuum setting including Vacuum Level Control<br />&bull; Oil-free TEFLON&reg; coated vacuum pump and chamber<br />&bull; TEFLON&reg; coated bowl<br />&bull; Easy connect 4-liter wide-mouth solvent recovery flask<br />&bull; Vacuum ramping to prevent "sample bumping"<br />&bull; Integrated all-in-one cabinet configuration requiring no tubing connections<br />&bull; Easy-to-use digital display and control panel allows user to set run time, temperature, vacuum and heat time<br />&bull; Comprehensive selection of fixed angle rotors plus (2) two plate swing-out microtiter plate rotor<br />15.

<p><br />INSPECTION</p>
<p>The contractor shall establish a quality control system covering the equipment stated in this performance work statement (PWS). This system must include a method for identifying deficiencies in the quality of service performed, before the level of service becomes unacceptable, as well as specify the areas to be inspected on a scheduled and unscheduled basis. The contractor shall maintain a history file on all repairs/inspections conducted and must indicate any corrective action taken. The history file shall be the property of the Government and shall be maintained by the contractor and turned over to the Project Officer upon completion of the contract. The history file shall be checked by the Project Officer when payment requests are submitted to ensure timely completion.</p>
<p><br /><br />QUALITY ASSURANCE</p>
<p>Five methods of quality assurance evaluation will be used. One or any combination of methods may be used to evaluate the Contractor's performance for any given service requirement.</p>
<p>The Government retains all rights provided by the FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulations) clause entitled "Inspection of Services-Fixed Price" and any other inspection clause which may be specified in the contract.</p>
<p>The five methods are:</p>
<p>1. Random Sampling:<br /><br />Surveillance based on random sampling is designed to evaluate some part, but not all, of the contract requirement being monitored. This method, based on statistical theory, estimates the Contractor's overall level of performance for a given contract requirement. Using random sampling, any occurrence of a contract requirement is as likely to be evaluated as any other occurrence. Random sampling is based on Officer of Procurement Policy (OFPP) Pamphlet No. 4 (October, 1980).</p>
<p>2. Planned Sampling:</p>
<p>Evaluation by planned sampling, like evaluation by random sampling, is designed to inspect some part but not all of the contract requirements being monitored. Specific occurrences of contract requirements that are to be monitored are selected for evaluation prior to their scheduled accomplishment.</p>
<p>3. 100% Inspection:</p>
<p>One hundred percent inspection is that evaluation method that requires total, or 100%, inspection of a contract requirement.</p>
<p>4. Validated Complaints:</p>
<p>This method is based on customer awareness. Customers monitor the service provided by the Contractor. When there is a case of poor or non-performance, the CO or the COTR is notified. Upon notification, the COTR or designee will investigate the report and, if it is found to be valid, documents it.</p>
<p>5. Unscheduled Inspection:</p>
<p>Unscheduled inspection is, as the name implies, impromptu and unannounced on-site evaluation of contract performance by authorized Government personnel as designated by the PO/COTR. <br /><br />SAFETY PRECAUTIONS<br /><br />All systems, either mechanical or electrical, that must be deactivated before servicing, shall be rendered inoperable by whatever disconnect or shut-off means is provided. Each deactivated system shall be properly "tagged-out" to prevent accidental reactivation. The Contractor shall furnish "tag-out" procedures at the start of the performance period. The Government shall be responsible for removing the contents of any equipment and ensuring it is biologically safe.</p>
<p>TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE OF KEY CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide only trained and qualified journeyman mechanics with appropriate training and experience in inspecting, maintaining and repairing the types of equipment covered by this contract. Journeyman mechanics shall have a minimum of five years field experience on ultra-low freezers, freezers, refrigerators and ice makers. They shall also have knowledge of electronic and electrical controls, and field experience in refrigerant repair work of industrial type systems. Each mechanic shall have a universal certification as required by 40 CFR part 82, Subpart F, and the North Carolina Building Code.</p>
<p>SERVICING HOURS</p>
<p>1. Normal servicing shall be provided during NIEHS regular working hours of 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, excluding the Federal holidays (listed below).</p>
<p>Martin Luther King's Birthday Labor Day<br />New Year's Day Columbus Day<br />Washington's Birthday Veteran's Day<br />Memorial Day Thanksgiving Day<br />Independence Day Christmas Day</p>
<p>2. In emergency situations, the contractor shall be required, at the discretion of the Project Officer or designated personnel, to perform emergency services without additional cost to the Government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The objective of this RFI is to obtain capabilities statements, based upon the requirements outlined above, from all small businesses interested in this opportunity. Respondents should identify any information they consider to be sensitive or proprietary. Responses will assist the Government in determining whether to set-aside, restrict competition in some way or solicit offers from all responsible sources.

The OOI will construct a networked infrastructure of oceanic sensor systems to measure physical, chemical, geological, and biological variables in the ocean and seafloor.  Measurement of the noted optical characteristics is vital to our understanding of many of the crucial scientific questions to which the OOI can provide answers.</p>
<p>Ocean Leadership is seeking firms who are interested in submitting proposals for the FLOR, OPTAA, and /or SPKIR instruments.  The selected firm(s) will provide approximately 64 FLOR instruments across 5 different series, approximately 51 OPTAA instruments across 4 different series, and approximately 27 SPKIR instruments across 2 different series for deployment on fixed platforms at OOI arrays.</p>
<p>For FLOR instruments, Ocean Leadership may issue a single award combining all five (5) CLINs or up to five single-CLIN awards, one for each instrument series.  For OPTAA instruments, Ocean Leadership may issue a single award combining all four CLINs or up to four single-CLIN awards, one for each instrument series.  For SPKIR instruments, Ocean Leadership may issue a single award for both CLINs combined, or two single-CLIN awards, one for each instrument series.  Ocean Leadership will not make more than one award for any one series of Instrument.</p>
<p>Ocean Leadership is the only point of contact for this procurement.</p>
<p>Potential Offerors who intend to submit a proposal should plan on participating in an online informational Bidders' Conference (via WebEx) to be held on June 17, 2011.

<p>13.1 A one square foot grid with 100 equal squares will be placed on the pavement surface at random, pre-selected locations. The number of squares that contain rubber will then be counted. In order to pass the test, the number of squares containing rubber deposits shall not exceed 15 at each of the selected locations.</p>
<p>13.2 Each work area designated for rubber removal will be divided into four equal zones for the purpose of compliance testing. Within each zone, seven locations will be evaluated. Four of those locations will be located within 15' of the runway centerline. At least six of the locations selected for testing in each zone must meet the requirement specified above. Each zone will be evaluated independently. A zone not meeting the 85-percent removal requirement shall be re-cleaned by the Contractor at his expense.</p>
<p>13.3 Deposits of rubber are defined as any surface deposit that can be removed by digging or scratching the deposit with a pocket knife without damaging the pavement surface. Rubber stain is defined as material in the pavement surface micro texture that cannot be removed without damaging the pavement surface. Rubber stain is generally embedded in the surface of the pavement below the horizontal plane of the surface texture. The Contractor will not be required to remove rubber stain. However, note that rubber stain is different from rinse water stain as defined in Paragraph 12.2.3.</p>
<p>14. CLEANUP: The Contractor shall perform a complete cleanup of the work and equipment storage areas after the work is complete. The Contractor shall ensure that no broom bristles, stains, trash, or any other debris is left behind in these areas. However, the Contractor will not be required to remove the black rubber dust left behind on the surface.</p>
<p>15. BID SCHEDULE: The Contractor shall fill out the bid schedule (see below). The unit of measure shall be measured in Square Yards (SY). There are two line items required on the bid schedule: (1) cost to perform work at Luke AFB; and (2) cost to perform work at Gila Bend Auxiliary Field. These items shall include all costs associated with travel, motel, per diem, etc, and all other costs directly related to a complete rubber removal finished end product. Payment to the Contractor shall be in accordance with the bid schedule. The bid schedule price shall include the appropriate tax.</p>

<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation number is 11-223-SOL-00135. This is a 100% small business set-aside.<br /><br />This solicitation is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-52, May 31, 2011.</p>
<p>The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 332999- All Other Miscellaneous Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing; Small Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) requires the purchase of specific caging used to house various animal species within the small animal section of CBER and has indicated that Allentown Caging, Inc. items listed below will meet their needs. However, "or equal" quotes will be accepted and evaluated from all interested parties. The cages shall be equivalent to the salient characteristics described herein.<br /><br />Quotes shall be for all New Unused Equipment Only.<br /><br />Technical requirement:<br />Item #1 MS10196U36MVCD3.<br />36 Cage Micro-Vent Rack with 10x19x6 Cages with Automatic Watering:<br />Ventilated rack structure to house 36 mouse cage systems<br />Split Platforms for increased visibility and decreased weight<br />36 Polysulfone micro-barrier systems (152 Sq. Inches).<br />Stainless steel wire bar lids<br />Edstrom automatic watering system (valve integral to cage).<br />Watering system manifold includes combination online flush and manual flush features<br />Edstrom "Easy Lock" cage latching mechanism<br />Plate mounted casters with 5" phenolic wheels<br />Rear mounted vertical supply and exhaust plenums<br />Eco-Flo Hepa Filtered supply blower<br />Eco-Flo Hepa filtered exhaust blower<br />Stainless steel vertical flip-up cardholder<br />HEPA filtered air is delivered (50-70 Air Changes per Hour) to each individual housing<br />unit by the rack or wall mounted integrated HEPA filtering Bio-PAK delivering "clean"<br />air to the stainless steel delivery manifold system under positive pressure terminating<br />in individual cage air injector tubes. The "clean" air is then delivered to each cage by<br />means of a stainless steel cage mounted air diffuser. Exhaust air from each cage is<br />captured by a unique Patented "U" shaped negative pressure stainless steel channel<br />manifold encapsulating three sides of the micro-barrier filter cover flange area,<br />collected into a return air stainless steel manifold system and finally forced through a<br />HEPA filtered rack mounted integrated Exhaust Pak blower system and exhausted into<br />the room atmosphere. All four (4) inch supply and return plenums utilize sealed access<br />doors and drains for simplified cleaning and drainage after sanitization. Both vertical<br />supply and exhaust plenums will be mounted on the rear of the rack.</p>
<p>Rack assembly consists of seventy two (72) 18 gauge individual stainless steel split<br />platform supports mechanically locked to &frac34;" x &frac12;" rectangular 16 gauge internal tubular<br />uprights. The split platform design decreases rack overall weight and enhances<br />visibility within the cage. Each internal upright is heliarc welded to the external rack<br />frame that will be constructed of a 14 gauge 1" x 1" tubular base, uprights and upper<br />frame structure to insure strength.</p>
<p>The entire assembly shall be plate mounted on stainless steel Jarvis and Jarvis casters<br />(two with brakes), and 5" diameter phenolic wheels.</p>
<p>The micro-barrier assembly consists of a high temperature Polysulfone (300 Deg. F.)<br />10" x 19" x 6" mouse cage providing one hundred and fifty three (153) square inches of<br />floor space with air bullet and A-160 valve assembly, a sheet metal design wire bar lid,<br />a high temperature micro-barrier three (3) piece filter top, and a vertical 3" x 5"<br />stainless steel "flip up" data card holder. Each top shall consist of a lid design<br />incorporating an "X" bar filter media support system, a die cut polyester filter sheet 18<br />mils thick, and a high temperature perforated filter retaining device designed to "snap"<br />into the top of the micro-barrier lid and hold the filter media sheet in place.</p>
<p>The micro-barrier will not require screw-on plastic nut arrangement or other type of<br />fasteners for holding the filter in place.</p>
<p>AUTOMATIC WATERING SPECIFICATIONS<br />Drinking Valve<br />The A-160 series Shielded valve (located in the cage) permits the valve assembly and<br />air inlet diffuser to travel with the cage for sterilization. The drinking valve will be<br />compatible with hyper-chlorinated or acidified water and autoclavable to 300 degrees<br />F. 316 stainless steel. Silicone elastomer wetted parts, operation at 3-5 grams of<br />actuating force with a flow rate of 30ml/min.</p>
<p>Coupling Design Socket<br />316 stainless steel with silicone seal.<br />Base fitting mechanically joined to manifold piping</p>
<p>"Easy Connect Lock" -Release Mechanism<br />Materials: 316 series stainless steel<br />Automatic spring loaded release lock to detach cage and drinking valve for cage<br />removal "Hands Free" Positive engagement with front cage lock release.</p>
<p>Wetted Component Materials<br />316L stainless steel piping, fittings and drinking valves<br />0.5 inch diameter with 0.036 inch wall piping<br />O-ring slip type fittings<br />Silicone "O" ring material<br />316 stainless steel female plug<br />Drain/vent valves: 316L stainless steel with silicone O-ring seat</p>
<p>Construction:<br />Mechanical and welded fittings<br />Passivation and electro polishing after welding</p>
<p>Mechanical Operation<br />The Edstrom A-160 shielded valve with the coupling design Air/ Water Cup Assembly<br />shall be integrated into the micro-barrier cage system and travel with the cage<br />assembly once removed from the rack. The coupling design automated water valve<br />assembly shall be operated by an automatic, spring-loaded lock mechanism located to<br />the lower right of each individual micro-barrier cage system. Proper docking to the air<br />and water grommets shall be achieved by placing the micro-barrier housing system<br />within the channel or cage guide. This operation will automatically open the<br />lock/indicator mechanism (continually allowing both hands to secure the cage<br />assembly) permitting the barrier housing assembly to slide towards the air/water<br />connection systems.</p>
<p>Proper docking shall be achieved by gently sliding the barrier assembly to the rear of<br />the cage guide channel. Activation (air and/or watering) shall take place immediately<br />when the cage assembly stops its front to rear travel. Once in position, positive locking<br />shall be achieved automatically when the swing lock mechanism engages in the front<br />of the cage holding it secure to the air/water manifolds.</p>
<p>Visual Indicator<br />A visual positive lock indicator will determine proper activation of the air/water<br />assembly. This positive lock indicator shall be comprised of a red cage indicator tab<br />located on the swing lock mechanism.

In addition, the ventilated<br />racks reduce the amount of air-borne particulates into the Macro-Environment.</p>
<p>Micro-Vent Environmental Housing System for mice. Configuration: Single-faced,<br />seven (7) wide by ten (10) high for a total of seventy (70) complete Reduced Height<br />Micro-barrier housing units per rack.</p>
<p>Unit shall be equipped with an Edstrom Reverse "S" automatic watering system<br />utilizing the "Easy Connect " Inside the Cage A-160 series Shielded Valve (CD-3).</p>
<p>All components are to be autoclavable and cage washable. The Coupling Design<br />system provides an automatic "POSITIVE" lock mechanism to the air and water<br />grommet connection and displays a visual indication for proper cage docking position.<br />The watering system shall feature a combination "on line" rack flush QD system for<br />automated flushing of the manifold, and a ball valve and drain line so that the manifold<br />can be flushed manually.</p>
<p>AIR and RACK SYSTEMS SPECIFICATIONS<br />HEPA filtered air is delivered (50-70 Air Changes per Hour) to each individual housing<br />unit by the rack or wall mounted integrated HEPA filtering Bio-PAK delivering "clean"<br />air to the stainless steel delivery manifold system under positive pressure terminating<br />in individual cage air injector tubes. The "clean" air is then delivered to each cage by<br />means of a stainless steel cage mounted air diffuser. Exhaust air from each cage is<br />captured by a unique Patented "U" shaped negative pressure stainless steel channel<br />manifold encapsulating three sides of the micro-barrier filter cover flange area,<br />collected into a return air stainless steel manifold system and finally forced through a<br />HEPA filtered rack mounted integrated Exhaust Pak blower system and exhausted into<br />the room atmosphere. All four (4) inch supply and return plenums utilize sealed access<br />doors and drains for simplified cleaning and drainage after sanitization. Both vertical<br />supply and exhaust plenums will be mounted on the rear of the rack.</p>
<p>Rack assembly consists of seventy (70) 18 gauge individual stainless steel split<br />platform supports mechanically locked to &frac34;" x &frac12;" rectangular 16 gauge internal tubular<br />uprights. The split platform design decreases rack overall weight and enhances<br />visibility within the cage. Each internal upright is heliarc welded to the external rack<br />frame that will be constructed of a 14 gauge 1" x 1" tubular base, uprights and upper<br />frame structure to insure strength.</p>
<p>The entire assembly shall be plate mounted on stainless steel Jarvis and Jarvis casters<br />(two with brakes), and 5" diameter phenolic wheels.</p>
<p>The micro-barrier assembly consists of a high temperature Polysulfone (300 Deg. F.)<br />75 Sq. inch mouse cage providing seventy-five (75) square inches of floor space with<br />air bullet and A-160 valve assembly, a sheet metal design rear pocket wire bar lid, a<br />high temperature reduced height micro- three (3) piece filter top, and a vertical 3" x 5"<br />stainless steel "flip up" data card holder. Each top shall consist of a lid design<br />incorporating an "X" bar filter media support system, a die cut polyester filter sheet 18<br />mils thick, and a high temperature perforated filter retaining device designed to "snap"<br />into the top of the micro-barrier lid and hold the filter media sheet in place.</p>
<p>The micro-barrier will not require screw-on plastic nut arrangement or other type of<br />fasteners for holding the filter in place.</p>
<p>AUTOMATIC WATERING SPECIFICATIONS<br />Drinking Valve<br />The A-160 series Shielded valve (located in the cage) permits the valve assembly and<br />air inlet diffuser to travel with the cage for sterilization. The drinking valve will be<br />compatible with hyper-chlorinated or acidified water and autoclavable to 300 degrees F.<br />316 stainless steel<br />Silicone elastomer wetted parts<br />Operation at 3-5 grams of actuating force with a flow rate of 30ml/min.</p>
<p>Coupling Design Socket<br />316 stainless steel with silicone seal<br />Base fitting mechanically joined to manifold piping</p>
<p>"Easy Connect Lock" -Release Mechanism<br />Materials: 316 series stainless steel<br />Automatic spring loaded release lock to detach cage and drinking valve for cage<br />removal<br />"Hands Free" Positive engagement with front cage lock release</p>
<p>Wetted Component Materials<br />316L stainless steel piping, fittings and drinking valves<br />0.5 inch diameter with 0.036 inch wall piping<br />O-ring slip type fittings<br />Silicone "O" ring material<br />316 stainless steel female plug<br />Drain/vent valves: 316L stainless steel with silicone O-ring seat</p>
<p>Construction:<br />Mechanical and welded fittings<br />Passivation and electro polishing after welding</p>
<p>Mechanical Operation<br />The Edstrom A-160 shielded valve with the "Coupling Design" Air/ Water Cup<br />Assembly shall be integrated into the micro-barrier Cage System and travel with the<br />cage assembly once removed from the rack. The "Coupling Design" automated water<br />valve assembly shall be operated by an automatic, spring-loaded lock mechanism<br />located to the lower right of each individual micro-barrier Cage System. Proper docking<br />to the air and water grommets shall be achieved by placing the micro-barrier Housing<br />System within the channel or cage guide. This operation will automatically open the<br />lock/indicator mechanism (continually allowing both hands to secure the cage<br />assembly) permitting the BARRIER Housing assembly to slide towards the air/water<br />connection systems.</p>
<p>Proper docking shall be achieved by gently sliding the barrier cage assembly to the<br />rear of the cage guide channel. Activation (air and/or watering) shall take place<br />immediately when the cage assembly stops its front to rear travel. Once in position,<br />positive locking shall be achieved automatically when the swing lock mechanism<br />engages in the front of the cage holding it secure to the air/water manifolds.</p>
<p>Visual Indicator<br />A visual positive lock indicator will determine proper activation of the air/water<br />assembly. This positive lock indicator shall be comprised of a RED cage indicator tab<br />located on the swing lock mechanism. The indicator will protrude (to the right)<br />approximately 1/2" from a stainless steel housing mechanism when the cage is not<br />within the specified locking position of the air/water connection device. In order to<br />achieve and assure proper connection of the micro-barrier Housing System to the<br />air/water connection device, the RED indicator tab must be completely encased within<br />the stainless steel housing. Absence of any RED markings from the barrel of the<br />indicator tab shall indicate that the proper connection has been achieved. Location of<br />the indicator shall be directly above the lock arm on the right front side of each microbarrier Housing System.</p>
<p>Note: All watering components are to be manufactured by Edstrom Industries.<br />These components shall include water manifolds, male and female cage<br />connections systems, water valve, and cage lock assembly.</p>

[Procedures in FAR 13.106 are applicable to this procurement.  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award will be based on a combination of factors - a combination of price and past performance.  

 The quoter shall submit, as part of its quote, information on previously performed contracts or on-going contracts that are similar to the statement of work/item description in the solicitation performed for Federal, State or local Governments, and for commercial firms.
 Information shall be provided on either 1) all such contracts within the past three years, or 2) the last three such contracts performed, whichever is fewer, and shall be limited to the name and address of the organization for which the product was supplied and services were performed and the number (phone, fax or Internet) of a contact for each contract listed. The quoter should not describe past performance history in the quote. The information should include, however, discussion of any major problems encountered on the contracts listed and the corrective actions taken to resolve them. The information may also include a description of any quality awards earned by the quoter.  The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government.
  Quoters lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance.  However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.  The quoter should provide the information requested above for past performance evaluation, or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant directly related or similar past performance.  The assessment of the quoters past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the responder and other competitors to successfully meet the requirements of the RFQ.
  The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFQ.

<p>12. Description:</p>
<p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Parts 12.6 and 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number HSCG38-11-Q-200125 is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-52. The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336413. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. The US Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center intends to award a firm fixed price purchase order for the purchase of the following parts used on the Short Range Recovery (SRR) aircraft:</p>
<p>NSN: 1615-01-HS1-6468<br />P/N: 710E001<br />MAIN ROTOR BLADE CAN<br />QTY: 10 EA<br />MFG CC: 05259<br />RDD: 9/1/11</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which if timely received, shall be considered by the Agency. Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of SRR aircrew. Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight. Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or standard military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation. Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred), a certificate of conformance or traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures. Alternate Parts will be authorized if they are an approved alternate under the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) catalog system, which improves interoperability between NATO and commercial cataloging systems. Alternate parts must satisfy all form, fit, and function requirements of the original parts and conform to the approved configuration of the United States Coast Guard SRR aircraft. All parts shall be NEW approved parts. Offerors must be able to provide necessary certification including traceability to the manufacturer, manufacturer's COC and its own certificate of conformance to ensure parts are in airworthy condition, suitable for installation on U.S. Coast Guard aircraft.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Commandant (CG-931), U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, Procurement Planning &amp; Oversight Division, 1900 Half Street SW, JR11-0203, Washington, DC 20593-0001.<br />Telephone : (202) 372-3692; fax (202) 475-3904</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Cut tree selection shall consist of determining whether a naturally falling dead tree will impact the road based on DBH, tree height, and slope. Felled trees shall be left in place without limbing or bucking unless public safety and/or resource damage would occur. No green trees shall be cut unless they compromise the safety of the felling operations. <br /><br />The Contractor shall provide all equipment, supplies, transportation, labor, supervision, and incidentals necessary to complete the project; except for that which the contract clearly states is to be furnished by the Government.

See all attachments for the complete solicitation package. <br /><br />__________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) requires facilities management, maintenance &amp; logistics support services for the International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) training facility/campus in Roswell, New Mexico. <br /><br /><strong>Overview of Scope</strong> <br /><br /><br />
<p>PROGRAM SUMMARY: The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) advises the President, Secretary of State, other bureaus in the Department of State, and other departments and agencies within the U.S. Government on the development of policies and programs to combat international narcotics and crime.</p>
<p>One of INL's major goals is the enhancement of the professionalism of foreign criminal justice officials to enable them to efficiently combat crime in their respective countries and, at the same time, prevent the movement of transnational criminal elements into the United States and throughout the world. An effective and efficient way to accomplish this goal was the creation of an ILEA providing training to a global student body. In furtherance of this effort the Department of State established an International Law Enforcement Academy located in Roswell, New Mexico. The ILEA in Roswell became operational in 2001. The Academy has a dedicated campus facility with two training rooms, a series of small break-out rooms, administrative offices, a computer lab, and office space for instructors.</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide facility management and maintenance for the ILEA Roswell facility in Roswell, NM. The contractor shall also provide delegation logistical support for international students attending the ILEA Roswell training program in Roswell, NM. INL plans to host approximately 400 - 500 foreign government officials per year, multiple weeks at a time, as participants in various Department of State foreign policy and technical outreach training programs.</p>
<p>The contractor will coordinate all activities - facility and international delegations logistics - with the ILEA training facilitator to support the overall ILEA training program.</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />The Government is conducting a single source selection under this solicitation and intends to award one (1) contract by conducting a 100% HUBZone set-aside competition in accordance with FAR Part 15. We anticipate a one year contract with four one-year options which the Government reserves the right to unilaterally exercise any or all one-year options (IAW FAR 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract).</p>
<p><strong>Telephone requests for the solicitation will not be accepted.</strong></p>
<p>QUESTIONS: Prospective offeror(s) should submit any questions regarding this solicitation in writing by e-mail Contract Specialist, Terry Lord.

The contractor should have flexibility with their work plan and be able to forecast their work. A 48-hour notice is required for access. An escort is required for all work in the NASIC Complex. The contractor will need proper manpower in all relevant disciplines to work continuously in one work area and finish the work before moving on to the next area. Furthermore, in order to reduce the impact to NASIC's mission, only part of the work area will be vacated at a time. The contractor will be required to maintain meticulously kept work sites and material and debris delivery routes through the building. This project is on a historic building and is subject to State Historic Preservation Office SHPO oversight. Buildings 858, 828, and 829 are all considered historic buildings. The project ZHTV110025 (Option I, Chiller Number 5) is also subject to a statutory limitation of $750K.</p>

<p><strong>CMS has planned an Industry Day related to this effort. Please pay close attention to the following information;</strong></p>
<p>Date: July 6, 2011<br />Time: 1:00pm - 4:00pm EST <br />Website: https://webinar.cms.hhs.gov/pfp-engagement/ <br />Telephone number: (877)-267-1577<br />Participant Code: 5045<br />It is recommended that if you have never attended a Connect Pro meeting before, to test your connection and system requirements: <br />https://webinar.cms.hhs.gov/common/help/en/support/meeting_test.htm<br />When logging in to the webinar site as a guest, identify the organization and primary representative speaking on behalf of the organization. (i.e. Maryland Safe Hospitals Assoc - John Doe). The meeting room will be open thirty (30) minutes prior to the scheduled meeting time. It is strongly encouraged that you log-in during this period to ensure your acceptance into the online forum.</p>
<p>There will also be 200 audio conference lines available for those unable to utilize the on-line forum. Access to the audio conference will be on a first come, first serve basis.</p>
<p><strong>Please be advised: CMS does not expect any organizations to be present at CMS headquarters for this Industry Day.<br /></strong><br /><strong>Background</strong>:<br /><br />The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) will implement the Partnership for Patients (PFP). The PFP is a priority project designed to reduce inpatient harm by 40% and readmissions by 20% over a 3 year period. The PFP has identified ten areas of focus. Although the PFP will not limit its work to these areas and will pursue the reduction of all-cause harm, these focus areas are those for which content will be developed and learning activities conducted and made available to hospitals participating in the partnership. The Hospital Engagement Contractor (HEC) may address additional forms of harm and complications beyond this core set. <br />&bull; Adverse drug events (ADE)<br />&bull; Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI)<br />&bull; Central line-associated blood stream infections (CLABSI)<br />&bull; Injuries from falls and immobility<br />&bull; Obstetrical adverse events<br />&bull; Pressure ulcers<br />&bull; Surgical site infections<br />&bull; Venous thromboembolism (VTE)<br />&bull; Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)<br />&bull; Preventable readmissions<br /><br />Through coordinated efforts with industry and experts in the field of medicine, CMS has an interest in testing models such as large improvement networks aimed at rapidly studying, and identifying alternative methodologies and care models for bringing about rapid change and improvements in patient care. In support of the PFP, CMS will engage the hospital, provider and broader care-giver communities to quickly implement well-tested and measured best practices; the end result of the overall initiative is the anticipated reduction in hospital-based harm and preventable readmissions for our beneficiary population. Provided in Section J, Attachment 1 is a document outlining the overall goals of the PFP and the expected impact on the Medicare and Medicaid populations as well as the exponential impact on the broader population. Further information on other work in the PFP arena and other contracts in support of PFP may be found at J, Attachment 2.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>:<br /><br />Under the terms and conditions of this contract, the HECs will design and conduct various types of training events and sessions for hospitals. The training should be rooted in establishing and measuring/evaluating ongoing improvement projects in each participating hospital (or facility). All education activities are designed to achieve reductions in the ten core events and producing measurable improvements in quality measures associated with the ten core events. The success of the HEC will, in large part, be assessed through objective measurement of the incidence of the ten core events. The HECs will be required to coordinate their efforts with government and other contractor personnel involved in the PFP while performing tasks of this contract as defined in the requirements below. In order to successfully perform this contract, the HECs must host various training sessions for hospitals engaged in ongoing improvement projects. While it is anticipated that the HECs will engage in methods such as webinars, meetings and conferences to accomplish the work as defined in this contract, it must be noted that this is a performance-based contract; the expectation is that the contractors will specify in detail the methods they plan to use to meet the requirements as established by the Government.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="left">The Contracting Officer may utilize on-line Reverse Auctioning as a means of conducting price discussions under this solicitation. During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

<DESC>FEDBIZOPPS ANNOUNCEMENT SOURCES SOUGHT - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI)
<p>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3 --Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although proposal and offeror are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of identifying information on Repeater Site Monitor (RSM) systems that have already been developed or may be modified from other commercial industry solutions to meet the agency requirement as listed below:</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, is seeking sources interested in providing the component level hardware for a Repeater Site Monitor (RSM) system. The RSM Program will support the measurement and recording of signal parameters relating to radio repeaters and operating conditions inside the repeater enclosure. The recorded data are periodically retrieved and stored in a central data base that can be accessed through a web-based reporting system. <br /><br />The system is planned for operation in shielded communication shelters, walk-in communication shelters, observational look-out posts, and communication closets. Forest Service personnel with access to the Forest Service Intranet may view a web enabled utility that monitors trend data on operating and environmental parameters and determine if service is warranted at specific sites.</p>
<p>Ethernet capability is not available at all intended sites; the RSM device should be capable of communicating through an RS232 serial port as an alternative to the Ethernet port in the event that a serial data modem is required as part of the communications link.</p>
<p><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />Responses to this RFI are to include suggestions on design approaches with regards to the following specifications:</p>
<p>I. Continuous and Triggered Measurements<br />a) Several parameters require monitoring regardless of repeater activity. DC battery voltages, AC source voltages, enclosure temperature, and entry door status are parameters that should be checked frequently, although measurements may be binned hourly.<br />b) External voltage dividers or converters may be employed to convert the measured voltage levels into signals compatible with the RSM inputs. For turnkey systems, the voltage dividers should be transparent to the installer; that is, the installer should not have to construct an external circuit to comply with the input voltage limitations of the data logger.<br />c) Parameters associated with repeater activity need only to be measured when a repeater is active. Transmitter RF output power and reflected RF power from the antenna or duplexer should be monitored during transmissions; the push-to-talk signal (PTT) from the transmitter is the trigger for RF power measurements. On the receiver side, the carrier-operated relay (COR) signal from the receiver is the trigger for measuring the relative signal strength indicator (RSSI) output of the receiver.<br />d) Several parameters need to be measured repeatedly when the transmitter is active. Battery voltage is likely to sag during transmissions, and transmitter output power may vary as the power amplifier warms up. During an active PTT interval, maximum and minimum values should be recorded for battery voltage, forward RF power, and reflected RF power.<br />e) A desirable logging feature would be to record how many minutes in each hour have repeater activity.<br />f) Whereas routine data need only be reported daily and will be subject to polling from a server, out-of-tolerance conditions should initiate immediate data broadcasts to the server. Typical alarm conditions are open door, low enclosure temperature (near or below freezing), low battery voltage, or high reflected power.</p>
<p>II. Standard and Expanded Versions<br />The standard RSM should be capable of monitoring three repeaters and/or base stations. In addition, it should have inputs for monitoring at least four system voltages, enclosure temperature, and the status of the entry door. This collection of monitored parameters adds up to the following:<br />a) At least 7 digital inputs (door, 3 PTT inputs, 3 COR inputs);<br />b) At least 14 analog inputs (temperature in Fahrenheit, 6 RF power sensor levels, 3 RSSI inputs, 4 system voltage scalars).<br />c) Expansion options should be available for monitor 1-2 additional repeaters. This amounts to 2 digital inputs and 3 analog inputs per repeater/base station.</p>
<p>III. Probable specs list<br />a) 16 analog inputs (minimum count), 12 bit resolution or greater, +/- 5V range (minimum), sampling time &lt; 1mS. Analog inputs may be used for monitoring system voltages, temperature, outputs of RF power sensors, fuel level for backup power source.<br />b) RF power monitoring: directional RF watt meters should be capable of monitoring up to 100W of transmitter output power and 10W of reflected power from the antenna or combiner with less than 5% error. Accuracy should be specified for operation between 160-173MHz. The reflected power sensor should be capable of tolerating power levels of 50W for 5 minutes.<br />c) DC voltage monitoring: built-in voltage dividers provide scaling for full-scale voltages of<br />1) +/- 25V<br />2) +/- 50V<br />3) +/- 100V<br />d) 8 digital inputs (minimum count), voltage threshold near 2.0V, ability to withstand 15V inputs.<br />e) Active pull-ups available on PTT and open door sensor inputs.<br />f) Ethernet and serial (RS232) communications options.<br />g) At least 500 kB data memory.<br />h) 12V system operating voltage +4/-2V; 20 mA nominal operating current when not communicating.<br />i) Door Position Sensor: accepts normally-closed switch, such as a magnetic reed switch.<br />j) Environmental Considerations: Hardware will be capable of withstanding temperatures from -<br />-30&deg; to +60&deg; C</p>
<p>IV. Preferred mechanical configuration<br />a) 2U chassis for mounting in 19 inch relay rack. Final product may contain multiple 2U chassis.</p>
<p>V. Preferred RF connectors<br />a) N female.</p>
<p>VI. Preferred connection for power and signals <br />a) Rear panel terminal block.</p>
<p>VII. Communications and Database Software<br />a) The data logger must contain communications features that permit downloading data to a database and allows the logging program to be modified remotely. Client software must permit immediate connections to RSM and scheduled data downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />RESPONSES</p>
<p>Responses are to include the following:<br />a) Name of corporate point of contact, telephone number, full mailing address, e-mail address, CAGE Code, NAICS identifier and any other pertinent information.<br />b) Corporate competencies and past performance experience with regard to development and production of government and/or commercial RF sensor monitoring systems.<br />c) Whether your company's interest in the RSM program as a system developer prime contractor, a subcontractor or a vendor of components or services.<br />d) Describe any independent Research and Development programs applicable to Remote Site Monitoring.<br />e) OMITTED LINE<br />f) Companies should present their responses in the form of a whitepaper no more than 25 pages in length describing the information requested in this RFI. Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the whitepaper. <br />g) Responses shall be in Microsoft WORD <br />h) The format of your response shall be as follows:<br />1. Font size of Times New Roman 12 or a font of similar size and clarity.<br />2. 8.5 X 11 paper with 1 inch margins on all sides.<br />3. While there is no page limit, overly verbose qualification statements are strongly discouraged.<br />i) Companies should submit their response no later than 5:00 p.m. EST on 07/17/11.<br />j) Companies will submit their responses electronically to mdesouto@fs.fed.us, E-mail file sizes shall not exceed 6Mbs.<br />k) Technical questions may be directed to John Bates, via email at jwbates@fs.fed.us.</p>

<CONTACT>Anthony Foster, Phone 301-443-3415, Fax 301-443-2761, Email anthony.foster@psc.hhs.gov
<DESC><p><br />The Office of the Chief Privacy Officer (OCPO) within the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), through the Departmentof Health and Human Services, Division of Acquisition Management, Strategic Acquisition Service, Program Support Center (PSC), will be issuing a solicitation for the education, collection, and evaluation of patient choice in the electronic exchange of health information.</p>
<p>One of the key goals of the Federal Health Information Technology Strategic Plan is to inspire consumer trust and confidence in health information technology and electronic health information exchange. Informed patient choice is one way to ensure a trust relationship with patients for the success of electronic health information exchange. Recent recommendations by the Health Information Technology Policy Committee (HITPC) stress the importance of meaningful consent, noting that the person who has the treating relationship with the patient is responsible for educating patients regarding how information will be shared and with whom, as well as obtaining and tracking patient consent. The recommendations further state that ONC should provide resources to providers related to enabling patients to make meaningful choices with respect to consent.</p>
<p>With the growing interest in electronic consent mechanisms, and considering the role of meaningful patient choice in the success of electronic health information exchange, it is important to look carefully at the issues surrounding electronic consent. Research to date on this topic is limited, and in particular, the educational component of electronic consent must be explored in more detail. It is critical to understand what information patients desire and need when making decisions regarding their personal health information as well as what information they consider relevant for patient choice regarding the exchange of their health information in an electronic environment. In addition, it is essential to understand issues related to presenting educational material to patients about the realities associated with the electronic exchange of health information and patient choice with respect to sharing their health information. It will be important to address the unique challenges of collecting and tracking patient choice regarding sharing their health information in an electronic environment, where information exchanged between health care providers must indicate a patient's meaningful, informed choice and enable the patient choice to be honored.</p>
<p>The Contractor selected will use innovative ways to educate and inform individuals of their option to exercise individual choice in a clinical setting regarding the electronic exchange of their health information; and ensure that individuals are knowledgeable participants in decisions about the sharing their electronic health information in a clinical environment as well as explore and evaluate ways of electronically obtaining and recording meaningful, informed choice from individuals in a clinical setting, regarding the electronic exchange of their health information.</p>
<p>The anticipated contract period of performance will be for a 12-month base period plus one 12-month option period. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued approximately 15 days after this synopsis notice is issued and will be made available electronically at this address: http://www.fedbizopps.gov. Only electronic copies of the solicitation will be available. Proposals will be due approximately 30 days after the date the solicitation is issued. Competition will be restricted to small business concerns only, under NAICS Code 541990 during the period of July 6, 2011 through August 5, 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<DESC><br />Notice of intent to issue a sole source modification to contract:<br />HHSS277201000001C/Reference Number 277-10-0343 to: Avar Consulting, Inc., 1395 Piccard Drive, Suite 100, Rockville, Maryland 20850. The purpose of this contract modification is to add a separate optional task-Task 13, (in option years 1, 2 and 3 pending availability of funding) - to provide technical assistance (TA) to grantees under the Circles of Care (COC) program. COC is a three-year discretionary infrastructure grant program for American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) tribes, and tribal organizations (including Urban Indian programs and Tribal Colleges). The proposed technical assistance to COC grantees will provide tribal and urban Indian communities with tools and resources to plan and design a holistic, community-based, coordinated system of care to support mental health and wellness for children, youth and families. The TA will be for an estimated 7 grantees of the COC Cohort V, which will be selected based on a Request for Application (RFA) entitled, "Infrastructure Development for a Coordinated Children's Mental Health System in American Indian/Alaska Native Communities grants.
<p>Avar Consulting, Inc. is uniquely qualified to provide the services contracted under this modification. Avar already provides technical assistance and training under the Native American Center for Excellence (NACE) - Preventive Technical Assistance contract. The contractor will be required to implement complex individualized technical assistance to a wide diversity of tribal and urban Indian communities across the country. The contractor must demonstrate a proven track record of working with the diverse cultures in "Indian Country" as well as a high degree of knowledge of the context and workings of tribal sovereignty and the potential political volatility in tribal communities that can impact services and systems. The contractor must also demonstrate knowledge and experience with the Circles of Care grant program as it is unique in its approach. The contractor must have expertise and experience with the "Systems of Care" values and principles (modeled in the Circles of Care grant program and also the Child Mental Health Initiative) in a way that helps grantees to implement those values and principles in their communities. The current NACE contractor, Avar Consulting, Inc. and its sub-contractor, Kauffman and Associates, Inc. have demonstrated all of the above qualifications.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for TA services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only once source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (41 U.S.C. 253c(1)) only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all capabilities received within (45) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contractor based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<DESC>06/22/2011 Amendment 10 Notice and Q&amp;A
<p>Notice<br />Amendments 1 through 10 are repeated in the new attachment for ease in reading.</p>
<p>Q44. SOW states "Depending of requirements and funding availability the Government may require additional support". Since the "additional" support seems to be contingent on additional funding, please confirm whether or not the Offerors' cost proposals will be evaluated including the costs of the "additional" staff and specified "additional" ODCs and travel? If so, please clarify how these "additional" costs will be evaluated.<br />A44. Please review Sections L and M of the RFP for the evaluation factors. Each proposal will be evaluated, including the costs of additional staff. Costings of ODCs and travel for the purpose of the cost evaluation are provided by the Government and are the same for each offeror. The primary focus on evaluating costs is on current requirements.</p>
<p>Q45. Section H of the solicitation includes the following DFARs clauses: H.10 252.225-7023 - Preferences for products or services from Iraq or Afghanistan, H.11 252.225-7024 - Requirement for products or services from Iraq or Afghanistan, and H.12 252.225-7026 - Acquisition restricted to products or services from Iraq or Afghanistan. Given the nature of the products and services to be provided under the resultant contract, it appears that these clauses should not be applicable. Please clarify.<br />A45. It is probable those clauses will not apply.</p>
<p>Q46. The pages total to 70 when you add each section, but the total page limit listed at the bottom of the table is 75. It would be useful to know whether 75 is in error, and the total is actually 70. Can please confirm the total page count?<br />A46. My apologies. The pages total 70 and the 75 is in error. Page 95 of 111, L 1.6 should read 70 for the total.</p>
<p>Q47. Section M.3 of the RFP states that proposals should address the following topics: "A description of the offeror's plan for stat-up and transition of work for this contract. Elements that may be examined include but are not limited to the following: If required the plan for recruitment and hiring of new personnel, if applicable the timeline for the transitioning of current contractor employees, The plan for processing new and transitioning personnel for required accesses with DIA security, The anticipated transition or overlap time required with incumbent contract personnel." <br />The verbiage of Section M.3 insinuates that there are incumbent personnel to be transitioned, yet Question #2/Answer #2 posted on May 25th states "this is a new effort". Will the Government clarify is there are incumbent personnel to be transitioned, how many, and in what positions they currently serve? This lack of information and clarification puts prospective offerors at an evaluation disadvantage when responding to the RFP.<br />A47. The Government expects all offerors to propose a transition plan and will not dictate the personnel to be proposed.</p>
<p>Q48. If there are no incumbent personnel to transition, will the Government consider removing the Section M requirements from the RFP related to transitioning incumbent personnel?<br />A48. See A47. Each offeror should write their own proposal.</p>
<p>Q49. SOW 5.2 and 5.4 state the requirement for a total of 5.0 FTE for the Sr. Engineer/SC RF Engineer position. The revised pricing template indicates that there is a total of 5.5 FTE to be bid against the Sr. Engineer/SC RF Engineer position. Is the Government's requirement 5.0 FTE for the Sr. Engineer/SC RF Engineer position in support of SOW paragraphs 5.2 and 5.4 ?<br />A49. Please use the numbers of FTE from the SOW and not the cost worksheet. The error is mine.</p>
<p>Q50. Section L.1.13 of the RFP states "For tables, charts, graphs and figures, the text shall be no smaller than 12-point font." Will the Government consider allowing a smaller font size for these items provided that they are still easily legible?<br />A50. Yes, for tables, charts, graphs and figures, an offeror may use a smaller font size than 12 point, provided they are still easily legible.</p>
<p>Q51. Is the industry day attendees list available for distribution? If yes, may we request a copy?<br />A51. See A21.</p>

<DESC><p>This RFI is only seeking responses from University Affiliated Research Center(s) (UARCs). This is a Request for Information (RFI), to gain knowledge of interest and capabilities. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS. The Government DOES NOT intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses to this RFI.</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>The Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Acquisition Directorate (AD) on behalf of the Office of the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer (DOD CIO), has potential requirements for University Affiliated Research Center(s) (UARCs) to establish and maintain an essential network enabled services/information technology research or development capability to be provided by an educational institution. The network enabled services/information technology research or development capability sought is one that is ordinarily found in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs) which require unique security provisions. The UARC designation was established by Congress and is administered under direction/guidance by the Department of Defense (DOD) Director Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E) office. WHS/AD is seeking information from University Affiliated Research Center(s) (UARCs) with the demonstrated essential network enabled services/ information technology capabilities. The potentially needed/required core capabilities are outlined below. Potentially needed/required University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) core capabilities are:</p>
<p>1. Net-Centricity: Detailed functional knowledge and experience in the organization, culture, and technologies of net-centric information sharing methodologies, network-enabled services to facilitate cross-component operations, and advanced network encryption techniques to harness the potential of platforms, software, and infrastructure such as "cloud computing" and Web 2.0.</p>
<p>2. Information and Mission Assurance: Detailed functional knowledge and experience in enterprise security management, cyber surveillance &amp; reconnaissance, trusted data &amp; platforms, network resiliency, universal cyber identification friend or foe, and transactional protection. <br /><br />3.

<p>4. Social Networks: Detailed functional knowledge and experience in the application of large-scale social media, social networks, and how social networks can be used as tools to organize large groups of people with common interests (e.g. how social networks could potentially be used to solve geo-location and information-gathering problems; and the potential military applications using web-based crowd-sourcing techniques).</p>
<p>5. Mobile Software Applications (Apps): Detailed functional knowledge and experience in enabling the development of diverse military apps with national security relevance (e.g. creating the right mobile software applications for warfighters as the apps are needed).<br /><br />6. Wireless IT: Detailed functional knowledge and experience in new wireless applications such as machine-to-machine wireless communications that could significantly impact planned communications infrastructure capacities (e.g. battlefield components that communicate automatically when spare parts, fuel, ammunition, or other products need to be resupplied).</p>
<p>7. Information Services: Detailed functional knowledge and experience in the evolution of leadership command information services and capabilities, for continued experimentation and analysis of alternative system concepts and configurations to achieve worldwide voice conferencing for command and control and communications (C3) networks and systems -- to be available globally, under various stressing scenarios, across specified mobile platforms, fixed sites, and various ad hoc locations -- its extension of quality and collaborative conferencing capabilities to other networks, and an assured means for graceful degradation to a subset of C3 infrastructure that is fully survive-able and secure.</p>
<p>8. Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications: Detailed functional knowledge and experience in Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3) systems and networks; in elements of System Engineering applicable to information systems and networks focused on technical elements contributing to the NC3 mission and requirements; and knowledge and experience in architecting robust networks supporting integrated voice, video, and data conferencing and collaboration - information sharing, situation awareness, and alternative courses of actions development and displays.</p>

<DESC>VA provides information to public requestors in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and its amendments as well as the Privacy Act (where requests are made for a persons own records).  FOIA requests are processed by VAs Central Office (VACO) and by VA field offices.  VAs Office of Privacy and Records Management has responsibility for processing developing and implementing policy associated with the FOIA across the department, preparing reports for senior-level leadership, researching and gathering documents related to Discovery requests under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as well as processing FOIA requests received at VACO.  In addition, as a result of recent amendments to the FOIA, the Office of Privacy and Records Management is moving to implement mediation, as a tool, to resolve disputes between VA and the FOIA requestor.  VACO has a backlog of approximately 500 FOIA requests that must be processed/resolved.  VA receives requests for records from Veterans, Veterans organizations, the media and other interest groups.  These requests ask for information that is subject to the Privacy Act, contract information, and budget and personnel data.  Processing these requests calls for knowledge of the FOIA exemptions and applying them as they have been interpreted by the courts.  The purpose of this contract is to acquire contractor services to assist the Office of Privacy and Records Management in accomplishing its mission.  The contractor shall provide services to assist VAs Office of Privacy and Records Management in processing FOIA requests to reduce the backlog of outstanding requests.  The contractor shall provide assistance in collecting and reporting metrics related to FOIA requests to VA leadership.  As experience is gained with VA FOIA protocol, the contractor shall assist VA in updating Agency-wide guidance in processing/reporting on the FOIA Program.  The contractor shall also provide mediation support to VA in resolving FOIA disputes and assisting in responding to Discovery requests for materials involved in litigation.  Contractor services shall be performed on-site at VACO.  The contractor shall comply with all VA policies and procedures related to security and handling sensitive information.

<DESC>MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD<br><br>SUBJECT:  ATC Sole Source Award to:  Meggitt (San Juan Capistrano), Inc.<br>AWARD AMOUNT:  $39,963.51  PR# W81C5M11573398<br><br>1.  Requirement:  The government has an ongoing requirement for Endevco Accelerometers, used in Stryker Livefire Events. The subject procurement is for twenty-seven (27) units.<br><br>2.  Description of Action:  The government will make a sole source award to Meggitt (San Juan Capistrano), Inc.  This action is restricted to:<br>	Meggitt (San Juan Capistrano), Inc. <br>	30700 Rancho Viejo Road<br>	San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675-1788<br><br>3.  Description of Supplies/Services:  The subject Accelerometer will be delivered within thirty (30) days of issuance of the contract. The Endevco Accelerometer is used by Aberdeen Test Center for measuring acceleration speeds during ongoing Stryker livefire testing on the range. <br>4.  Authority Cited:  Acquisition is under the authority of the test program for commercial items section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) 6.302-1, "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements."<br><br>5.  Reason for Authority Cited:  Subject models are the only products created with correct software, and meeting Test Center requirements. The subject procurement has been assigned a priority rating of 01.<br>The Endevco Accelerometers, manufactured by Meggitt (San Juan Capistrano), are the only transducers validated to possess the necessary compatibility with legacy data already collected for this and other livefire programs. Purchase of an invalidated alternate would compromise post-test analysis by introducing a variable into ongoing testing. Endevco Transducers are presently specified for use in existing internal operating procedures; introduction of an alternate would require development of new procedures for use of any proposed candidate transducer. Such a change would result in replication of effort, and invalidation of testing performed to date. <br>The proposed vendor, Meggitt (San Juan Capistrano), Inc., is the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) for the requested item. Meggitt is an American business registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR), CAGE Code 95411. <br><br>6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  An extensive market search was conducted without success. All available literature was researched and a wide spread internet search was conducted.  The subject procurement will be posted on ASFI as a Notice of Intent to Award Sole Source.<br><br>7.  Justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.<br><br>8.   Point of contact is the Jennifer L. Gordon at (410) 278-0886 (DSN 298) or email Jennifer.L.Gordon.civ@mail.mil  . <br>
