<DESC>Notice of Intent for DTMO/Program Management Support Services
<p><br />The Defense Human Resources Activity (DHRA)/Contracting Directorate (PK) intends to extend current contract H98210-17-F-0005 with NTT DATA Services Federal Government, Inc. (NTT Data) at the Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO), Mark Center, Alexandria, Virginia. The current contract with NTT Data ends 4 April 2018, and is anticipated to be extended for up to three (3) months and one (1) day, from 5 April 2018, through 5 July 2018. This proposed extension will enable DHRA to continue critical requirements for DTMO Program Support Services at the Mark Center while DHRA/PK supports the Government Accountability Office protest process.</p>
<p><br />The proposed extension is based upon the exclusion found at Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1 and 41 United States Code 3304(a)(1), which authorizes other than full and open competition when there is only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements within the limited time frame. To DHRA's knowledge, only NTT Data has the requisite knowledge, experience and capability to provide these critical services without interruption during the acquisition cycle for transition to a new contract. Essentially, NTT Data is the only company qualified to show a new contractor the current operational considerations of DTMO's Program Support requirement.</p>
<p>THERE ARE NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE FOR THIS REQUIREMENT. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. Interested, responsible sources may submit information about their capability to perform this requirement, which shall be considered by the agency. Capability statements must be received by the response date and time of this notice. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<DESC>NOAA's NMFS, Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Auke Bay Laboratories, intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Helmut Lehnert for taxonomic laboratory services to identify specimens and describe new species of sponges form the eastern Bering Sea surveys.
<p>The Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) of the National Marine Fisheries Service conducts research to describe coral and sponge habitat in Alaskan waters and to assess the effects of fishing activities on that habitat. Part of that research involves the collection and identification of sponge fauna so that areas of high abundance and diversity can be mapped with field identifications made by fisheries observers and research biologists. A field guide has recently been published that provides detailed information on more than 100 species of sponges in Alaskan waters but many species have not yet been collected and consequently have not been identified. A dedicated effort to collect sponges from NMFS annual trawl surveys in the eastern Bering Sea was undertaken between 2012 and 2016 to provide a comprehensive inventory of sponge fauna from shelf and slope habitats. This work was specifically requested by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council (NPFMC) as part of an ongoing review of the ecological importance of Bering Sea canyons habitat. The 2016 Bering Sea slope collections were much more diverse than anticipated. This work will examine sponge specimens from the remaining collections of the 2016 survey.</p>
<p>Additionally, AFSC scientists are involved in a collaborative research program between the United States and the Republic of Korea to establish protocol and policy on fishing encounters with sensitive biota in the international waters of the Emperor Seamount region of the North Pacific Ocean. Specifically, the work addresses the United Nations (UN) General Assembly Resolution 61/105 that calls on States to directly, or through Regional Fisheries Management Organizations, apply a precautionary ecosystem approach to sustainably manage fish stocks and protect vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) in deep-sea fisheries on the high seas. Some deep-sea sponges are indicator species of VMEs and accordingly were retained as bycatch in fisheries for formal identification.</p>
<p>Specifically we request taxonomic services to 1) Examine samples from 8 demosponge specimens (with an Option for up to 20 additional specimens) using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy if necessary. Provide identifications for the samples. 2) For 3 undescribed species (with an Option for up to 3 additional specimens), provide a general description of the gross morphology, a detailed description of the skeleton and spicules, a general discussion of geographical distribution, a comprehensive comparison of relevant morphological and habitat characteristics with congeners from the region, and a literature review. The species descriptions including detailed images of diagnostic features will be submitted to a peer-reviewed scientific journal for publication. And 3) Submit type material (specimens) to an appropriate institution for proper archiving and registration.</p>
<p><br />Award for this requirement will be issued in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13. Anticipated value will be under the Simplified acquisition procedures with an estimated value of less than $60,000. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. Interested person may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is the Government's belief that only the State of Alaska, Department of Fish and Game, can provide services as stated herein. If you feel that your firm possesses the ability to provide these requirements, then you must respond by demonstrating your firm's technical capability to meet these requirements prior to posting closing. No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy these requirements.</p>
