<DESC>Contract N68936-04-D-0019 Tybrin Corporation is one of three Multiple-Award Contracts (MAC's) for Combat Environment Simulation (CES) support at Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division (NAWCWD), China Lake, CA.  NAWCWD intends to negotiate on an other-than-competitive basis an extension of the contract ordering period from December 21, 2009 to March 31, 2010.  Contract type: Cost Plus Award Fee (CPAF), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), level-of-effort (LOE).  The other two CES MAC's are N68936-04-D-0020 with Lockheed Martin Services and N68936-04-D-0022 with L-3 Services Inc., Global Security & Engineering Solutions (L-3 GSES).  The purpose of the modification is to increase the ceiling and extend the ordering period of the contract.  The level-of-effort will be increased by approximately 59,000 hours for the contract.  The work is competed among the multi-award contracts at the order level using best value source selection processes.  An increase to the ceiling for Contract N68936-04-D-0019 is necessary in order to modify existing orders on the contract to meet program needs until follow-on multiple award contracts can be awarded.  The extension is needed to avoid work stoppage on existing programs until the follow-on solicitation can be released and awards made from it.  Contractors who believe that they can step in and take over a program must submit a written response demonstrating technical, cost and management capability without causing hardships to program schedule and costs.  No new work requirements are planned for the current contracts and orders.  Requirements are competed among the CES MAC's and awarded and funded at the task/delivery order level.  The Combat Environment Simulation (CES) Division at China Lake requires support to develop and acquire new range systems, integrate various range systems and upgrade and modernize existing range systems.  Specifically, there are requirements for the integration of various T&E and training systems into existing range systems and infrastructure; the fielding of systems at new range locations; the modification/update/upgrade of major software systems, and the development, modification, or integration of supporting range systems and assets (for participants tracking, data communications, exercise monitoring, and debrief, etc.). The CES Division also requires a variety of engineering, technical and management services related to development, fabrication, procurement, integration, test, training and technical support of radar and pod instrumentation systems, EO/IR/MW/UV/Laser/C4I Threat Simulator systems, tactical training ranges for all DoD services, related network-centric systems and components, Advanced Air Defense technological concepts, Information Assurance/Operations, Artificial Intelligence, and Neural Networking in a Network Centric Warfare environment.  As required by specific task orders, the contractor shall design, develop, fabricate, install, integrate, and test network-centric warfare equipment and/or systems designed to provide a dense, realistic, electromagnetic  (radio frequency, infrared, electro-optic, and laser energy) environment to be used by the Defense community for weapon systems development, real-time aircrew tactical training, test and evaluation, test and evaluation of defense suppression systems, electronic warfare (EW) systems, electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment, and electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) equipment.  These efforts include fixed and moving ground, sea, and air targets, multi-lateration and GPS-based instrumentation pods, threat emitters, integrated hardware/software systems and environments and hostile equipment modeled entirely in software.  The body of projects executed by this division take on the look and feel of a single unified acquisition.  Level of facility clearance required: SECRET.  Level of safeguarding required: SECRET.  Contractor's interested in subcontracting opportunities contact the Prime Contractor.  All responsible sources, that submit a proposal, shall be considered by the Agency.  The anticipated award date of the modification: December 18, 2009.  N68936-09-R-0001 is the solicitation for the CES follow-on and was synopsized on October 21, 2009.  Anticipated date of award for the follow-on is March 31, 2010.  Questions should be addressed to Commander Code 220000D, Naval Air Warfare Center Weapons Division, 429 East Bowen Road - Stop 4105, China Lake, CA 93555-6108.  POC: Contract Specialist, William Monckton at (760) 939-8234, FAX (760) 939-8329.  Note 25.

<DESC>(RECOVERY ACT) The National Institute on Aging, NIA/IRP, intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a competitive basis for the purchase of the following equipment under Simplified Acquisition procedures of less than $100,000. This notice may represent the only official notice.
<p>The National Institute on Aging requires the following equipment:</p>
<p>1. Qty 1 set; ULTIMA CARDIO2 "Trade-UP" Program; Pulmonary Exercise Systems with Combined 12-Lead ECG.</p>
<p>The above equipment is being procured for Harbor Hospital Clinical Research Branch to support the Baltimore Longitudinal Study in Aging (BLSA). In the BLSA the evaluation of mobility is done from multiple perspectives. One important perspective is the study of the kinematic of gait that is done in our Gait Lab. Developing and testing this methodology has required almost 5 years, the data generated now are high quality and are already producing important findings that provide original information to the literature. This equipment will replace and update the current system that has been used in the Gait Lab for the last 6 years and is now surpassed by new improved technology. This system can no longer be supported and serviced by its provider. Updating this equipment will also overcome some of the structural limitations of the laboratory concerning space requirements.</p>
<p>Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice is a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received prior to 05/29/2009 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>
