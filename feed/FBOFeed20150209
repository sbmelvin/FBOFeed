However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

<DESC>PRESOLICITATION NOTICE <br> TEST ENGINEERING AND ANALYSIS SERVICES (TEAS) <br>  <br>  <br> PS-I - Introduction.   <br>  <br> The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for Test Engineering and Analysis Services, performed at WSMR, New Mexico.  A five-year (inclusive of option periods) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) single award contract is being considered for this effort.  The requirement is being set-aside for 8(a) Small Business concerns.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, Engineering Services, with a size standard of $35.5M.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or around 9 May 2014. <br>  <br> Due to the potential for Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCI), this acquisition will be conducted using the advisory multi-step process pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202.  The link to the draft Performance Work Statement will be listed at the bottom of this notice so potential offerors can make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition.  This synopsis constitutes the Pre-Solicitation Notice and Step 1 of the solicitation process.  In this step, potential offerors will submit OCI-Free certification or submit information on potential, actual, or perceived organizational conflicts of interest that may affect offeror's viability for award (no other capabilities will be evaluated during this step).  The MICC, WSMR Contracting Office requests that potential offerors submit information that will allow the Government to advise them about their potential as viable OCI-Free competitors.  The required submission information is outlined in  quote mark OCI Submission Instructions quote mark  below.  The offeror's submission shall be sent electronically to Mari B. Beckler at mari.b.beckler.civ@mail.mil and are due by 4:30pm MT on 14 March 2014.  Submissions not received by the deadline of 14 March 2014 at 4:30 pm MT will be handled as a Late Proposal subject to the rules in subparagraph c of FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Competitive Acquisition. <br>  <br> After the Government reviews and evaluates OCI responses, each offeror shall be advised in writing if it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable OCI-Free competitor.  Respondents not considered viable competitors due to OCI issues will receive the general basis for these findings.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(b), those respondents will also be advised that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their OCI submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.  The invite to participate in resultant acquisition does not absolve the offeror of additional OCI scrutiny and the Government reserves the right to eliminate offerors from competition if conflicts are discovered at any point during the acquisition.  The decision to participate in this acquisition is a business decision made by the offeror and the Government shall not be held liable for excluding any offeror from participation based on OCI determination. <br>  <br> PS-II - Clauses that will be included in the resultant solicitation and contract. <br>  <br> (1) 5152.209-4000 PERSONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (PCI). (MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE) <br>  <br> The contractor shall not employ any person whose employment under the contract could in any way result in a conflict of interest.  The contractor shall not employ any person who is currently an employee of the Department of Army, military or civilian, to perform work under this contract if such employment would create a conflict of interest or be contrary to the policies contained in this PWS.  In no event shall such personnel be utilized in a supervisory capacity in the performance of this contract.  In addition, the contractor shall not offer a position to any current or former Department of Army employee, military or civilian, who has not first obtained the approvals required by DOD Directive 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), and implementing Army Regulations 24.  The contractor shall not employ any person who is a family member of either current contractor employees or current ATEC employees (either military or civilian) without first providing personnel qualifications, supervisory chain, and proposed employment duration to the Contracting Officer for review and concurrence. <br>  <br> (2) 5152.209-4001 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (OCI) (MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE) <br>  <br> In accordance with Section A - Executive Summary OCI, ATEC requires the Contractor to have the ability to conduct both developmental testing and operational testing without mitigation of potential OCIs.  Title 10, US Code Section 2399 prohibits the involvement of a defense contractor in the operational test and evaluation of its own systems and equipment.  Consequently, all parties must be particularly sensitive to potential, actual, or perceived organizational conflicts of interest where system contractors are, or appear to be, involved in the operational testing and evaluation of their own equipment or systems, including involvement as a test support contractor.  Such involvement is strictly prohibited. The Contractor acknowledges that it is cognizant of Title 10 U.S.C. Section 2399 and FAR 9.5 and agrees that it will avoid conflicts of interest and, to the maximum extent possible, the appearance of conflict of interest, in accordance with the principles set forth in the statute and the FAR.  The contractor also acknowledges that statutory operational testing and evaluation conflicts of interest arising under Title 10 U.S.C. 2399 and Army Regulation 73-1, paragraph 5-6, may not be mitigated or  quote mark firewalled quote mark  using the FAR 9.5 procedures. <br>  <br> (3) 5152.209-4002 DISCLOSURE OF ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST AFTER CONTRACT AWARD. (MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE) <br>  <br> (a) If the Contractor identifies an organizational conflict of interest that was not previously addressed and for which a waiver has not been granted, or a change to any relevant facts relating to a previously identified organizational conflict of interest, the Contractor shall make a prompt and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  Organizational conflicts of interest that arise during performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed before contract award, shall be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of- <br>  <br> (1) The organizational conflict of interest; and <br>  <br> (2) Actions to address the conflict that- <br>  <br> (i) The Contractor has taken or proposes to take; or <br>  <br> (ii) The Contractor recommends that the Government take. <br>  <br> (b) If, in compliance, the Contractor identifies and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest that cannot be addressed in a manner acceptable to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for the convenience of the Government. <br>  <br> (c) Subcontracts.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this special contract requirement, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts where the work includes or may include tasks that may create a potential for an organizational conflict of interest. <br>  <br> Please note, while this first step is advisory, should an organizational conflict be identified before contract award, the offeror may be determined to be ineligible for the award.  <br>  <br> PS-III - OCI Submission Instructions <br>  <br> The offeror's submittal shall be submitted electronically and should include information on any potential Organizational Conflicts of Interests (OCI).  The offeror shall describe their involvement in the development of any DoD System with details including contract numbers, dates, programs supported, a copy of Performance Work Statement to include list of deliverables, as well as contact information for Program Manager points of contact and contracting office points of contact.  Offerors shall discuss any competitions for developmental work in which the company is involved regardless of the stage of the acquisition.  The offeror shall present its rationale for why the cited development work does not create an OCI.  Supporting information for the assertion that there is no OCI is vital to facilitate the Government's evaluation of an OCI.  The offerors will be required to identify teaming arrangements, subcontractor and any perceived conflicts of interest pursuant to Title 10 United States Code, Section 2399, FAR 9.5 and ATEC Policy Bulletin 2-11.  The offeror must certify, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that it is not aware of any information bearing on the existence of any organizational conflict of interest (potential or perceived) that impacts its ability to perform Initial Operational Testing and Evaluation (IOT&E) of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) systems.  The offeror must also include the same certification from each teaming partner and potential subcontractor.  Offerors' OCI certifications will be reviewed by contracting officer and legal support and an advisory notice will be given to each offeror.  A Non-OCI certification template is available via the link below; however, offeror's may submit the certification/information in any format compatible with Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Office, as long as it includes all of the required information and is certified. In responses from offerors that indicate a potential OCI exists, offeror responses are limited to no more than ten pages. However, this page limitation does not apply to supplemental data such as, independent PWS, etc. <br>  <br> The draft Performance Work Statement and OCI Free Certification Template are available at: <br>  <br> http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Contracting/Pages/default.aspx <br>  <br>  <br>

The definitions from EIA-649-1 apply to items being procured under this solicitation/contract, with the following clarification of Deviation &amp; Waiver:<br />A. Pre-Production RFV (previously known as deviation) requests permission to produce a product that does not conform to contract requirements/documentation for a limited amount of time and for specified effectivity. (A deviation differs from an engineering change in that an approved engineering change requires corresponding revision of the item's current approved configuration documentation, whereas a deviation does not.).<br />B.

Contractor responsibilities.<br />A. An Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) is used to make permanent changes in the Government technical data package (TDP). Pending approval of an ECP, contractual relief should be requested in writing by the Contractor using a RFV.<br />B.

The TEB will consist of engineers, scientists, chemists, environmental specialists, and regulatory agency personnel who have experience in specific environmental technology areas. The abstracts will not be evaluated against each other since each possesses a unique technology with no common work statement.
 When an abstract aligns with a customer need and funding, the NAVFAC contracting office may request a full proposal. Additional guidance will be provided at that time, regarding cost and pricing submittals in addition to a more comprehensive technical submission.

Technical Evaluation: Unsuccessful abstracts will not receive a detailed description of the reasons for abstract rejection due to the anticipated volume of submissions. Unsuccessful full proposals will receive a debriefing in accordance with FAR 15. Awards will be in the form of contracts. Average contract duration is one (1) to three (3) years. The government may choose to fund a base period with options.

The abstracts will be evaluated based on the following CRITERIA, of approximately equal weight.
 
1).
 TECHNICAL APPROACH: The scientific/technical merits and objectives of the abstract, in terms of Naval relevance. All proposals must demonstrate an approach that will achieve a DOD technology readiness level (TRL) of 5/6, and successfully manage risk while achieving technological advance.  Provide an explicit, detailed description of the approach.  If options are required describe appropriate research activities which would commence for subsequent options.  The abstract should indicate what tasks are planned, how and where the work will be conducted, a schedule of major events, and the final product(s) to be delivered.  Offerors effort should attempt to determine the technical feasibility of the proposed concept.
  The methods planned to achieve each objective or task should be discussed in detail.  This section should be a substantial portion of the abstract.

<DESC><br />Solicitation Number: N00173-14-R-RV04<br />Notice Type: Presolicitation Notice<br />Closing Date: 27 May 2014 @ 12:00pm EST.<br />Classification Code: AC14 - R&amp;D- Defense System: Aircraft (Engineering Development)<br />NAICS Code: 541 - Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services<br />541712 - Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology)<br />
<p>The Naval Research Laboratory is pursuing placement of a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contract with a five year ordering period for engineering and technical support for the performance of specialized design, fabrication, installation, operation, removal, disposal, and maintenance of unique research systems associated with VXS-1 airborne research laboratories. The estimated value of this acquisition is $25,000,000.00.</p>
<p>To accomplish airborne-related S&amp;T requirements, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) has tasked the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Scientific Development Squadron ONE (VXS-1) to provide the necessary aircraft and support personnel. In turn, NRL maintains a Military Support Division (MSD), Code 1400, that ensures military and contractor personnel are available to meet project requirements. MSD also provides coordination and serves as a liaison between the scientific communities at NRL, other government activities and VXS-1 at Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River, Maryland. VXS-1 employs numerous aircraft to accomplish ground and flight test evolutions.</p>
<p>A complete performance work statement (PWS), personnel requirements, and contract data requirements will be available as part of this solicitation. <br /><br />A DD254, Contract Security Classification Specification, shall be applicable to any prospective work covered under this solicitation. Prospective contractors must have: (1) the required SECRET facility clearance and (2) personnel available with favorably adjudicated investigations and final DoD granted personnel security clearances. <br />Note: NRL does not sponsor clearances for contractors.</p>
<p>The anticipated ordering period shall be five (5) years from the date of contract award.<br /><br />Based on a survey of the market, the government has determined that the services to be acquired do not meet the definition of a commercial item. Therefore, the government does not intend to use the procedures as outlined in FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.<br /><br />This solicitation is issued on a full and open competitive basis. The Government anticipates award of multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contracts with Firm-Fixed Price and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee term and completion type task orders.<br /><br />NRL uses electronic commerce (EC) to issue requests for proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued. <br />This solicitation and any amendments to it will be available via the internet starting approximately fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement at the URL provided below. <br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency. Other business opportunities for NRL are available at our website http://heron.nrl.navy.mil/contracts/rfplist.htm.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Center for Space Technology (NCST), located at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) in Washington, DC, is the designated lead laboratory for Navy space programs. NCST has the mission to "preserve and enhance a strong space technology base and provide expert capabilities in the development and acquisition of space systems which support Naval missions." NCST has the primary responsibility to develop space systems, spacecraft payloads, tactical communications, aerospace systems, and to actively pursue emerging technologies in an effort to advance space, tactical, and aerospace system development.
<p>The NCST defines system requirements based on overall mission objectives, develops alternative system architectures, designs and develops systems and subsystems, and implements technologies to achieve optimized operational systems.</p>
<p>Scope: NCST develops spacecraft for numerous DoD, NASA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and other government agency customers. These efforts have resulted in successful satellite operations in low, medium, highly elliptical, and geosynchronous orbits. The ability of the center to rapidly produce cost effective and reliable spacecraft and components is directly related to the experience of the engineering team and the ability to apply and modify development techniques, software procedures, processors, and other hardware components to accomplish new requirements. A vast collection of reusable and application specific software components, test procedures, operating system modifications, and other software has been collected and organized. This collection requires continued new development, enhancement, maintenance, test, and configuration management as required by new programs.</p>
<p>Efforts of the tasks delineated in the Performance Requirements of the SOW will be conducted in coordination with Principal Investigator (PI) led research teams that may include Government scientists and other Contractors. The quality and timeliness of the provider's contribution to the work will be evaluated in terms of its impact on the success of the overall project.</p>
<p>This Statement of Work (SOW) defines the technical and managerial tasks required to design, develop, test, maintain, enhance, and provide configuration control for all software modules related to spacecraft and space component development/test and system operations. This includes: <br />1)	The Neptune<sup>TM</sup> Software<br />2)	Ground Station and Mission Operations <br />3)	Spacecraft and Payload Integration and Test <br />4)	Real-time Embedded Software<br />5)	Other software</p>
<p>The solicitation and a detailed statement of work, personnel qualifications and other supporting information including contract data requirements will be posted approximately 15 days from the posting of this notice.</p>
<p>Based on a survey of the market, the government has determined that the services to be acquired do not meet the definition of a commercial item. Therefore, the government does not intend to use the procedures as outlined in FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that an Indefinite Delivery - Indefinite Quantity type contract with an ordering period of five years will be awarded as a result of the solicitation.</p>
<p>The current contract, N00173-09-C-6001, was awarded to Space Ground Systems Solutions, Inc. (SGSS).</p>
<p>NRL uses Electronic Commerce (EC) to issue Requests for Proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a 100% small business set-aside.  All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

This announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) for the purpose of conducting market research only. No solicitation exists. This is not a request for a quote, request for proposal, or an invitation to bid, nor is this to be construed as a commitment by the US Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.

REQUIREMENT: This market research is being conducted to identify potential sources that may possess the expertise, capabilities and experience to: Provide Jet Fuel Starter Repair components as identified in Attachment 1, Jet Fuel Starter Sustainment Parts List brand name or equivalent.

<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION/MARKET RESEARCH SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (RFI/MR SSS). THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

<p>This is a new requirement for which no previous Sources Sought Synopsis has been posted by this requiring activity, AFLCMC/WLVSA (Tinker AFB, OK). Attached is the draft performance work statement (PWS).</p>
<p>The United States Air Force, through the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, is conducting market research to identify potential business sources interested in providing Subject Matter Expert services in support of E-4B Aircraft Sustainment Information Assurance (IA), including requirements development and accomplishment of certifications and accreditations. This requirement is in support of airborne National Military Command Systems (NMCS) architecture development and NMCS node interoperability planning. Extensive certification, accreditation and technical support are required primarily in E-4B systems, but also with systems that interface to the NMCS and other unique areas, which include: Super High Frequency (SHF), Satellite Communications (SATCOM) equipment, Low Frequency (LF)/Very Low Frequency (VLF) communications systems, integration of legacy radios, Crypto and SATCOM equipment into digital switches. All of these systems have to be able to perform their function in a nuclear hardened environment.</p>
<p>The E-4B serves as the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) for the National Command Authorities (NCA) and provides a worldwide-deployable, enduring node of the National Military Command System (NMCS) to fulfill national security requirements throughout the full spectrum of conflict. It is a modern, highly survivable, command, control and communications center to direct U.S. forces, execute emergency war orders and coordinate civil authorities' activities, including national contingency plans. The E-4B is a fleet of 4 highly modified Boeing 747-200s. Due to the small fleet size, aircraft availability is of primary importance to the E-4B community and should be thoroughly considered by any prospective offerors</p>

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice
<p>FRAUD PREVENTION SYSTEM (FPS)</p>
<p>Purpose of Notice:</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE posted for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY and will be used to assist the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in determining the availability of eligible Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, HUB Zone, women-owned small business, and 8(a) with the technical capability necessary to successfully perform the requirements described herein.</p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERIVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.</p>
<p>THIS IS STRICTLY MARKET RESEARCH TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY TO OBTAIN CONTRACTOR SUPPORT SERVICES TO PERFORM THE SAME OR SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS TO THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTICE. THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE &amp; MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) MAY OR MAY NOT ISSUE A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR REQUEST FOR QUOTATION. RESPONSES TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE SHALL BE THE SUBMISSION OF A CAPABILITY STATEMENT; ACCORDINGLY, CMS WILL NOT ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS REGARDING THE RESULTS OF THE MARKET RESEARCH. THE CONTRACT IS ANTICIPATED TO BE COST PLUS AWARD FEE (CFAF). THE CONTRACTING OFFICE RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AWARD ANY OTHER TYPE OF TASK ORDER DETAILED INFORMATION IS PROVIDED VIA THE DRAFT STATEMENT OF WORK WHICH IS POSTED ON THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of qualified small businesses that can provide an IT development and data services solution in support of the CMS requirements for the FRAUD PREVENTION SYSTEM (FPS).</p>
<p>Prior to engaging in procurement activity to acquire vendors for the Fraud Prevention System potential businesses will need to demonstrate the ability to provide the services defined in this notice.</p>
<p>Background<br />The loss of taxpayer dollars through waste, fraud, and abuse drives up health care costs. CMS is pursuing an aggressive program integrity strategy that will prevent fraudulent transactions from occurring, rather than simply tracking down fraudulent providers and pursuing illegitimate claims. CMS' program integrity mission also encompasses the operations and oversight necessary to ensure that CMS makes accurate payments to legitimate providers and suppliers for appropriate, reasonable, and necessary services and supplies for eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Reversing the traditional pay- and-chase approach to detection and prevention is the main goal of the National Fraud Prevention Program, a long-term, sustainable approach that incorporates innovative technologies in integrated solutions.</p>
<p>Working with qualified vendors, CMS hopes to decrease those inefficiencies by:</p>
<p>A. Plan and execute a tailored development approach to complete design, development, testing and implementation of the predictive modeling system, and iterate with continuous refinements of the modeling system and output reports during the Base Year.</p>
<p>B. Design the system to operate using software and IT infrastructure compatible with the CMS IT environment and enterprise architecture and in accordance with the CMS system development framework and security.</p>
<p>C. Maintain CMS Authority to Operate (ATO) and/or CMS interim ATO for hosting the predictive modeling system and/or authorization using CMS data sources and business intelligence at the Contractor's facility.</p>
<p>D. Generate and coordinate delivery (daily or more frequently) output reports in the format(s) accepted for use by all stakeholders. The reports shall target preventing payment of claims identified as having high risk of fraud, waste, or abuse until claims are validated.</p>
<p>E. Continually test and refine the predictive modeling system and integrity of the results to minimize false positives, refine the taxonomy of classifications, score the issues to support prioritization and continuously improve the model and/or edit based on user feedback.</p>
<p>F. Define agreed to metrics to measure implementation results and outcomes that can be computed and reported directly from the predictive modeling system.</p>
<p>G. No later than 30 days prior to completion of each performance period, deliver a draft Summary Report addressing all findings and results of the predictive modeling system including assessment for future use, limitations, scalability, recommended areas for capability improvements, observations on any CMS data limitations, and areas for further investigation and development. Revise and submit a completed Summary Report that incorporates CMS feedback prior to the end of the Task Order.</p>
<p>H. Support users of the predictive analytic reports with any needed interpretation of finding and address user feedback. The type and level of user support shall include telephone and email support as directed by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR).</p>
<p>I. Implement a system/tool that enables review and tracking of predictive model/edit outputs and results by all CMS partners supporting enrollment, payment processing, investigations, audit, and enforcement.</p>
<p>J. Business Intelligence Reporting Tools (Dashboard) connect to the live FPS2 system and allows drill-down capabilities to claims level.</p>
<p>K. Integrate edit module in the claims authorization processing and document the change order request to permit implementation of Edits.</p>
<p>L. Incorporate the ability to suspend claims for review by the Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC)</p>
<p>Anticipated Period of Performance<br />The government expects that the final contract for this body of work will be for a base period of 12 months and four (4) twelve month option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the government.</p>

The location of all paint chip samples shall be documented on the building drawing and documented in accordance with this SOW.

2.2.2	Risk Assessment

2.2.2.1	Visual Assessment

The lead inspector/risk assessor shall perform concurrently with the lead inspection visual assessment, an assessment of all rooms and surfaces to locate potential LBP hazards and to evaluate the magnitude of each hazard. Following the floor plans or sketches, the lead inspector/risk assessor shall visually inspect the exterior and every room that will be assessed to evaluate paint and other building components with a coating that might contain lead such as ceramic tile glaze and building conditions.  Every lead containing building material and lead- based paint or coating component system with the same distinct painting or coating history (see Glossary) testing positive for lead shall be inspected for deterioration.

The lead inspector/risk assessor shall review the XRF data recorded and identify through observation:
"	Any friction surface or impact surface with visibly deteriorated paint or coating, and
"	All other lead-based paint or coating surfaces with visible deteriorated paint.
"	Visible paint and coating debris and particulate
"	Damaged or deteriorated lead containing building materials

The lead inspector/risk assessor shall visually assess  surfaces in common areas.  The lead inspector/risk assessor shall inspect deterioration on friction and impact surfaces by operating and examining the friction and/or impact surfaces of several of the windows and doors that are used most frequently (as determined by accessibility) that contain LBP.  The visual assessment shall be documented using HUD Guidelines Forms 5.0-5.7 (HUD-1539-LBP) or equivalent.  The forms shall be submitted as attachments to the Lead Inspection/Risk Assessment Report.

2.2.2.2	Sample Location Selection

The lead inspector/risk assessor shall select single surface dust wipe sample locations during the visual assessment.  Paint chip samples, as required, should be selected in concert with the lead inspection phase of the project. Chip samples of other coatings will be obtained where possible and damage is not readily observable. Sample locations for each unit shall be identified on each unit floor plan or sketch, and shall be based on visual observations, separate component systems with distinct histories, pre- assessment unit information (including physical characteristics, use patterns, previous study results), and on the following:

"	Samples shall not be collected from worn portions of the painted surfaces.
"	Friction or impact surface hazards shall be evaluated by dust wipe analysis, and accordingly shall not require paint chip or coating sampling.

a.	Dust Wipe Sample Locations

One dust sample shall be collected from interior window sills and floors in all areas representing distinct component systems.  Any lead-based paint on a friction surface with visibly deteriorated paint or that is subject to abrasion shall be sampled where the lead dust levels on the nearest horizontal surface beneath the friction surface can potentially exceed the dust-lead hazard action levels in Table A-1.

b.	Paint and Coating Chip Sample Locations

The lead inspector/risk assessor shall immediately review the results of the lead inspection, and determine if any identified lead bearing surfaces contain deteriorated paint or coating and note the extent of the damage. 

c.	Bulk/Building Material Sample Locations

The lead inspector/risk assessor shall collect a bulk/building material sample whereever XRF sampling cannot definitively delineate the lead containing material (ie. Paint, glazing, radiation shielding)


2.2.2.3	Risk Assessment Sample and Sample Location Documentation

All XRF testing locations shall be marked on the floor plans/sketches and forms at the time of actual testing during the inspection phase of the combined inspection/risk assessment.

The Risk Assessment Sample and Sample Location Documentation shall be included as an attachment to the Risk Assessment Sampling Plan following completion of the fieldwork and submitted as a part of the Lead Inspection/Risk Assessment Report.


2.2.3	Single Surface Dust Sampling

Dust samples shall be collected for analysis by single surface wipe sampling.  Dust wipe samples shall always be collected before paint and coating chip samples to avoid cross- contamination.  The lead inspector/risk assessor shall collect wipe samples in accordance with ASTM's Standard Practice for Field Collection of Settled Dust Samples Using Wipe Sampling Methods for Lead Determination by Atomic Spectrometry Techniques (E 1728), using wipe materials meeting the requirements of Standard Specification for Wipe Sampling Materials for Lead in Surface Dust (E 1792).


2.2.4	Deteriorated Paint and Coating Chip Sampling

The XRF data of this assessment shall be used to evaluate all deteriorated paint surfaces for the presence of lead.  Deteriorated painted surfaces that were not suitable for testing by XRF due to shape, or accessibility etc., or where inconclusive XRF readings were generated during the inspection phase, shall be tested destructively by chip sample collection.  The chip samples shall be collected and submitted in accordance with the laboratory's SOP for collecting paint chip samples to determine lead loading per cc of surface area, and ASTM's Standard Practice for Field Collection of Dried Paint Samples for Lead Determination by Atomic Spectrometry Techniques
(E 1729).

2.2.5	Sample Identification

Dust, paint and coating, and Bulk/Building Material samples shall be identified using unique sample numbers.  Field and laboratory blanks and spiked samples submitted to the laboratory for QA/QC purposes shall be numbered in such a way that the sample identity will not be revealed to personnel conducting the analysis.

2.2.6	Sample Chain-of-Custody

The Contractor shall follow a standard chain-of-custody protocol to ensure and document a continuous record of sample possession from sample collection to receipt by the laboratory. The Contractor shall complete and maintain chain-of-custody forms for each set of samples shipped to the laboratory, and a copy of the forms shall accompany each shipment of samples.

The Contractor shall include copies of all chain-of-custody forms completed during the assessment in the Lead Inspection/Risk Assessment Report.

2.2.7	Decontamination

Field sampling equipment shall be decontaminated following the appropriate ASTM standard. At a minimum, the field decontamination procedures for non-disposable sampling equipment (e.g., knives, coring devices, scrapers) shall consist of either wiping the equipment off twice using a clean wet wipe each time, or washing in a solution of non-phosphate detergent (e.g., Liquinox), and rinsing with distilled water. The equipment shall be decontaminated prior to each use, between each sample, and prior to leaving the site.  The Contractor shall coordinate with the installation environmental officer to determine requirements for the disposal of decontamination waste and used personal protective equipment.

2.3	TASK 3 SAMPLE DATA ANALYSIS, EVALUATION OF FINDINGS

2.3.1	XRF Data Interpretation

XRF results shall be interpreted by the Contractor in accordance with ASTM Standards, the XRF manufacturer's PCS, and as otherwise required in this SOW.

2.3.2	Sample Preparation and Analysis

Samples collected by the lead inspector/risk assessor during the assessment(s) shall be sent to a laboratory recognized by the EPA under the (National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Porgram (NLLAP) for analysis.  The laboratory must be accredited for each type of analysis required.  The Contractor shall submit copies of the laboratories NLLAP certification.

2.3.2.1	Laboratory Turnaround Time

The Contractor shall require the laboratory to report analytical results to the Contractor within 5 days of the laboratory's receipt of the samples in the laboratory.

2.3.3	Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC)

2.3.3.1	XRF Performance Validation and Verification

The lead inspector/risk assessor shall use only XRF spectrum analyzers with current, published Performance Characteristic (PCS) sheets that provide valid measurements at the levels specified in Table A-1.  A copy of the PCS for the XRF instruments used on this project shall be submitted in the Lead Inspection Sampling Plan section of the Lead Inspection/Risk Assessment Report.

The lead inspector/risk assessor shall perform calibration checks at the beginning and end of the inspection work or every four hours, whichever comes first or as otherwise specified in Chapter 7 of the HUD Guidelines: "Guidelines for the Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing, June 1995. (Chapter 7 revised 1997)". If the PCS of the XRF spectrum analyzer manufacturer requires additional or more stringent warm up, quality control, or calibration check instructions than those described in the HUD Guidelines, they shall be followed.  Calibration shall also be performed before and after turning the instrument on or off throughout the inspection work (e.g., lunch breaks, changing batteries).  If the failed calibration results occur at the end of a testing period, the results obtained during that testing period shall be discarded and the unit re-tested.  The lead inspector/risk assessor shall record all calibration check results and submit this record in the Contractor Data Certification section of the Lead Inspection/Risk Assessment Report.

Validation shall be accomplished with the lead inspector/risk assessor randomly selecting 10 testing combinations for retesting in the surveyed units for every 10 units tested or 5 tests per day, for single facility surveys.  The retesting shall be with the same XRF spectrum analyzer.  The average of the 5-10 XRF retest results shall not vary from the 5-10 original XRF results by more than the retest tolerance limit that is calculated as specified on the XRF PCS sheet.  If the limit is exceeded, the procedure shall be repeated using 5-10 different testing combinations.  If the retest tolerance is exceeded again, the original inspection is considered invalid.	This process must be documented and submitted in the Contractor Data Certification section of the Lead Inspection/Risk Assessment Report.

2.3.3.2	Field Blank Dust Wipe QA Samples

Field blanks for single wipe sampling shall be collected in accordance with ASTM's "Standard Practice for Field Collection of Settled Dust Samples Using Wipe Sampling Methods for Lead Determination by Atomic Spectrometry Techniques", (E 1728).  Wipe materials shall meet the requirements of "Standard Specification for Wipe Sampling Materials for Lead in Surface Dust", (E 1792) using the same wipe material used to collect the field wipe samples. There shall be no indication to the laboratory, by sample identification numbers or other means, that the field blank samples are QA samples.

2.3.3.3	Field Spike Dust Wipe QA Samples

The Contractor shall submit double-blind (spiked) QA dust wipe samples to the laboratory at a frequency of 2% of total samples collected, with a minimum of one sample using one of the two following options:

a.	The Contractor shall obtain commercially prepared spiked wipe samples meeting the same QA/QC requirements required in preparing spiked wipe samples used by the AIHA in its management of the Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing (ELPAT) laboratory certification program, for submittal to the laboratory. The contractor shall obtain and use wipes of the same brand and type as those used to prepare the spiked samples. The Contractor shall use these wipes to collect field samples and to prepare field blank samples.

b. The Contractor shall hire a laboratory to prepare spiked wipe samples using National Institute of Standards and Testing (NIST) traceable materials.  Spiked samples shall be prepared using leaded dust, not lead in solution. The lead concentration in the spiked wipe samples shall approximate the amount of lead in the lead action level criteria for hard floors in Table A-1 of this SOW.  The Contractor shall provide uncontaminated wipes of the same brand and lot as the wipes that will be used to collect field samples, to the laboratory preparing the spiked samples.  The laboratory shall use these wipes to prepare the spiked wipe samples. The laboratory preparing the spiked samples shall be independent of the laboratory that will be used to analyze the field samples and field QA samples.

There shall be no indication to the laboratory analyzing the field samples, by sample identification numbers or other means, that the spiked samples are QA samples.

2.3.3.4	Field Duplicate/Spike Paint Chip QA Samples

The Contractor shall submit double-blind QA paint and coating chip samples to the laboratory for analysis.  At a minimum, these shall include field duplicate samples, prepared by using standard mortar and pestle homogenizing techniques, collected at a rate of 2% of total samples collected, with a minimum of one sample.  The Contractor may also submit standard reference samples (commercially-prepared paint chip samples with a known concentration of lead) at a rate of 2% of the total samples collected, to the laboratory for analysis.  The lead concentration in the samples used shall be within 75% to 125% of the lead hazard action levels in Table A-1 if available.  There shall be no indication to the laboratory, by sample identification numbers or other means, that the samples are QA samples. The Contractor shall evaluate the results of the analyses of QA samples and include this evaluation in the final report.

2.3.4	Project Data Review and Assessment

The Contractor shall review all project data collected as part of the current assessment and verify that the data is acceptable.  Data review includes (1) Field sample collection and control review, and (2) analytical laboratory data review.  Field sample collection and control review includes evaluating the adequacy of the Lead Inspection Sampling Plan and Risk Assessment Sampling Plan throughout the performance of the assessment.

2.3.4.1	Field Dust Wipe Quality Assurance Verification

Prior to beginning field dust sampling, the Contractor shall provide the laboratory with at least one uncontaminated wipe per each container of bulk packed wipes that will be used for collecting field dust wipes, to verify that the wipe material meets the requirements of Standard Specification for Wipe Sampling Materials for Lead in Surface Dust (E 1792).  Wipes containing more than 5.0  g/wipe of background lead shall render the entire container of bulk packed wipes represented by the analyzed wipe, contaminated and disqualify the represented wipes for field use.	Pre-analysis data by the vendor is acceptable as meeting this requirement. (See AIHA web site for a listing of wipe vendors meeting ASTM Method E 1792 criteria.)

2.3.4.2	Laboratory QA and QC Verification.

a.	Evaluation of Laboratory Data

The Contractor shall obtain and review NLLAP-required QC data generated for each sample run completed under this SOW.  The QC data shall include batch QC validation data and the 95% confidence interval data (determined by the laboratory from QC charts or a QC database for each matrix, i.e., single surface dust wipe samples, deteriorated paint chip samples, soil samples) determined at concentrations equivalent to 40  g/ft2 for dust wipe samples, 0.5% by weight (5000  g/g (ppm)) for paint chip samples, and 400  g/g (ppm)) for bulk soil samples. The Contractor shall evaluate the data package to determine that the QA/QC data generated for each sample run falls within current NLLAP Laboratory Quality System Requirements (LQSR) parameters.
Spiked samples submitted to the laboratory in accordance with this SOW shall fall within 75% - 125% of the true value.


b.	Rejection of Laboratory Data

The Contractor shall not accept or use data from the laboratory that does not fall within current NLLAP LQSR parameters. If the laboratory fails to obtain spiked results within the specified error limits:

"	Two more spikes of the same matrix shall be sent immediately to the laboratory for analysis.
"	If the two additional spike samples fail, the sample batch shall be considered invalid for the matrix represented.

If laboratory data are rejected and insufficient quantities of the samples remain to allow re-analysis of the samples while adhering to QA/QC requirements, the Contractor shall collect and submit additional samples, at no cost to the Government, for laboratory analysis using NLLAP QA/QC protocols.  The Contractor shall also be responsible for any re-sampling required due to laboratory errors that result in the destruction or loss of data, or a failure to report results on any samples submitted.

2.3.4.3	Contractor Certification of Project Data Validity

The Contractor shall certify that all field data collected to determine the presence of a lead hazard were valid.

2.3.4.4	Comparison with Lead Hazard Action Levels

The Contractor shall compare the collected data and Table A-1 criteria to determine whether lead-based paint and/or lead hazards are present.  This comparison shall be documented in the Lead Inspection/Risk Assessment Report and meet the HUD guidelines for Lead-Based Paint in Target Housing.

For all lead hazard evaluations, the data shall be examined to determine if consistent patterns emerge (e.g., the window troughs contain high levels, while floors and interior sills are low); such patterns will be used in the development of recommendations for focused cost-effective control measures.

2.3.4.5	Laboratory Report

The Contractor shall require that the laboratory report information necessary for the Contractor to comply with the data evaluation/validation requirements outlined in this SOW.  The Laboratory Report shall include the following information addressing all field samples submitted to it by the Contractor excluding sample data collected by the Contractor using XRF instrumentation:

Data Quality Objective









Deteriorated paint	The qualitative and quantitative statements, guidelines, and requirements presented in paragraphs
2.2 and 2.3 of this SOW that clarify study objectives, define the appropriate type of data, and specify the tolerance levels of potential errors that will be used as the basis for establishing the quality of the data needed to support decisions.



Paint that is cracking, flaking, chipping, peeling, or otherwise separating from the substrate of a building component. (40 CFR 745.223)
Distinct painting history	The application history, as indicated by its visual appearance or a record of application, over time, of paint or other surface coatings to a component or room. (40 CFR 745.223)
Double-blind sample	For the purposes of this SOW, this refers to a QC sample (replicate, duplicate, spiked sample, etc.) that is sent to the laboratory with no indication of the possible lead content and without identifying the sample as a QC sample.

Lead-based paint (LBP)	Paint or other surface coatings that contain lead equal to or in excess of 1.0 milligrams per square centimeter or more than 0.5 percent by weight (5000  g/g or parts per million). (40 CFR 745.223). Throughout this document, "lead-based paint", "paint", and "coating" are used to cumulatively refer to substances applied to the surfaces of building materials for decorative or functional requirements or purposes.
 


Lead-based paint hazard	
Any condition that causes exposure to lead from dust- lead hazards, soil-lead hazards, or lead-based paint that is deteriorated or present in chewable surfaces, friction surfaces, or impact surfaces, and that would result in adverse human health effects. (40 CFR Part 745)
Lead-based paint inspection	A surface-by-surface investigation to determine the presence of lead-based paint and coating and the provision of a report explaining the results of the investigation.  (40 CFR Part 745)

The aim is to provide quality that is satisfactory, adequate, dependable, and economical.  (NLLAP LQSR)



Random Sampling	A technique for selecting a sample of n elements from a population of elements in such a way that each combination of n elements has the same probability of being selected. In statistical sampling, the process of selecting sample units in such a way that all units under consideration have the same probability of being selected. (ASTM E1605)
Rinsate Blank	A sample of "used" cleaning fluid rinse solution, also called equipment blank.  The rinsate blank is used in rinsing collection equipment to monitor possible cross contamination.	(EPA, 757-R-92-006, May 1993)
Risk assessment	An on-site investigation and report to determine the existence, nature, severity, and location of lead-based paint hazards. The provision of a report by the individual or the firm conducting the risk assessment, explaining the results of the investigation and options for reducing lead-based paint hazards. (40 CFR 745.223)
Room equivalent	A room equivalent is an identifiable part of a residence, such as a room, a house exterior, a foyer, staircase, hallway, or an exterior area (exterior areas contain items such as play areas, painted swing sets, painted sandboxes, etc.).  For multifamily units or apartment buildings, common areas and exterior sites are treated as separate types of units, not as room equivalents (HUD Guidelines, Chapter 7, current Revision).
Substrate	The substrate is the material underneath the paint or coating. Substrates should be classified into one of six types: brick, concrete, drywall, metal, plaster, or wood. These substrates cover almost all-building materials that are painted and are linked to those used in the XRF performance characteristic sheets.( HUD Guidelines, Chapter 7, current Revision)

Suspect Building Material	Building materials which brands or manufacturers are known contain lead or which have coatings or glazings that have been known to contain lead or lead paints.

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address: </strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institutes on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions,
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>This is a <strong>Small Business Sources Sought </strong>notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Background: </strong>NCATS is a translational science center that prides itself on its tremendously productive pipeline and is innovative in a number of ways.  First, our quantitative high throughput screening (qHTS) paradigm, which tests all compounds at multiple concentrations in the primary screen, is unique.  However, more and more academic and pharmaceutical groups are now adopting it in their own operations due to the enhanced data generation that enable compound bioactivity assessment and probe production efficiency.  This efficiency derives not only from savings in post-screen cherry-picking, reconfirmation, dose-response testing, and initial SAR assessment, but also from the ability to perform reliable "virtual counter screens," thus allowing us to make more informed decisions on which scaffolds to pursue for probe development.  Second, the NCATS is distinctive in its focus on collaboration with outside investigators to produce high-quality chemical probes to define new biology.  This focus is reflected in our unprecedented Outreach program, which reaches hundreds of potential new investigators every year, and accounts for much of the new science being done at the NCATS.  Third, the NCATS is uniquely focused on new technologies and paradigms to improve the process of probe development, typified by qHTS, our informatics platform, our utilization of structural biology to accelerate probe development, development of new synthetic and analytical chemistry paradigms.</p>
<p>As such, NCATS is working towards assembling new, high quality, focused, and well annotated small molecule libraries.  The compounds requested would be essential for our chemical libraries.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose and Objectives: </strong>The purpose of this potential procurement is the acquisition of four (4) small molecule compounds to expand on NCATS chemical library available for high throughput screening.</p>
<p><strong>Project requirements: <br /></strong>The contractor shall provide the following small molecules in the stated concentrations:</p>
<p>1. CG-1021 - 50 mg<br />2. CG-965 - 25 mg<br />3. CG-1265 - 25 mg<br />4. CG-1280 - 5 g</p>
<p>Compounds need to be &gt;95% purity as characterized by using HPLC, LCMS, and NMR.</p>
<p>The contractor is responsible for shipment of the small molecules to NCATS within 20 business days after receipt of award.</p>
<p><strong>Capability statement /information sought: </strong>Interested organizations must provide clear and convincing documentation of their capability of providing the item(s) specified in this notice.

<p class="p4">Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center, Acquisition Management Services, 12501 Ardennes Avenue, Suite 400, Rockville, MD, 20857, United States.</p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p class="p4">This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p class="p4">The Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) plans to conduct a rigorous evaluation of the new grants that will be awarded under the extension of the Health Profession Opportunity Grants (HPOG) program.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">HPOG was first established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 to fund education and training programs in high-demand, healthcare professions that are targeted to TANF recipients and other low-income individuals. In 2010, ACF awarded five-year grants to 32 HPOG grantees in 23 states. Current HPOG grantees are post-secondary educational institutions, workforce investment boards (WIBs), state or local government agencies, and community-based organizations. Five grantees are tribal organizations. HPOG grantees are required to carry out their projects in coordination with the State TANF agency, relevant local and State WIBs, and the State apprenticeship agency. Further, the demonstrations are expected to: (1) target skills and competencies demanded by the healthcare industry; (2) support career pathways, such as an articulated career ladder; (3) result in an employer- or industry-recognized certificate or degree (which can include a license, as well as a Registered Apprenticeship certificate or degree); (4) combine supportive services with education and training services to help participants overcome barriers to employment, as necessary; and (5) provide training services at times and locations that are easily accessible to targeted populations.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">HPOG&rsquo;s authorizing legislation called for evaluation activities to demonstrate whether and how the program meets its goals. OPRE is using a multi-pronged evaluation strategy to assess the success of the HPOG programs funded in 2010. The research and evaluation activities aim to provide information on program implementation, systems change, outcomes, and impact. The current ACF career pathways portfolio includes seven complex and inter-related research and evaluation projects. For more information on these projects, see&nbsp; HYPERLINK "http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/research/project/evaluation-portfolio-for-the-health-profession-opportunity-grants-hpog" <span class="s2">http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/opre/research/project/evaluation-portfolio-for-the-health-profession-opportunity-grants-hpog</span>.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">ACF has announced plans for a competition to award new program grants in FY 2015 for a five-year project period, with the understanding that subsequent awards in years two through five of the project will be contingent on the availability of funding. In this announcement, ACF indicated they expect to award approximately 35 grants to grantees serving TANF recipients and other low-income individuals, and approximately five grants to tribes, tribal organizations or tribal colleges or universities. For the forecast announcements for this competition, see&nbsp; HYPERLINK "http://www.acf.hhs.gov/hhsgrantsforecast/index.cfm?switch=grant.view&amp;gff_grants_forecastInfoID=70680" <span class="s2">http://www.acf.hhs.gov/hhsgrantsforecast/index.cfm?switch=grant.view&amp;gff_grants_forecastInfoID=70680</span> and&nbsp; HYPERLINK "http://www.acf.hhs.gov/hhsgrantsforecast/index.cfm?switch=grant.view&amp;gff_grants_forecastInfoID=70681" <span class="s2">http://www.acf.hhs.gov/hhsgrantsforecast/index.cfm?switch=grant.view&amp;gff_grants_forecastInfoID=70681</span>.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">OPRE plans to rigorously evaluate the new demonstration programs to be funded by the grants awarded under the extension of the HPOG program in order to expand the career pathways evidence base and to build on what has been learned to date about how to design and implement successful career pathways programs for low-income and low-skilled individuals, and improve the outcomes of individuals who participate in these programs.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">A contract is currently in place to design a rigorous evaluation of the estimated 35 grants to be awarded to entities serving TANF recipients and other low-income individuals. This evaluation will use random assignment at the individual level in all awarded grantee sites, and may involve randomization of program components at the grantee or program site level in a subset of sites, to answer research questions such as:</p>
<p class="p4">How are health professions training programs being implemented across the grantee sites?</p>
<p class="p4">What changes to the service delivery system are associated with program implementation?</p>
<p class="p4">What individual-level outputs and outcomes occur (e.g., recruitment, enrollment, retention, completion [accreditation/ certification], job entry, employment retention and advancement, and earnings)?</p>
<p class="p4">What are the impacts (e.g., educational attainment and earnings) of HPOG programs on their populations of interest?&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">How do effects of career pathways programs vary over time, across outcomes or domains, by occupation, or by participant characteristics?</p>
<p class="p4">What key components or approaches are successful or contribute to the success of these programs?</p>
<p class="p4">Do different program models, strategies, or components lead to different impacts for participants?</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">Additionally, this contract is responsible for defining uniform data collection requirements that the HPOG grantees must adhere to in order to track activities, outputs, and outcomes, and for designing, building, and maintaining a web-based data system into which this data will be entered. The system will be used by all grantees for program management and to inform continuous quality improvement efforts, and by ACF for performance monitoring and research and evaluation purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Purpose and Objectives:</strong></p>
<p class="p4">Under a new project, OPRE intends to build on and add to the knowledge generated in the current ORPE career pathways research and evaluation portfolio, as well as other similar studies that have been conducted.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">Specifically, under this project OPRE intends to complete the following key tasks: (1) conduct&nbsp; an impact evaluation of new HPOG programs; (2) design and conduct a coordinating comprehensive implementation evaluation of the estimated 35 grantees; (3) design and conduct an evaluation of the estimated 5 Tribal HPOG grantees; (4) design and conduct cost benefit analyses of all awarded HPOG grants; (5) design and conduct follow-up studies at 36 months with grantees participating in the impact study to rigorously evaluate the longer-term effectiveness of the HPOG grants; (6) consult experts, as needed, to provide specialized advice and guidance on any aspect of the work conducted under this project; (7) generate and release a series of briefs, reports, and other products to disseminate findings to a wide range of stakeholders; and (8) manage the project and ensure that all work is of highest quality, on time and within budget.</p>
<p class="p2"><strong></strong></p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Project Requirements:</strong></p>
<p class="p4">In order to successfully complete the key tasks outlined above, the following sub-tasks/deliverables&mdash;and the requisite skills, expertise, and corporate and staff capacity to engage in and successfully complete these subtasks/deliverables&mdash;are required:</p>
<p class="p4">Conduct the impact evaluation designed for the estimated 35 grantees serving TANF recipients and other low-income individuals:</p>
<p class="p4">Develop, field test, and obtain both IRB approval and OMB clearance for research-based, valid and reliable data collection instruments for the impact study. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">Establish program/site selection criteria for the random assignment of program components, and randomly assign components accordingly. Work with selected sites to set up the implementation and experimental test of the assigned component(s).&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">Develop Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for each site in the evaluation that specifies the intervention and, for a subset of sites, program component to be tested along with performance plans and benchmarks, and addresses the payment of funds to sites to help offset the costs of participating in a rigorous evaluation.</p>
<p class="p4">Provide technical guidance to help the HPOG grantees meet evaluation requirements.</p>
<p class="p4">Monitor the completeness and quality of baseline data being collected through the uniform data system; collect follow-up data using the approved survey, obtaining at least an 80 percent response rate at each site.</p>
<p class="p4">Develop an analysis plan for the study that includes: the study logic model and research questions; a narrative discussion of the measures and analytic techniques to be utilized in answering each research question; relative advantages or disadvantages of approaches or methods; and, for each data source, the specific types of data analyses that will be employed.</p>
<p class="p4">Conduct an impact analysis based on survey and administrative data.</p>
<p class="p4">Produce and secure data files and documentation including public use or restricted use files.</p>
<p class="p4">Contractors should have the organizational capacity, capability and relevant prior experience to conduct a multi-site, large-scale experimental evaluation involving different populations in a variety of settings. Contractors should have the capacity, capability and relevant experience to work simultaneously with geographically dispersed programs and provide technical guidance and manage large volumes of data for approximately 40 evaluation sites at the same time. In addition, this project will require the availability of adequate computer/statistical resources and the institutional capability to process and analyze a large volume of data, including capacity to input data, clean data, and conduct quality control checks.</p>
<p class="p4">Design and conduct a coordinating comprehensive implementation evaluation of the estimated 35 grantees:</p>
<p class="p4">Design a state-of-the-art implementation evaluation which may include, but is not limited to: site visits, onsite observations, time studies, case studies, and other state<span class="s3">&#8208;</span>of<span class="s3">&#8208;</span>the art methods.</p>
<p class="p4">Develop, field test, and obtain both IRB approval and OMB clearance for research-based, valid and reliable data collection instruments for the implementation study, including protocols for the assessment of program implementation.</p>
<p class="p4">Design and execute an evaluation of the estimated 5 Tribal HPOG grantees:</p>
<p class="p4">To inform the evaluation design, engage in knowledge development tasks regarding diverse programmatic approaches to health professions training programs serving tribal populations; incorporate stakeholder input, including but not limited to input from tribal leadership and/or elected officials and other local stakeholders.</p>
<p class="p4">Create and execute a feasibility assessment for individual Tribal HPOG grantee(s) participation in the impact study (described under subtask 1 above), if any tribal grantee(s) indicates an interest in participating in random assignment. Any Tribal HPOG program that does not participate in the random assignment evaluation will automatically be part of the separate Tribal HPOG evaluation design and conducted under this subtask.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">Design a comprehensive implementation and outcome evaluation of the Tribal HPOG programs that will:</p>
<p class="p4">Provide an in-depth, systematic analysis of program implementation, operations, and outputs and outcomes in all the sites served by the grantees; and</p>
<p class="p4">Compare implementation, operations, and output and outcomes data within and across sites to examine correlations and patterns and generate hypotheses about the effectiveness of different program approaches for tribal populations.</p>
<p class="p4">Develop, field test, and obtain both IRB approval (including tribal IRB, if applicable) and OMB clearance for rigorous and culturally appropriate data collection instruments. Comply with any tribally established cultural protocols for evaluation and research.</p>
<p class="p4">Conduct the comprehensive implementation and outcome evaluation and analyze findings.</p>
<p class="p4">Provide technical assistance to help grantees meet the evaluation requirements and build local capacity to engage in and apply research. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">In collaboration with tribal leadership and/or authorized designee(s), design a dissemination plan to disseminate findings from the Tribal HPOG evaluation. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">Produce and secure data files and documentation including public use or restricted use files.</p>
<p class="p4">Contractors and/or subcontractors conducting this evaluation should have the capability, relevant prior experience, and expertise to conduct research with tribal communities.</p>
<p class="p4">Design and conduct cost benefit analyses of the HPOG grants:</p>
<p class="p4">Develop measures and information collection protocols as necessary, obtain both IRB approval and OMB clearance, and conduct the analyses.</p>
<p class="p4">Design and conduct follow-up studies to rigorously evaluate the longer-term effectiveness of the HPOG grants:</p>
<p class="p4">Design measures, information collection protocols, and instruments to examine longer term impacts at 36 months after random assignment. Obtain both IRB approval and OMB clearance, and conduct the additional follow<span class="s3">&#8208;</span>up and analyses.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">Consult experts, as needed, to provide specialized advice and guidance:</p>
<p class="p4">As needed, identify experts with expertise in research methodology, programs and populations similar to those being employed or served in HPOG (e.g., TANF, health professions, career ladder programs, sector<span class="s3">&#8208;</span>based employment strategies), health sector demand issues, relevant outcome measures and methods of measurement,&nbsp; analyses issues, and research in tribal communities. Secure agreements with experts for consultation.</p>
<p class="p4">Prepare any materials needed for the consultations, and draft written summaries of information learned from the consultations and how it will be applied to project tasks.</p>
<p class="p4">Generate and release a series of briefs, reports, and other products to disseminate findings to a wide range of stakeholders including practitioners, researchers, and policymakers:</p>
<p class="p4">Design a dissemination plan to disseminate findings from the impact and implementation studies to appropriate stakeholders. This may include draft, interim and final reports following periods of data collection, briefings to ACF and other relevant policy officials, conference presentations, working papers, scholarly journal articles, reports on special topics, and research/issue briefs.</p>
<p class="p4">Overall program management:</p>
<p class="p4">Staff managing and involved in the project should have the technical qualifications and academic, professional, and technical experience to successfully complete the requirements of the project and ensure that all work is of highest quality, on time and within budget. Staff should have the relevant experience in:</p>
<p class="p4">Relevant topical areas (e.g., TANF, health professions, education and training programs for TANF and low income individuals, career pathways programs, sector-based employment strategies), technical requirements (e.g., evaluation design and approach, including in experimental evaluation strategies), and management requirements (e.g., relevant experience with direct management of large teams, including subcontractors, on complex project and contract oversight responsibilities).</p>
<p class="p4">Innovative and rigorous evaluation design of complex human service and education systems.</p>
<p class="p4">Assessing the suitability of demonstration programs for different types of evaluation.</p>
<p class="p4">Conducting complex analyses utilizing state-of-the-art statistical techniques to assess net impacts across programs and among sub-groups.</p>
<p class="p4">Managing projects of similar scope and complexity.</p>
<p class="p4">Working collaboratively and successfully with other research teams, program administrators and staff, representing diverse fields and programs, and other stakeholders in carrying out the kinds of tasks as required for this project.</p>
<p class="p4">Conducting research in tribal communities; this requirement can be fulfilled via subcontract if necessary.</p>
<p class="p4">Robust management and communication structures must be established that account for the complexity of the project and need to coordinate with a range of stakeholders.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Anticipated Period of Performance:</strong></p>
<p class="p4">It is anticipated that this project would start when the new HPOG grants are awarded (by September 30, 2015). Taking options into account, including those pertaining to the long-term follow-up studies, this project will likely extend through September 29, 2025.</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4"><strong>Other Important Considerations:</strong></p>
<p class="p4">The proposed project is large and complex in scope, and will require extensive coordination among a large project team, approximately 40 grantees, and the federal government. Further, the project will be expected to coordinate with contractors involved with other OPRE-sponsored HPOG and career pathways related projects to assure consistency, avoid duplicative efforts, and promote cross project learning. Coordination with the broader research and practice field and other federal agencies engaged in career pathways initiatives is also expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="p4">The HPOG program was initially funded by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and the requirement to demonstrate whether and how the program meets its goals is authorized by the Act. Therefore ACF has invested significant resources in implementing a comprehensive, multi-faceted and rigorous evaluation approach to assess the implementation, outcomes and impacts of the HPOG program. ACF intends to expand upon this portfolio with its rigorous evaluation of the new grants to be awarded under the extension of the HPOG program. Given ACF&rsquo;s significant investment in the program and its evaluation, it is of the utmost importance that work conducted under this project is rigorous, timely, and of high quality.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Japan Engineer District (JED) is performing a market survey for a Design-Build (D-B) Construction Project titled: FY14 ECIP P311 Energy-Steam Decentralization, CFA, Sasebo, Japan.  This announcement constitutes a market survey that is being conducted for planning purposes only and the information received will assist the Government in developing an acquisition method for this project.  This notice does not constitute a commitment by the Government for any follow-on announcements, solicitation, or award.   <br>  <br> Pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10, Market Research, the purpose of this notice is to identify sources capable of satisfying the Government's requirement.  This survey seeks qualified and capable contractors to submit responses to this notice in order to adequately plan the acquisition.  If your company would like to be considered as a potential source for this work, please submit a response adhering to the below submission requirements.             <br>  <br> PROJECT DESCRIPTION <br>  <br> Project Title: FY14 ECIP P311 Energy-Steam Decentralization, CFA, Sasebo, Japan <br> Project Location: Main Base, Commander Fleet Activities, Sasebo, Japan <br> North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238220 <br> Project price magnitude is between 1,000,000,000 YEN and 2,500,000,000 YEN (utilizing a 100 YEN to 1 U.S. dollar rate)   <br>  <br> This project will replace existing steam consuming domestic hot water and space heating equipment with electrically driven heat pump systems in 30 buildings located at Commander, U.S. Fleet Activities Sasebo (CFAS).  In two (2) of the buildings, steam consuming absorption chillers will be replaced with winter space heating and summer space cooling heat pump systems.  When the installation of the heat pump heating/cooling systems have been completed, two (2) central steam plants, including the fuel oil storage tanks at each site, will be demolished.  The existing exterior steam distribution system will be blind flanged, secured at finished grade, and abandoned in place.  Within the 30 facilities to be upgraded, steam system components that are not reused may be removed or secured and abandoned in place, depending on feasibility, accessibility, and/or operability, in coordination with the new system.  To the maximum extent possible, building infrastructure (hot water tanks, supply and return headers, piping, valves, etc) will be retained and re-used in the proposed heat pump systems.  Where existing facilities or processes require steam and cannot reasonably be converted to a non-steam system, new electric steam boilers will be provided.  This project will restore any interior surface affected by the installation of the heat pump heating/cooling systems.  Restoration may include ceiling, wall, and roofing repairs, furring to accommodate mechanical piping and electrical wiring.  New space heating and cooling equipment will communicate via direct digital controls (DDC) over existing Lon Works communication infrastructure.  Lon Works Network Services (LNS) will be used for all network management including addressing and building of network variables.  Control sequence logic will reside in DDC hardward in the building.  The building control network will not be dependent upon connection to a Utility Monitoring and Control System (UMCS) for performance of control.  Electrical utility upgrades to individual facilities may include new increased capacity electrical feeders, upgraded transformers, and service panel retrofits, as necessary to accommodate the increase in electrical load resulting from the installation of the proposed heat pump systems.  Anti-Terrorism Force Protection (ATFP) work includes isolation dampers for building duct systems that are renovated under the project.  Operations and maintenance support manuals and on site operational instruction for new systems will be provided. <br>  <br> This market survey is intended for local sources only.  Local sources are those sources physically located and licensed to conduct business in Japan.  Firms interested and capable of performing this work are highly encouraged to submit a response.  <br>  <br>  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR RESPONSES TO THIS MARKET SURVEY <br>  <br> In order to adequately plan for this project's procurement, the Government requests the following information from interested firms: <br>  <br> (1) Name of your company, address, phone number, email, and point of contact. <br> (2) A statement of intent from your company, that should this project be formally solicited, you will submit a price proposal.  <br> (3) Statement of capability from your company, identifying applicable skills, experience, knowledge, past performance, and equipment required to perform this project.  Limit this statement of capability to no more than two (2) pages in length.   <br> (4) Identify and discuss your current construction bonding level per contract and aggregate contracting bonding level. <br>  <br> One of our primary goals as a construction agent for Japan is to better understand the marketplace and your submission for this sources sought will help us understand your concerns as it relates to this project.  The type of solicitation issued and the manner of advertisement may depend on the responses to this market survey.   <br>  <br> Please send your responses via email to the following Point of Contact(s):  <br>  <br> Mr. Jiro Miyairi at Jiro.Miyairi.ln@usace.army.mil  <br> Mr. Theodore Turney at Theodore.T.Turney.civ@usace.army.mil.   <br>  <br> Contracting Office Address: <br> USACE District, Japan, Attn: CECT-POJ Unit 45010, APO, AP 96338-5010  <br>  <br> All responses must be received before March 9, 2015 at 04:00 p.m. Japan Standard Time.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, New England District is issuing this Sources Sought Announcement for a construction project for Design and Build of a 66 room, 25,000sf Dormitory at the Hanscom Air Force Base (HAFB), Bedford, MA to determine interest, availability and capability of HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned and Small Business concerns.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 236220.  Design Work is expected to begin in January 2016 with construction commencing about 9 months after the start of design (i.e., 10/1/2016). All work, including site work and existing dorm demolition, is targeted to be completed by April 1st 2018.  The estimated construction cost is between $10,000,000 and $15,000,000. <br>  <br> Existing E1-E4 Airmen dormitories at the HAFB, Buildings 1510 and 1511, are rapidly deteriorating and require immediate replacement. Building 1510 and 1511 will be demolished as part of this project scope. The new dormitory will be a 3-story facility with 66 total bedrooms approximately 25,000sf. <br>  <br> The current building design includes standard spread footings founded on rammed aggregate piers due to mixed, loose soils, with a traditional slab-on grade first floor slab. The proposed building superstructure will be load-bearing, reinforced, cast-in-place, insulated concrete exterior walls. Exterior wall finishes will be a combination of masonry veneer at the lower level and EIFS above. The roof will be a light-gauge metal frame carrying a sloped, standing-seam metal roof assembly with full perimeter gutters. The dormitory will have a full-coverage wet fire suppression system. The plumbing system will require standard construction techniques but will include water-saving fixtures for LEED compliance. There will be no site irrigation. Domestic hot water will be provided by a packaged solar hot water heating system with a natural gas backup. Space heating will be provided by fan coil units with VAV boxes. Chilled water for fan units will be provided by central air cooled chillers. Heating hot water for fan coil units and other terminal heating equipment will be provided by central high efficiency gas fired boilers. Some high load interior spaces may be cooled by electric DX air handling equipment. Ventilation air will be provided by a central energy recovery system and ducted to each fan coil unit. Electrical systems will include Hanscom standard power, communications and alarms. No dedicated emergency power will be required.  <br>  <br> The orientation of the building will be north-south such that the living quarters on either side of the central linear corridor will give all bedrooms and unit living areas partial access to day lighting (either morning or afternoon).  The dormitory entry and common areas will be located at the south end of the building, to the north side of the access road to building 1548 (Fitness Center), convenient to parking and recreational fields.  The dormitory will reuse, with new striping and handicap spaces, the existing parking lot to the east while maintaining current traffic patterns and does not add significant paving area or other impermeable surfaces. <br>  <br> The design and construction will comply with multiple Air Force and DoD reference standards which include: Air Force Unaccompanied Housing Design Guide for E-1 - E-4 Airmen, the Hanscom Air Force Base Master Plan, the Hanscom Air Force Base Architectural Design Compatibility Standards, and the DoD ATFP Standards.   The facility will be LEED Silver certified.  <br>  <br> Interested firms should submit a complete capabilities package to include, at the minimum, the following:  business classification (i.e. small business) as well as demonstrating qualifications and experience with performing at least 3 projects involving design and construction of vertical structures of similar size and complexity within the last 10 years as well as relevant experience of the firm's current Project Managers, Superintendents, and other critical staff members.

<DESC>Introduction

This Request for Information (RFI) is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation nor does it restrict the Government as to the ultimate acquisition approach.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of a competitive process.  

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) is seeking potential sources to enter into a contract for Live Streaming Conference Support.

The purpose of this RFI is to identify qualified contractors who are able to meet VA's requirements, determine if commercial items are available or could be modified to meet VA's requirements, determine the appropriate contract type i.e., firm fixed-price or cost-reimbursement or time and material, understand commercial pricing practices and other market information readily available.

This conference is held at an off-site location which limits the amount of attendees.  The Live Streaming Conference Support project will utilize available tools that will enable the VA TAC to improve attendance through live streaming of the event through a website. The VA will capture the video via Cisco TelePresence TC7 Model 800-36554-01 (SX20) via H323 or SIP. This can be sent directly to the vendor using IP or through the VA Cisco VCS expressway.

The off-site venue will provide a wired connection with at least 10Mbps/10Mbps bandwidth.

*Please address whether a temporary data connection can be coordinated to provide the vendors minimum bandwidth requirements. Please address the cost in the ROM.

Requirements

A live-streaming solution that will accept the video feed and allow for 1,000 online viewers of the event.  

The live-streaming solution shall be viewable via Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Chrome browsers.  Viewers shall not be required to download client software.

The live-streaming solution shall require viewer registration (Name, Company) to provide for viewer accountability prior to the event.  Additionally, if the event link is forwarded to another participant, they shall be required to register.  Registration form fields shall be customizable.


The live-streaming solution shall provide a method for collecting questions from online viewers. 
Contractor shall provide Tier 1 Help Desk Service for virtual users having issues accessing the live-stream.

After the event has concluded, the stream shall be available for 60 days.

***Please address whether or not the following requirement is feasible, if so please address in the ROM:

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>However, all interest and capability statements must be received by the Government no later than 02/16/2015, at 6:00 PM PST to be considered.</p>

The FNLCR partners with university, government, and corporate scientists to speed the translation of laboratory research into new diagnostic tests and treatments for cancer and AIDS. FNLCR is a multi-program laboratory currently operated by Leidos Biomedical Research Inc. for the National Cancer Institute (NCI) under Prime Contract No. HHSN261200800001E, which provides Operations and Technical Support (OTS) for the Frederick National Lab.<br />The Government assumes no liability for reimbursement for any effort or associated costs to respond, nor for any information provided as a result of this notice as no information is being requested. Please be advised that any submissions provided despite the aforementioned notice that no information is requested become Government property and will not be returned, nor will there be any ensuing discussions or debriefings of any responses.<br />Responses submitted to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract. It is the responsibility of the interested parties to monitor this site and any sites referenced herein for additional information pertaining to business opportunities with the FNLCR, if any.<br />The solicitation referenced below is issued by Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. (Leidos Biomed), a wholly owned subsidiary of Leidos Corporation under its prime contract with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at Frederick.<br />Leidos Biomed is the Operations and Technical Support Contractor for the operation of the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) under contract from the National Cancer Institute (NCI).  Leidos Biomed is responsible for managing the scientific and administrative aspects of the FNLCR's research endeavors.<br />Title: Genome Characterization Centers (GCC)<br />Project Background and Objectives: Cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease in which mutations and other genomic and epigenomic abnormalities play a role in both its initiation and progression.  Given cancer's complexity, it is generally believed that only a fraction of alterations that may be useful as characteristic markers of specific tumor types and/or potential molecular targets have been identified to date.  <br />In 2006, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) collaborated to initiate The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project to determine the feasibility of more comprehensively cataloging the genomic alterations associated with a number of different human cancers. The project demonstrated that cancer-associated genes and genomic regions can be identified by combining diverse information from genome analyses with tumor biology and clinical data, and that the sequencing of selected regions can be conducted efficiently and cost-effectively. The comprehensiveness and rate of progress of TCGA depended on both optimization of technical issues and resource availability.<br />Three key "lessons learned" during the TCGA Program were that, to be able to interpret the results generated by the various characterization platform, the Centers had to a) utilize high quality molecular analytes isolated from well characterized tissue specimens, b) perform experiments utilizing strictly standardized protocols and c) deposit the results in structured and well-described formats.  The last lesson strongly impacted on the ability of the various analytical groups to extract meaningful results from the genomic data generated.<br />The overarching goal for the GCCs is the high-resolution, systematic, comprehensive (genome-wide) characterization of cancer-related genomic alterations. These types of characterization should be conducted using validated methods in a high-throughput fashion at the start of the project. The cancer biospecimens for these studies (DNA, RNA, cells [for epigenetic studies of histone modifications] or other types of samples required by a platform) will be provided by the Biospecimen Core Resource of the Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG).  The aim is to have all the characterizations conducted on biomolecules from the same biospecimens for optimal analytical integration for data comparability.  The GCCs are expected to generate these genomic data by using optimized and standardized high-throughput technologies. Based on this premise, tumor sample eligibility for CCG projects will be based on the analyte quantity and quality requirements of the technologies, which will be centrally verified by the BCR, but may include any histopathological type of tumor.<br />Contact Details: For a copy of the Solicitation please contact:<br />Jessica Staley at Jessica.staley@fnlcr.nih.gov or 301-228-4796<br />For information concerning other opportunities with the FNLCR, please refer to: http://ncioa.cancer.gov/oa-internet/sbo/welcome.jsp</p>

<p>Requirement<br />The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) and Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) Arkansas Regional Laboratory (ARL), Nanotechnology Core Facility requires a Low Voltage Hybrid Tabletop Electron Microscope, Accessory Options, and multiple one-year post-warranty Maintenance and Repair Service Agreement.</p>
<p>Background<br />The FDA Nanotechnology Core Facility supports the nanotechnology needs of NCTR and the ARL of the ORA, which are co-located on the Jefferson Laboratories Campus. The facility also supports studies conducted under the National Toxicology Program and other FDA Centers. The Nanotechnology Core Facility requires a small (tabletop) low voltage hybrid electron microscope capable of combined imaging modes of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM).</p>
<p>This microscope will be part of the "core" equipment in the Nanotechnology Core Facility and shall provide the necessary imaging conditions for very low density (soft) samples like small nanoparticles (&lt; 5 nm) and nanotubes that are difficult to image with a standard electron microscope.</p>
<p>Standard electron microscopes operate at high voltages of 60,000-120,000 V, which are too high to interact with very low density (soft) samples. Interaction is necessary for imaging; the high voltage beam shoots through the sample without interaction and causes the sample images to be washed out with very low contrast and very little structural resolution. A hybrid microscope with electrons at lower power (5,000-25,000V) produces lower energies allowing the beam to interact more completely with the sample and thus produce a better image.</p>
<p>Minimum Technical Specifications:<br />1. The system shall be capable of operating in SEM, TEM, and STEM imaging modes. <br />2. The system shall have a Field Emission Gun (FEG) as the electron source for imaging.<br />3. The FEG electron source shall be capable of operating at 7 kV or less (higher maximum voltages are allowed up to and including 30 kV.<br />4. Shall have a resolution limit of 1.3 nm or less for proposed equipment with maximum voltages less than 10 kV and 1 nm or less for proposed equipment with maximum operating voltages above 10 kV.<br />5. The resolution specifications shall be achievable in the proposed government workspace based on previous fields analysis provided by the government either as a stand-alone system or with remediation options provided by the vendor and included as an optional line item.<br />6. Due to limited approved workspace the instrument shall have a small footprint for tabletop use.<br />7. Shall be capable of using standard 120 VAC power or 208 VAC power. If neither of these voltages are compatible, then the necessary converters required to work with the in-house power shall be included.<br />8. Software for system operation shall run on a Windows 7 operating system or Windows 7 compatible system.<br />9. Shall include on-site training by a company representative with expertise in applications of the instrumentation, expected to be 5 business days.<br />10. Shall include training for up to 3 FDA personnel at a manufacturer's training site (training course expenses covered by manufacturer; travel expenses covered by the government).<br />11. Shall include a standard commercial warranty that covers instrument parts and labor to maintain operation, and any and all computer and software that are required for operation and image processing.</p>
<p><br />Mimimum Post-Warranty Maintenance and Repair Service Requirements<br />The Government requires post-warranty service and maintenance services as detailed below for four (4) years via multiple option periods that the Government may exercise on a unilateral basis. <br />&bull; At least one on-site Preventive Maintenance (PM) visit per year<br />&bull; Shall include unlimited technical support (e.g., telephone-based, email-based, website-based, etc.), Mondays - Fridays (excluding Federal Holidays) between the hours of 7:00 AM - 5:00 PM Central Time. <br />&bull; Shall include unlimited software and firmware updates<br />&bull; All Preventive Maintenance and repairs shall be performed on-site by formally trained and certified technicians/engineers, following Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specifications, manuals, and service bulletins, using OEM replacement parts, components, subassemblies, etc.<br />&bull; All maintenance pricing shall be inclusive of labor, travel, replacement parts, components, subassemblies, etc.<br />&bull; Maintenance agreement shall include a 24 hour or less plan of action on any problems reported by the government to the vendor requiring on-site repairs, including estimated time of arrival of a service personnel needed to perform the necessary repairs and an estimated time for completion of service.<br />&bull; Service Records and Reports:<br />The Contractor shall, commensurate with the completion of each service call or preventative maintenance visit, provide the end-user of the equipment and the Contracting Officer with a copy of a field service report/ticket identifying the equipment name, manufacturer, model number, and serial number of the equipment being serviced/repaired and detailing the reason for the service call, a detailed description of the work performed, the test instruments or other equipment used to affect the repair or otherwise perform the service, the name(s) and contact information of the technician who performed the repair/service, and for information purposes, the on-site hours expended and parts/components replaced.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments.

In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.(End of clause)<br />1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. (End of clause)<br />1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. <br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.<br /></span><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 8.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">1352.239-70 SOFTWARE LICENSE ADDENDUM (APR 2010) - <br />(a) This Addendum incorporates certain terms and conditions relating to Federal procurement actions.

This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>ALL INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO SUBMIT A STANDARD FORM (SF) 330, ARCHITECT-ENGINEER QUALIFICATIONS, IS CONTAINED HEREIN. THERE IS NO SEPARATE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) PACKAGE TO DOWNLOAD. This is a total Small Business Set-Aside.
<p>Architect-Engineer (A-E) services are required for a firm fixed-price Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract for Structural Engineering Services. The work for this contract shall occur at various Navy and Marine Corps facilities and other military installations located in the NAVFAC Southwest Area of Responsibility (AOR): California, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The preponderance of work will be in Southern and Central California. The Offeror/Contractor must demonstrate adequate in-house staffing capable to self-perform at least 50 percent of the cost of the contract as required by FAR Clause 52.219-14 (b)(1) Limitation on Subcontracting.</p>
<p>A-E Design and Engineering Services shall mainly provide for, but not be limited to, STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING related facilities. Structural engineering services may involve many types of buildings and structures of various sizes and configurations, as well as high bay structures, long span structures, containment vessels (tanks), weight handling equipment, retaining structures, towers, and bridges.</p>
<p>Primary Structural Engineering A-E services are required for preparing: Requests for Proposals (RFP) packages for Design-Build projects; fully designed plans and specifications; structural investigations, studies, evaluations, and recommendations for upgrade of existing facilities; antiterrorism design related to analysis of blast effects and design to prevent progressive collapse; innovative structural system design including seismic base isolation, seismic damping, passive dissipating systems and use of fiber reinforced polymers; and other structural engineering services.</p>
<p>Secondary A-E services may be required for: preparation of DD Form 1391 or similar planning and programming related documents; technical reviews of Government prepared RFP packages for Design-Build projects and Government prepared design documents; and construction contract support services (CCSS) or post-construction award services (PCAS).</p>
<p>Support services may include: topographic surveying; geotechnical engineering; cost estimating; material testing; corrosion testing; and identification and abatement methods of existing asbestos containing materials, lead-based paint, and other hazardous materials.</p>
<p>The maximum contract value may not exceed $10,000,000 aggregate total. The minimum guarantee for the contract shall be $5,000. The minimum guarantee for the entire contract term (including option years) will be satisfied by the award of the initial task order. The maximum value of individual task orders executed under this contract is $3,500,000; however, the preponderance of task orders will be less than $500,000. There will be no dollar limit per year. Multiple task orders may be awarded with similar completion schedules and overlapping delivery dates. Contract term is for a one-year base period with four option periods. Each performance period will run 365 (366 for leap year) calendar days. The hourly rates will be negotiated for each performance period. The Government may exercise the option period unilaterally. Per NFAS 17.208-100(c)(1), options for post construction award services may be negotiated on individual task orders for unilateral exercise. The estimated start date is October 2014. The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541330 (Engineering Services) and the annual small business size standard is $14 Million.</p>
<p>The Government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or the actual amount of work to be ordered. The contractor is not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. Firms that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract or task order issued under the resulting contract are prohibited from providing the subsequent construction. This limitation also applies to subsidiaries/affiliates of the firm.</p>
<p>SELECTION CRITERIA AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS: Brooks Act (PL 92-582) and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 36.6 selection procedures apply. The evaluation and selection will be based on the following criteria: Criterion 1, Professional Qualifications; Criterion 2, Specialized Experience and Technical Competence; Criterion 3, Capacity; Criterion 4, Past Performance; Criterion 5, Location and Knowledge of the Locality; Criterion 6, Quality Control; and Criterion 7, Volume of Work. SF330s will be evaluated to determine the most highly qualified firm based on criterion responses. Criteria 1 and 2 are considered most important and equal among themselves; Criteria 3, 4, 5, and 6 are slightly less important and listed in descending order of importance; and Criteria 7 is of lesser importance and will be used as tiebreaker among technically equal firms. Evaluating past performance and experience may include information provided by the firm, customer inquiries, Government databases, and publicly available sources. Failure to provide requested data, accessible points of contact, or valid phone numbers could result in a firm being considered less qualified. In evaluating an Offeror's capability, the Government shall consider how well the Offeror complied with these instructions. All projects provided in the SF330 (Architect-Engineer Qualifications) must be completed by the office/branch/individual team member actually performing the work under this contract. Projects not performed by the office/branch/individual team member will be excluded from evaluation consideration.</p>

The organization chart, A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS) and Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluations shall not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation.</p>
<p>SF330, Part 1, Section B: Contract Information: In Block 5, list firm's Dun and Bradstreet Number in addition to the name of the firm.</p>
<p>SF330, Part 1, Section D: Organization Chart: In addition to the Instructions provided for the SF330, (i.e. the names and roles of all key personnel in this contract/solicitation and the firm they are associated with), identify the overall relationship and lines of authority of the proposed team, including key subcontractors. (Note: All individuals listed on the organization chart are not required to have a resume in Section E, such as administrative or lower level engineering positions, or individuals not providing primary structural engineering services.) This chart shall not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation. This chart must be affixed to the submittal to avoid separation in handling.</p>
<p>SF330, Part 1, Section E, Resumes of Key Personnel, CRITERION 1, PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS: Professional qualifications of the proposed team members assigned to this contract in preparation of the required primary and secondary structural engineering services shall be evaluated. The evaluation will place more emphasis on qualifications in primary structural engineering services.

<p>CRITERION 4, PAST PERFORMANCE: Past performance with relevant contracts/projects with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, compliance with performance schedules with emphasis on example projects presented in Section F. Firms will be evaluated based on past performance assessments and other available information regarding past performance. Points of contact provided in other criteria may be contacted. A proposal with no record of relevant past performance information shall be evaluated neither favorably nor unfavorably. Superior performance ratings on relevant projects may be considered more favorably in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>Submission Requirements:<br />Show past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules. Submit an A-E Contractor Appraisal Support System (ACASS) or a Past Performance Questionnaire (PPQ) evaluation for each project listed under Criterion 2.

However, this does not preclude the Government from utilizing previously submitted PPQ information in the past performance evaluation. Submitted ACASS and PPQ evaluations will not be counted as part of the 30 page limitation and shall be attached to the SF330, behind the SF330 Part II document.</p>
<p>For each project provided as experience in Section F, list applicable awards and commendations.</p>
<p>CRITERION 5, LOCATION AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE LOCALITY: Firm's location within and demonstrated knowledge of the general geographical areas in which projects could be located shall be evaluated.

This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-78 effective 26 December 2014 which incorporates FAC 2005-79 effective 15 December, 2014.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 334290. The small business size standard is 1,000 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.

<p><br />NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

3 

VA Information Custodial Language: 
a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/ subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1). 

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on-site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements. 

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract. 

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract. 

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except 
618-15-2-6055-0027 
4 


as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed. 

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12. 

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response. 

l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system 
618-15-2-6055-0027 
5 


interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR. 

Information System Hosting, Operation, Maintenance, or Use: 
a. For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerability scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation. 

b. Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII. 

c. Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks. 

d. The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to periodic, 
618-15-2-6055-0027 
6 


unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that may affect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary. 

e. The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost. 

f. VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractor- owned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VA- approved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE. 

g. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract. 

h. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are: 

(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive; 
618-15-2-6055-0027 
7 


(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or 

(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase. 

(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then; 

(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and 

(b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be pre- approved and described in the purchase order or contract. 

(c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation. 

Security Incident Investigation 
a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access. 

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant. 

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the 
618-15-2-6055-0027 
8 


business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement. 

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident. 

Liquidated Damages for Data Breach 
a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract. 

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination. 

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following: 

(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access); 

(2) Description of the event, including: 

(a) date of occurrence; 

(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code; 
618-15-2-6055-0027 
9 


(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected; 

(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected; 

(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text; 

(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control; 

(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons); 

(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any; 

(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals; 

(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and 

(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised. 

e. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $_______per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following: 

(1) Notification; 

(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports; 

(3) Data breach analysis; 

(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution; 

(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and 

(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs. 
618-15-2-6055-0027

b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required. 

c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

  (a) This is a competitive best value source selection in which the Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price, and other factors considered.

The Government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest	
19.1405 Service-disabled veteran-owned small business set-aside procedures.
(a) The contracting officer may set-aside acquisitions exceeding the micro-purchase threshold for competition restricted to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns when the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section can be satisfied. The contracting officer shall consider service-disabled veteran-owned small business set-asides before considering service-disabled veteran-owned small business sole source awards (see 19.1406).
(b) To set aside an acquisition for competition restricted to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, the contracting officer must have a reasonable expectation that-
(1) Offers will be received from two or more service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns; and
(2) Award will be made at a fair market price.
(c) If the contracting officer receives only one acceptable offer from a service-disabled veteran-owned small business concern in response to a set-aside, the contracting officer should make an award to that concern. If the contracting officer receives no acceptable offers from service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, the service-disabled veteran-owned set-aside shall be withdrawn and the requirement, if still valid, set aside for small business concerns, as appropriate (see Subpart 19.5).
(d) The procedures at 19.202-1 and, except for acquisitions not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, at 19.402 apply to this section. When the SBA intends to appeal a contracting officer's decision to reject a recommendation of the SBA procurement center representative (or, if a procurement center representative is not assigned, see 19.402(a)) to set aside an acquisition for competition restricted to service-disabled veteran-owned small business concerns, the SBA procurement center representative shall notify the contracting officer, in writing, of its intent within 5 working days of receiving the contracting officer's notice of rejection. Upon receipt of notice of SBA's intent to appeal, the contracting officer shall suspend action on the acquisition unless the head of the contracting activity makes a written determination that urgent and compelling circumstances, which significantly affect the interests of the Government, exist. Within 15 working days of SBA's notification to the contracting officer, SBA shall file its formal appeal with the head of the contracting activity, or that agency may consider the appeal withdrawn. The head of the contracting activity shall reply to SBA within 15 working days of receiving the appeal. The decision of the head of the contracting activity shall be final.

The provision at FAR 52.212-1, INSTRUCTION TO OFFERORS -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS (APR 2014), applies to this acquisition with the following addendum: FAR 52.216-1 Type of Contract (APR 1984): The government anticipates the awarding of a single firm-fixed price contract to fulfill this requirement; VAAR852.270-1 (JAN 2008)
The provision at FAR 52.212-2, EVALUATION -- COMMERCIAL ITEMS, applies to this acquisition. 
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 
EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD: The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be the Offer deemed to be the most advantageous to the Government.  Competing offeror's technical approach and past performance will be evaluated as significantly more important than price considerations, with past performance being more important than technical. The lowest price proposal may not necessarily be selected; likewise, the proposal receiving the highest technical rating may not necessarily be selected.  Offerors who propose to perform the work for an unrealistically low price will not be considered for award. Where applicable, the techniques and procedures described under FAR 13.106-2 will be the primary means of assessing proposal reasonableness. An offeror's proposal shall represent the offeror's best efforts to respond to the solicitation. By submission of its quote, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Offeror's must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and conditions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows: 
Factor 1: Technical Approach  
Provide a detailed narrative as to how the offeror plans to meet the requirements of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), addressing all points including, but not limited to, staffing, supervision, performance of the required tasks, and quality assurance.
Technical explanations will receive a rating of Acceptable or Unacceptable based on whether or not they address all aspects of the PWS in a satisfactory manner.
Factor 2: Past Performance
Past performance information will be evaluated in accordance with FAR 13.106-2.  In assessing past performance the Government may employ several approaches including: (a) reviewing past performance data submitted (b) seeking additional present and past performance and (c) using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources (e.g., the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS)). 
The Government will conduct  a performance confidence assessment based on aspects of an offeror's past performance, focusing on and targeting performance that is recent (within the last 3 years), relevant to the requirements of this solicitation, and similar in complexity and magnitude compared to the requirements of the solicitation.  Performance that is not recent, relevant, similar in complexity, or similar in magnitude will not be evaluated for purposes of the confidence assessment.  The performance confidence assessment process will result in an overall confidence rating.  This performance confidence assessment rating represents the Government's judgment of the probability of an offeror successfully accomplishing the proposed effort based on the offeror's demonstrated present and past performance.  Lack of recent and relevant past performance that is similar in complexity and magnitude to this solicitation will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably, but on a neutral or unknown basis.  If adverse past performance is revealed, the offeror will be afforded an opportunity to address the adverse information (unless the information was obtained through PPIRS, in which case the offeror has already had an opportunity to respond). 
3. Price: Offeror's price shall be evaluated to determine its fair and reasonableness.
Technical and past performances when combined are significantly more important than price. Offers will be evaluated to determine which offer provides the best value to the Government, all factors considered.
(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). 
(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. 
(End of provision)
Rating							Definition
Significant-Confidence	Based on offeror's performance record, the Government has significant confidence (i.e., little doubt exists) that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.
Satisfactory-Confidence	Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has confidence that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.  Normal Contractor emphasis should preclude any problems.
Neutral/Unknown -Confidence	No performance record is identifiable or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. 
Limited Confidence	Based on the offeror's performance record, doubt exists that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort.

STATEMENT OF WORK<br />POSITION DESCRIPTION<br />BACKGROUND<br />USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.<br />3 | P a g e<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Program Advisor (Multiple Positions)<br />SOL-OTI-15-000016<br />Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.<br />To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. Some of these USPSCs serve on intermittent contracts and are referred to in OTI as "bullpenners," providing support in a surge capacity. Those serving in the bullpen must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations (insert for bullpen positions only). USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits. However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 11 of this solicitation.<br />For more information about OTI and its country programs please see:<br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives<br />INTRODUCTION<br />The Program Advisor is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success, and is skilled at building positive professional relationships with diverse teams, including implementing partners in the field and key stakeholders both inside and outside of USAID. This position calls for an experienced professional with strong program, project management, and budgetary skills. The Program Advisor utilizes their experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations management in the field, to provide ad hoc support for new country assessments, start-ups, and country program implementation support, as well as training and mentoring of staff both in the field and in Washington. The majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation.<br />9.

Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm<br />Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.<br />(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."<br />(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).<br />(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:<br />(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;<br />(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and<br />(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.<br />(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible 13 | P a g e<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Program Advisor (Multiple Positions)<br />SOL-OTI-15-000016<br />following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.<br />(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.<br />(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.<br />(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.<br />(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).<br />14 | P a g e<br />Solicitation for a USPSC OTI Program Advisor (Multiple Positions)<br />SOL-OTI-15-000016<br />ATTACHMENT 2<br />FAR 52.222-50 COMBATING TRAFFICKING IN PERSONS (FEB 2009).<br />(a) Definitions.

All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours. <BR> <BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <BR> <BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances. <BR> <BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default. <BR> <BR>

<p><br />Statement of Work</p>
<p>1. Scope: 3d Marine Special Operations Support Battalion (3D MSOSB) trains and prepares Marine Special Operations Support Teams (MSOST) for deployments with Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) companies and teams. During FY 15, 3D MSOSB will conduct training for MSOST Kilo and Lima. MSOST Kilo and Lima will participate in 3D MSOSB's led Team Readiness Exercise (TRX), which is the culminating event prior to change of operational control to 3d Marine Special Operations Battalion. TRX is 3D MSOSB Commander's opportunity to evaluate the MSOST in their ability to provide fused, multi-disciplinary intelligence, communications, and logistics support to their future MSOC Commanders and MSOTs.</p>
<p>2. Purpose: The purpose of this Statement of Work (SOW) is to define the need for a reliable and flexible Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform for ISR Tactical Controller evaluation training and special collection during the FY 15 TRXs. ISR Tactical Controller training is critical to prepare the Marines of the Direct Support Team (DST) to deploy and support full spectrum intelligence operations and special operations missions. ISR is also essential in supporting multi-disciplined intelligence training. ISR mission planning and coordination is a crucial part of the team's ability to plan and direct intelligence operations of the DST.</p>
<p>3. Applicable Documents: Intelligence Chapter (draft) , MARSOF Training and Readiness Manual, and NAVAIR Flight Clearance Instruction 13034.1D.</p>

<p><em><strong>Interested parties are advised that notices and information about the RFSE program were previously placed on FBO under the number FA8214-14-R-9000. Due to numbering requirements, this number has changed to FA8214-15-R-0001. Interested parties may want to update their notices on FBO.</strong></em></p>
<p>The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Contracting Division, Hill Air Force Base, UT intends to issue a solicitation for Reentry Field Support Equipment (RFSE) Production effort. The RFSE is a nuclear-certified test set. It is comprised of radio frequency, electrical, and structural hardware (including through-hole soldered multi-layer boards) which is integrated with government-provided, existing, non-commercial software. Under the RFSE production effort, the contractor will:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A - produce and deliver up to seven RFSE suites, up to four sets of<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; support equipment, and initial spares in accordance with the applicable <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; standards and government-provided drawings;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B - provide interim contractor support for all RFSE units;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C - train users on how to operate, test, maintain, troubleshoot<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;problems,&nbsp;and do field-level repairs the RFSE.<br />Contractors must have the ability to perform design requalification and recertification if circumstances necessitate a change in the nuclear-certified design of the RFSE-such a change would require nuclear surety and nuclear safety experience. Due to the nuclear-certified design, contractors must have a well-defined and detailed manufacturing plan (including environmental controls), stringent configuration control, and a high degree of quality assurance.</p>
<p>Delivery of the first RFSE unit will be made no later than 20 months after contract award, and all RFSE units and support equipment must be delivered no later than 44 months after contract award.</p>
<p>The solicitation will result in issuance of a Definitive Contract with multiple options. Draft parts of the solicitation critical to an offeror's understanding of the requirement have been released on FBO under the number FA8214-14-R-9000. This included Section L, Section M, and the model contract (with Contract Line Item Numbering Structure). Interested parties who seek more information on this acquisition (including but not limited to quantity, unit of issue, and destination information) are advised to review that draft release. The draft will be updated upon solicitation release, and offerors are required to review the solicitation for any updates.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be a full and open competition (not a small business set aside), using the lowest price, technically acceptable source selection conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.3, Source Selection and the Department of Defense (DoD) Source Selection Procedures (effective 1 July 2011) as supplemented by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS), and the Air Force Source Selection Mandatory Procedures (MP5315.3). A formal Request for Proposal (RFP) will be issued on or about 15 December 2014 on Federal Business Opportunities (FBO).</p>
<p>The solicitation (except the technical data package-see below) will be released on FBO. Paper copies of the solicitation (except technical orders-see below) will not be mailed. Interested offerors are responsible for checking FBO to obtain the solicitation and any amendments or other information pertaining to the solicitation and are encouraged to register for notification through FBO.</p>
<p>While the solicitation will be placed on FBO, the technical data package (TDP) will not. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application, and the TDP contains <strong>export controlled data</strong>. As such, the only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose. Those that are certified and registered will have a DD Form 2345 certified by the Joint Certification Program. For those contractors that do not have a certified DD Form 2345, but would like to participate in this acquisition, the form, including instructions for completing the form, is available at</p>
<p>http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/infomgt/forms/forminfo/forminfopage2220.html.</p>
<p>Interested parties are advised that approval of a DD2345 may take time, so completion and submission of that form now rather than upon or after release of the solicitation is highly recommended.</p>
<p>To obtain a copy of the TDP, offerors must request the TDP from the contracting officer listed in the below point of contact section. The request must include a copy of the offeror's current, approved DD Form 2345. Once an offeror's DD Form 2345 is verified, access to the drawings, specifications, and other program documents through the software program, TopVue, will be provided to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345. After approval of the controlling office, technical orders will be provided to the data custodian by mail.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Foreign participation at the prime contractor level is not permitted</span>. All offerors must be actively registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) (https://www.sam.gov) to be eligible for award. In addition, offerors must ensure their Annual Representations and Certifications are updated and current.</p>

<DESC>************************ ANNOUNCEMENT AMENDMENT 02************************ <br> The GSS Draft RFP notice is being amended for the following purposes:  (1) to provide industry questions and Government responses in relation to the GSS Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) posting; (2) to provide details pertinent to the GSS Industry Day, to be held on 11 FEB 2015, regarding instructions on vendor presentations (if applicable); and (3) to provide anticipated Government questions that will be posed of each vendor in the one-on-one sessions. <br>  <br> 1) Nineteen industry questions were posed in response to the GSS Draft RFP.  In response, as an attachment to this notice, the Government has provided two documents:   <br> a. Industry questions with Government responses (Word format) <br> b. Sample Ballistic Table Format (Excel format) <br>  <br> 2) The following instructions are specific to the vendors who may choose to make a formal presentation of their potential GSS solution during the GSS Industry Day one-on-one sessions with the Government. <br> a. If applicable, vendor presentations can be contained on CDs or on vendor laptops.  Data contained on thumb/jump drives cannot be accessed by Government systems.  The presentations will run from either Government equipment (with a vendor-supplied CD) or from vendor-supplied laptops via a VGA cable.  If you would prefer to email your presentation prior to the event, the Government will run the presentation from a Government laptop.   <br> b.

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - New Jersey (ACC-NJ), on behalf of the Armament, Research, Development, and Engineering Center (ARDEC) is releasing this special notice to inform interested parties of the Government's interest in establishing a Section 845 Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) with an eligible entity or group of entities to develop and mature technologies in the areas of Energy, Environment, and Demilitarization.    <br>    <br>  Section 845(a) (2) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 1994, Public Law (P.L.) 103-160, as amended (Title 10 United States Code (U.S.C.) Section 2371 note), authorizes the Secretary of the Army (SA) to carry out prototype projects that are directly relevant to weapons or weapon systems. The Government must ensure that, when an agency enters into an Other Transaction Agreement for a prototype project under this authority, nontraditional defense contractor(s) participate to a significant extent in the prototype project; or at least one third of the total cost of the prototype project is paid out of funds provided by parties to the transaction other than the Federal Government.   <br>    <br>  The Government is seeking to collaborate with a consortium to perform a coordinated research and development program designed to attract new technologies and spur development of basic and advanced prototypes which are critical to DoD's near and long term energy, environmental, and demilitarization technology goals and objectives that are directly relevant to DoD weapons systems, allowing for the improvement of U.S. industry, university, and Government capabilities as required to sustain U.S. military supremacy in energy, environmental, and demilitarization technologies.  <br>    <br>  A consortium comprised of educational, nonprofit, and commercial organizations and with broad and open membership is required to provide the Government a partner able to collaborate across barriers that include military/civilian, public/private, local/regional/national, and political/jurisdictional concerns.  The consortium should be open to new membership and display a broad array of expertise and experience, connected to energy, environmental, and demilitarization related technologies and applications.   <br>    <br>  The Government is seeking a Consortium to perform an integrated and coordinated research and development effort designed to encompass the following as it relates to energy, environmental, and demilitarization technologies:  <br>    <br>  - Leverage insights obtained via collaborative planning between the Government and Consortium members so that the Government is better informed on emerging technologies from the private sector and industry achieves greater understanding of emerging DoD operational needs that can be addressed with selected technology solutions.  <br>    <br>  - Reduce the DoD's reliance on fossil fuels and improve energy efficiencies within the Industrial Base and on mobile platforms.  <br>    <br>  - Advance the development of energy technologies to reduce the DoD's operational energy requirements.  <br>    <br>  - Reduce the DoD's energy demand, expand supply and build an energy-secure force.  <br>    <br>  - Advance the development of pollution prevention and mitigation technologies to sustain the Industrial Base and protect personnel handling potentially hazardous chemicals.  <br>    <br>  - Pursue the demonstration of novel techniques to treat hazardous pollutants at DoD testing and training ranges.  <br>    <br>  - Identify and act upon opportunities to gain system-wide operational efficiencies in the demilitarization of items from the DoD stockpile, with the goal of lowering the cost-per-ton of demilitarization.  <br>    <br>  - Pursue the development and implementation of designs, processes, tools and equipment for the cost effective end-of-life demilitarization of novel/new US DoD munition items and components.  <br>    <br>  - Pursue the development and implementation of designs, processes, tools and equipment for the demilitarization of other out-of-stockpile munition items and weapons systems including testing/training range residuals, production rejects, sea-dumped munitions, Captured Enemy Ammunition (CEA) and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW).  <br>    <br>  - Deliberately mature specified emerging technologies to the point of demonstrating the technology in an operationally relevant environment.  <br>    <br>  - Conduct research, including development and maturation of energy, environmental, and demilitarization technologies in a manner that enables effective transition of the technology to programs of record via early consideration of life cycle support aspects (affordability, manufacturability, sustainment, training, testing, etc.).  <br>    <br>  - Ensure the nature of the agreement facilitates and eases the entry of small and non-traditional companies, academia, etc. into this sector of the defense market.  <br>    <br>  The Government is seeking an established consortium with a collective expertise in the following technology objective areas related to prototype energy, environmental, and demilitarization technologies:  <br>    <br>  Energy Technology Sub Objectives:  <br>    <br>  01 Improved or Alternate Fuel Technologies for Weapons Platforms:  Ideas and technologies should focus on improved or alternative fuel technologies for military vehicles and weapons systems that relate to improving range, endurance, and reliability of air, ground and naval weapons platforms and reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lead to lower risks to supply chain logistics.   <br>    <br>  02 Enhance Supply Chain Energy at Forward Operating Bases:  The development of technologies to reduce supply chain vulnerabilities that are critical areas of risk for military missions.  Innovative methods are sought to reduce the demand for supply chain energy to sustained tactical, combat and stabilizing operations.   Key factors include transportation and distribution of energy to support manned weapon systems and platforms at expeditionary outposts, such as forward operating bases, combat outposts, and patrol bases.     <br>    <br>  03 Novel Weapon and Weapons Systems Energy Sources:  The anticipated level of effort includes technologies that will result in reductions in the energy load of equipment carried by dismounted and mounted troops to reduce pack weight, extend patrol distance and lighten the logistics load and vulnerability of supply lines.  Improvements in areas related to electronic efficiency, batteries that are longer-lasting and lighter, novel charging methods, and electro-textiles are examples of technology innovations needed to support the agility and maneuverability.  Novel energy sources are needed for weapons and weapons systems to include the equipment to acquire tactical intelligence, communications, and navigation (GPS and micro- and nano -scale low-power navigation sensors in GPS denied or compromised areas).   <br>    <br>  04 Strategies to Reduce Energy Demands within DoD Industrial Base:  The Government is seeking strategies designed to reduce energy demands at processing plants that support weapons development, manufacturing, testing, training and disposal.  Additionally, innovative technologies are needed to reduce strategic vulnerabilities related to energy dependency throughout DoD processing plants to provide uninterrupted Warfighter support and weapons development.   <br>    <br>  Environmental Technology Sub Objectives:    <br>    <br>  01 Unexploded Ordnance and Remnants of War and Munitions Detection:  The research and objective area is to provide prototype technologies to detect, characterize, remove and destroy or otherwise manage sites containing unexploded ordnance explosive devices and discarded military munitions.  Novel technologies and strategies are needed to address munitions above and below the soil or sediment surface and that are detected as single items or in multiple quantities.   <br>    <br>  02 Sustainable Manufacturing, Maintenance, Testing and Training of Weapons and Weapon Systems:  Novel prototype practices are needed to provide advanced capabilities to sustain weapons testing, live fire training, maneuver exercises, flight operations, other hands on experiences for the Warfighter at DoD weapon ranges, and sustain manufacturing capabilities of DoD weapons and weapon systems.  Innovative methods and prototypes are needed to focus on pollution prevention and mitigation methods and strategies in order to minimize the environmental impact of the operations within the DoD industrial base and depots throughout the world.   <br>    <br>  03 Protective Prototype Technologies Associated with Life Cycle Operations of Weapons and Weapons Systems:  The anticipated level of effort includes prototype technologies that can reduce the number of injuries, illnesses and fatalities associated with life-cycle operations for weapons and weapons systems.      <br>    <br>  Demilitarization Technology Sub Objectives:   <br>    <br>  01 Improve Efficiency of Conventional Stockpile Munitions Demilitarization Systems:  Innovative and safe technologies are sought to improve the system-wide efficiency and effectiveness of US stockpile demilitarization systems.  Improvements in equipment, processes, logistics systems, and other aspects of demil systems are subject to improvements in order to reduce operational costs and/or increase processing throughputs, as compared to existing systems.  Research goals for the demil of conventional and chemical munitions are to identify, develop, and/or exploit innovative prototype technologies and processes that emphasize both operational and energy efficiency.  Capabilities that maximize reuse and recycling of energetics and other munitions components will be considered if shown economically viable through a Business Case Analysis (BCA).  <br>    <br>  02 Develop Demil Strategies for Other Munitions and Weapon Systems:  The objective of this research is to identify, assess, develop and validate designs, processes, tools and equipment for the demilitarization of US and foreign munitions, weapons system and related components that are not part of the US demil stockpile.  Munition items and weapons systems requiring disposal include testing/training range residuals, production rejects, sea-dumped munitions, Captured Enemy Ammunition (CEA), including Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) and Explosive Remnants of War (ERW).  In some cases, these munition items are located in uncontrolled environments and require specialized or unique technology solutions to safely locate, assess, handle and dispose of the items.   <br>    <br>  03 Novel Designs and Plans for Demil Activities for New Munitions and Weapon Systems:  The objective of this requirement is to pursue the development and implementation of designs, processes, tools and equipment for the cost effective end-of-life demilitarization of novel/new US DoD munition items and components, for which no demil method currently exists.    <br>    <br>  Information submitted should include your organization, personnel, facilities, membership network and past experience to meet specific needs stated above.  Specifically, responses should contain the consortium's experience and capability information, to include consortium name, vision, mission statement, goals, membership (indicating traditional and nontraditional defense contractors), success criteria, metrics, management framework, articles of collaboration/by-laws, Consortium Member Agreement, accounting practices, fee structure and other information which the respondent considers of assistance in developing successful government/academia/industrial partnerships.  In addition, the consortium shall provide a list of its members which are experienced in each of the prototype energy, environmental, and demilitarization technology areas listed in this notice, along with a description of their capabilities for the categories under which they have experience.   <br>    <br>  Interested parties shall submit all pages as a single (.doc or .pdf) file.  Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. Please be advised that all submissions become Government property and will not be returned.  No sensitive or classified information will be discussed.

<DESC>UPDATE: 7 MAR 14; The OCI Submission due date has been extended to 28 MAR 14 by 4:30pm MT. No other changes have been made at this time. <br>  <br>  <br> ORIGINAL NOTICE:  <br> PRESOLICITATION NOTICE  <br> TEST ENGINEERING AND ANALYSIS SERVICES (TEAS)  <br>    <br>    <br>  PS-I - Introduction.    <br>    <br>  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC), White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) intends to issue a competitive solicitation for Test Engineering and Analysis Services, performed at WSMR, New Mexico.  A five-year (inclusive of option periods) Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) single award contract is being considered for this effort.  The requirement is being set-aside for 8(a) Small Business concerns.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, Engineering Services, with a size standard of $35.5M.  The anticipated release date of the RFP is on or around 9 May 2014.  <br>    <br>  Due to the potential for Organizational and Consultant Conflicts of Interest (OCI), this acquisition will be conducted using the advisory multi-step process pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 15.202.  The link to the draft Performance Work Statement will be listed at the bottom of this notice so potential offerors can make an informed decision about whether to participate in the acquisition.  This synopsis constitutes the Pre-Solicitation Notice and Step 1 of the solicitation process.  In this step, potential offerors will submit OCI-Free certification or submit information on potential, actual, or perceived organizational conflicts of interest that may affect offeror's viability for award (no other capabilities will be evaluated during this step).  The MICC, WSMR Contracting Office requests that potential offerors submit information that will allow the Government to advise them about their potential as viable OCI-Free competitors.  The required submission information is outlined in  quote mark OCI Submission Instructions quote mark  below.  The offeror's submission shall be sent electronically to Mari B. Beckler at mari.b.beckler.civ@mail.mil and are due by 4:30pm MT on 14 March 2014.  Submissions not received by the deadline of 14 March 2014 at 4:30 pm MT will be handled as a Late Proposal subject to the rules in subparagraph c of FAR 52.215-1 Instructions to Offerors -- Competitive Acquisition.  <br>    <br>  After the Government reviews and evaluates OCI responses, each offeror shall be advised in writing if it will be invited to participate in the resultant acquisition or, based on the information submitted, that it is unlikely to be a viable OCI-Free competitor.  Respondents not considered viable competitors due to OCI issues will receive the general basis for these findings.  In accordance with FAR 15.202(b), those respondents will also be advised that, notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their OCI submissions, they may participate in the resultant acquisition.  The invite to participate in resultant acquisition does not absolve the offeror of additional OCI scrutiny and the Government reserves the right to eliminate offerors from competition if conflicts are discovered at any point during the acquisition.  The decision to participate in this acquisition is a business decision made by the offeror and the Government shall not be held liable for excluding any offeror from participation based on OCI determination.  <br>    <br>  PS-II - Clauses that will be included in the resultant solicitation and contract.  <br>    <br>  (1) 5152.209-4000 PERSONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (PCI).

In no event shall such personnel be utilized in a supervisory capacity in the performance of this contract.  In addition, the contractor shall not offer a position to any current or former Department of Army employee, military or civilian, who has not first obtained the approvals required by DOD Directive 5500.7-R, Joint Ethics Regulation (JER), and implementing Army Regulations 24.

(MAY 2013) (LOCAL CLAUSE)  <br>    <br>  (a) If the Contractor identifies an organizational conflict of interest that was not previously addressed and for which a waiver has not been granted, or a change to any relevant facts relating to a previously identified organizational conflict of interest, the Contractor shall make a prompt and full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.  Organizational conflicts of interest that arise during performance of the contract, as well as newly discovered conflicts that existed before contract award, shall be disclosed. This disclosure shall include a description of-  <br>    <br>  (1) The organizational conflict of interest; and  <br>    <br>  (2) Actions to address the conflict that-  <br>    <br>  (i) The Contractor has taken or proposes to take; or  <br>    <br>  (ii) The Contractor recommends that the Government take.  <br>    <br>  (b) If, in compliance, the Contractor identifies and promptly reports an organizational conflict of interest that cannot be addressed in a manner acceptable to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for the convenience of the Government.  <br>    <br>  (c) Subcontracts.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this special contract requirement, including this paragraph (c), in subcontracts where the work includes or may include tasks that may create a potential for an organizational conflict of interest.  <br>    <br>  Please note, while this first step is advisory, should an organizational conflict be identified before contract award, the offeror may be determined to be ineligible for the award.   <br>    <br>  PS-III - OCI Submission Instructions  <br>    <br>  The offeror's submittal shall be submitted electronically and should include information on any potential Organizational Conflicts of Interests (OCI).  The offeror shall describe their involvement in the development of any DoD System with details including contract numbers, dates, programs supported, a copy of Performance Work Statement to include list of deliverables, as well as contact information for Program Manager points of contact and contracting office points of contact.  Offerors shall discuss any competitions for developmental work in which the company is involved regardless of the stage of the acquisition.  The offeror shall present its rationale for why the cited development work does not create an OCI.  Supporting information for the assertion that there is no OCI is vital to facilitate the Government's evaluation of an OCI.  The offerors will be required to identify teaming arrangements, subcontractor and any perceived conflicts of interest pursuant to Title 10 United States Code, Section 2399, FAR 9.5 and ATEC Policy Bulletin 2-11.  The offeror must certify, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that it is not aware of any information bearing on the existence of any organizational conflict of interest (potential or perceived) that impacts its ability to perform Initial Operational Testing and Evaluation (IOT&E) of Major Defense Acquisition Programs (MDAP) systems.  The offeror must also include the same certification from each teaming partner and potential subcontractor.  Offerors' OCI certifications will be reviewed by contracting officer and legal support and an advisory notice will be given to each offeror.  A Non-OCI certification template is available via the link below; however, offeror's may submit the certification/information in any format compatible with Adobe Acrobat or Microsoft Office, as long as it includes all of the required information and is certified. In responses from offerors that indicate a potential OCI exists, offeror responses are limited to no more than ten pages. However, this page limitation does not apply to supplemental data such as, independent PWS, etc.  <br>    <br>  The draft Performance Work Statement and OCI Free Certification Template are available at:  <br>    <br>  http://www.wsmr.army.mil/Contracting/Pages/default.aspx  <br>    <br>    <br>

<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) notice. It is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. No solicitation is available at this time.
<p>The Department of Commerce, Office of the Inspector General (OIG), seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing E-mail Records Management Solution. This RFI is being posted by The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).<br /><br />Contracting Office Address:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B129, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640.</p>
<p>NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses. The Government is considering a NAICS code of 518210 with a size standard of $30.0M.</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed and specifications are developed for the service that can meet OIG's minimum requirements, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement. A small business set-aside decision may be made as a result of the information received. All small business organizations (SB, SDB, 8(a), WOSB, HUBZone, and VOSB and SDVOSB) are encouraged to respond to this notice.</p>
<p>Draft Requirement:</p>
<p>The OIG is developing a requirement for the following: (located at HCHB 1401 Constitution Ave., NW Washington, DC 20230)</p>
<p>OIG is seeking information in the form of capability statements from vendors who can assist us to meet the requirements of two joint issued memorandums from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) M-14-16, "Guidance on Managing Email" (http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2014/m-14-16.pdf) and the M-12-18, "Managing Government Records Directive." These two memorandums gave agencies specific deadlines to implement electronic recordkeeping of e-mail and other records formats for temporary and permanent records. The "Managing Government Records Directive" (M-12-<br />18) mandated that agencies implement records management of e-mails, which are federal<br />records by a deadline of December 31, 2016. To assist you in providing us the information we seek we are providing the following link: (http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/prmd.html).</p>
<p>Currently, OIG is using Outlook on an Exchange 2010 platform with BlackBerry Enterprise<br />Service version 5.0 as the mobile device solution. There are approximately 350 e-mail boxes,</p>
<p>predominantly used by the 160 federal employees, group e-mail lists, and 30 contractors. We have approximately 85 BlackBerry devices and a plan to implement Smart-phone capabilities. OIG recently awarded a contract for a FedRAMP approved cloud email and migration is<br />expected to be completed by September 30, 2015. OIG is seeking information on e-mail records<br />management solutions that would integrate with OIG's FedRAMP approved cloud email that are<br />either FedRAMP approved, if in the cloud, or that can be hosted at OIG, if not in the cloud. The<br />information on OIG's General Support System is designated Sensitive But Unclassified or<br />Controlled Unclassified Information.</p>
<p><br />Requested Information/ Questions for Capability Statements to Address:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1. Vendors are hereby requested to submit a capability statement that addresses their ability to assist OIG in meeting the goals of the directive through automation. (Papers should be no more than 12 pages and should not include marketing material, although hyperlinks to online marketing material are welcome.) Statements should address the questions in the following section two, but are not limited to answering those questions.

<DESC><p>Disclaimer:  This is not a solicitation.  This is not a request for quote (RFQ), invitation for bid (IFB), request for proposal (RFP), request for application (RFA) or an announcement of a solicitation, and does not assume the Government will award a contract or proceed with any of the above solicitation efforts in the near future.  This request is for information purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued or awarded.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect cost or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of information.  All information considered proprietary shall be marked accordingly.  The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for improperly identified proprietary information.  Properly identified proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with federal regulations.  The purpose of this announcement is solely to gather information from the marketplace, and any responses received will neither be considered an offer by the responding party nor returned to the responding party.  No telephone inquiries will be accepted, and requests for solicitation packages will not honored since no solicitation has been prepared.</p>
<p>Synopsis: Sources Sought</p>
<p>This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.  The National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is conducting market research for the purposes of identifying small businesses that have demonstrated capabilities in the area of  engineering and ground system engineering support.  No solicitation of offers is made by this synopsis.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The Government maintains a Command and Data Acquisition Station (CDAS) at Fairbanks, Alaska, for the primary purpose of acquiring meteorological and environmental satellite mission data from polar-orbiting satellites managed and/or operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC). This facility is NOAA's primary command and data acquisition facility for its polar-orbiting operational environmental satellites. The Station characteristics of having a high northern latitude and semi-remote location all combine to set Fairbanks aside as the premier data acquisition site for polar spacecraft missions. The Station coordinates are 64 degrees 58 minutes 37.711 seconds North latitude, 147 degrees 30 minutes 54.421 seconds west longitude. The station also collaborates with other U.S Government and international agencies to provide routine, contingency, and emergency support for polar-orbiting spacecraft.</p>
<p>The Fairbanks CDA Station is a National Critical Asset and therefore must remain in operations 24x7x365.</p>
<p>The Station's primary mission is to meet the command, data acquisition, data re-transmission and data distribution requirements of the constellations of polar-orbiting satellites managed and operated by NOAA. Ground station activities use ten antennas ranging from four meters to 20 meters in diameter, including two remotely operated antennas located in Barrow, Alaska. An additional three-meter antenna will be installed in Fairbanks in mid-2015.</p>
<p>Today's constellations consist of weather and other earth-observing satellites from the Polar Operational Environmental Satellite (POES), Suomi-NPP, METOP, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP), JASON-2, AQUA, AURA, LANDSAT-8, and COSMIC. The site also provides on-demand support for the westernmost Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES-W).  Future missions in 2015 will include JASON-3 and DSCOVR.  NOAA may add other missions to the Station during the course of this contract.</p>
<p>The Government will assure the necessary training, hardware and software resources are provided to complement the Contractor provided manpower necessary to achieve the operational availability required by each mission. The Contractor shall provide all the necessary resources to operate and maintain all station functions to assure timely delivery of data from satellite passes. The Contractor shall provide the operational expertise to fulfill a backup command and control responsibility for the NOAA polar program missions. The core staff assigned to the spacecraft telemetry, tracking, and control (TT&amp;C) and data management functions will employ Government-provided antenna monitor and control equipment that has automated many of the traditionally labor-intensive command and data acquisition functions.</p>
<p>The expected scope of this work is to provide general management, administrative, operations and maintenance services, and technical support requirements of the FCDAS, exclusive of identified Government-only functions, for all missions and projects of the station. Staff the FCDAS with appropriate technical, administrative and management personnel in order to maintain the ground station support services for the assigned, government-managed and -operated satellite constellations and the respective mission operations and data processing centers.  The NOAA Satellite Operations Facility (NSOF) in Suitland, Maryland, is the primary control and data processing center for NOAA spacecraft.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<p>Provide labor and materials for general management functions at the station.</p>
<p>Provide labor and materials for general administration at the station</p>
<p>Provide labor to operate, test, calibrate, and perform preventive and corrective maintenance on all systems and equipment used to support NOAA managed and operated missions and non-NOAA missions of the FCDAS. The Contractor shall be responsible for the total operation and maintenance of systems that support the primary and secondary missions of the station.</p>
<p>Provide all the necessary resources to satisfactorily perform all maintenance requirements for the FCDAS ground system elements, facilities, vehicles, roads, and other infrastructure. This includes routine preventive maintenance on a scheduled basis, as well as corrective maintenance to the component level. This maintenance is scheduled with the control center to alleviate the operational loading during the maintenance period. To maintain a high level of efficiency and uninterrupted mission operations, a regular schedule of preventive and corrective maintenance on the FCDAS ground system is scheduled in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.</p>
<p>Perform personal property management services for the Station in accordance with Federal Management Regulation and NOAA personal property management policies and procedures.</p>

<DESC>Naval Facilities Engineering Command (NAVFAC) is surveying the commercial vendor community for all interested parties, and is soliciting information and comments from industry for the development and implementation of a commercial enterprise-wide software solution. The software solution shall collect diverse building or utility data points, apply a software data point classification strategy, install an automated analytics, fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD) software package with a role-based operator interface for use by the Utilities and Facilities Monitoring &amp; Control System's (UFMCS's) operators to monitor and track Industrial Control System (ICS) performance on NAVFAC serviced facilities. The software must also incorporate inputs from existing utility monitoring and control sub-systems into the role-based interface. The software shall contain control functionality that performs intelligent actions to manage ICS to satisfy mission assurance and energy and cost saving goals. In addition, there is a requirement to supply components which may include, but is not limited to the ICS software used to extract data points and software used in the tagging, automated analytics, and operator interface. It is required that the software solution be integrated to a Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) platform enclave, designed to achieve information assurance compliance and accreditation. Should this become a requirement, the design documentation of the Platform Enclave will be provided as Government Furnished Information at that time. The proposed solutions must be flexible, scalable, and configurable.<br /><br />NAVFAC is the ICS service provider for the Department of the Navy. In accordance with OPNAVINST 4100. 5E (Shore Energy Management), NAVFAC Headquarters issued a Capability Development Document (CDD) in October 2013, to provide requirements to consolidate disparate utilities and energy ICS operations into one formal program called Smart Grid. The CDD can be found at http://www.navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/Public%20Works/PDFs/UES/Navy%20and%20Marine%20Corps%20Smart%20Grid%20CDD%20Industry%20Version%202014.pdf . In accordance with (IAW) the CDD, the Smart Grid program will collect, display, record, analyze, and disseminate information, and provide integrated Command and Control regarding the status of monitored building and utility subsystems in a uniform, secure and affordable manner in order to reduce cost, reduce energy consumption, and to support mission assurance.<br /><br />A key capability for this software solution is advanced data analytics that does the "thinking" for the operator so the operator can do less data analyzation and achieve timely decisions faster. This RFI describes the technical requirements for the management software to be used at an ICS Monitoring Station (IMS). The IMS is defined as a centralized work location intended to monitor and regulate building control systems, utilities and equipment. The Special Communications Requirements Division of Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, of St. Inigoes, Maryland, is involved in defining the IMS requirements and will be the recipient and facilitator of reponses to this RFI.
<p>The Navy UFMCS is built upon three (3) existing types of equipment;<br />i. Controlled electrical and mechanical equipment such as utility switch gear, pumps and Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning equipment,<br />ii. Equipment controllers that provide direct real-time control loops for the equipment; and,<br />iii. Local monitor and control sub-systems such as Building Control System and Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).</p>
<p>The Navy UFMCS itself is composed of two layers; a) a GFE Platform Enclave in each NAVFAC Facility Engineering Command that performs ICS enclave network management and, b) a Common Software Architecture layer that provides the operational functions, Common Operating Picture (COP), analytics and data integration. The UFMCS collects real-time operational data from all ICS systems, transforms them into uniform format, and provides them as a service to enterprise level business application (such as Comprehensive Utilities Information Tracking System).</p>
<p>The NAVFAC software solution described throughout this RFI is required to collect data from or relating to the quantity of buildings and utility systems specified by the Government for up to nine (9) regions. Each region could have up to thirty (30) Military locations; the locations could have up to sixty (60) buildings that would meet the criteria to be included in the ICS program. Each building could have up to five-hundred (500) data points per utility/building.</p>

<p>TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>SOFTWARE SOLUTION:</p>
<p>The software solution shall include the elements that are essential to meet full operating capabilities which may include software modules, components and drivers, licenses, third party middleware, and technical support services required to collect data from, or relating to, existing facilities including the ICS and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). The software solution shall include capabilities to analyze the data for operational and energy efficiency performance and shall provide tools to describe operational deficiencies and recommend corrective measures to enable condition based maintenance. The Navy UFMCS software shall be an enterprise-wide solution, implemented separately at each Navy region that shall support the diverse building or utility data points, tagging strategy, automated analytics, AFDD, and role-based operator interface needs of NAVFAC's internal personnel and its tenant commands. Where available, the technology platform shall interface with local ICS two-way communication capabilities for monitoring and controlling building energy usage and utility power flow and deploying demand response/load shedding, peak shaving, and load shifting. The software shall include capabilities for energy cost analytics, or interface with Navy business software applications used to track the cost of power. The software solution shall have the capability to interface with a Government specified digital signage system.</p>
<p>Singular Software Platform</p>
<p>The platform shall provide seamless interaction of numerous applications. The platform must have an intuitive, graphically oriented user interface that provides seamless access and interaction between multiple applications used to optimize building or utility performance, deploy energy generation and load shed resources, and monitor energy procurement, usage, billing and cost recovery. For example, if the energy use platform shows an irregular load profile, the user should be able to drill down into the building or utility's ICS to diagnose the issue and make adjustments directly if the ICS allows two&#8208;way control or through a communication with the building or utility operator. The software solution shall support the ability to track operator communications through resolution of the issue. Another example is that the user shall receive an alarm about a convergence of high coincident building or utility energy use and a spike in electricity prices and shall have the capability to deploy or schedule (via ICS two&#8208;way control and/or communication to the building or utility operator) load shedding and onsite energy generation. The software solution shall allow for base level utility censors, maintenance alarm capability and the ability to inherit existing alarms into the new system. The energy cost platform shall show the event and resulting energy cost/savings/revenue.</p>
<p>Data Integration</p>
<p>Integration of the data and controls from legacy and future systems is required. The platform and applications shall interface with legacy building or utility systems as well as new systems being brought online. The software solution shall provide a seamless experience to the user including interoperability for Navy Marine Corps Intranet business analysis systems; because the building or utility in the portfolio have different energy management/generation/billing needs and capabilities the software solution shall provide the capability to develop customized building or utility programs and schedules to optimize mission capability and sustainability.</p>
<p>The Navy UFMCS solution shall include the capability to analyze financial effects of the data for operational and energy efficiency performance and shall provide regional and installation level tools to help describe operational deficiencies and recommend corrective measures.</p>

<p>To accomplish airborne-related S&amp;T requirements, the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) has tasked the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and Scientific Development Squadron ONE (VXS-1) to provide the necessary aircraft and support personnel. In turn, NRL maintains a Military Support Division (MSD), Code 1400, that ensures military and contractor personnel are available to meet project requirements. MSD also provides coordination and serves as a liaison between the scientific communities at NRL, other government activities and VXS-1 at Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River, Maryland. VXS-1 employs numerous aircraft to accomplish ground and flight test evolutions.</p>
<p>A complete performance work statement (PWS), personnel requirements, and contract data requirements will be available as part of this solicitation. <br /><br />A DD254, Contract Security Classification Specification, shall be applicable to any prospective work covered under this solicitation. Prospective contractors must have: (1) the required SECRET facility clearance and (2) personnel available with favorably adjudicated investigations and final DoD granted personnel security clearances. <br />Note: NRL does not sponsor clearances for contractors.</p>
<p>The anticipated ordering period shall be five (5) years from the date of contract award.<br /><br />Based on a survey of the market, the government has determined that the services to be acquired do not meet the definition of a commercial item. Therefore, the government does not intend to use the procedures as outlined in FAR Part 12 for this acquisition.<br /><br />This solicitation is issued on a full and open competitive basis. The Government anticipates award of multiple Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity Contracts with Firm-Fixed Price and Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee term and completion type task orders.<br /><br />NRL uses electronic commerce (EC) to issue requests for proposals (RFPs) and amendments to RFPs. Paper copies of the RFP will not be provided. The actual closing date for proposals will be stated in the solicitation when issued. <br />This solicitation and any amendments to it will be available via the internet starting approximately fifteen (15) days after publication of this announcement at the URL provided below. <br /><br />All responsible sources may submit a bid, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.

Funds:       0  OMA                        1  Other Funds:  	0160- Medical Services		

Name of Proposed Contractor:	Government Scientific Source, Inc.
Street Address:	12351 Sunrise Valley Drive
City, State, Zip:	Reston, Virginia 20191
Phone:	1-800-248-8030


2.	Description of Supplies or Services: An automated staining module for IHC and ISH that will replace an outdated model that fits with the system, protocols and procedures being currently used by the Minneapolis VA HCS laboratory

The estimated value of the proposed action is $ 108,695.00

3.	Authority: 

ORDER AGAINST FSS:  Authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program, Title III of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 USC 251, et seq.); Title 40 USC 501, Services for Executive Agencies; and Section 803 of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2002 (PL 107-107) and implemented by FAR 8.405-6.  Mark the applicable exception:

0  An urgent and compelling need exists, and following the procedures would result in unacceptable delays(FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(A);

1  Only one source is capable of providing the supplies or services required at the level of quality required because the supplies or services are unique or highly specialized; (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(B)) or

0  In the interest of economy and efficiency, the new work is a logical follow-on to an original Federal Supply Schedule order and the original order was placed in accordance with the applicable Federal Supply Schedule ordering procedures. The original order was not previously issued under sole-source or limited-sources procedures. (FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C)

5.	Rational/explanation to support cited authority: 
The item is available on GSA contract through only one vendor: Government Scientific Source, Inc, a Veteran owned small business.  The item is being purchased to replace an older model and will match what it currently being used in the Minneapolis VA HCS laboratory.  The item will utilize a computer system and protocols that are already in place in the laboratory.  A system offered by any other brand will not connect to the current computer system and protocols would not be interchangeable. 


6.	BRAND NAME ONLY:  This buy is estimated to exceed $25,000 and this documentation will be posted along with the RFQ on e-Buy, as required by FAR 8.405-6(b)(3).

7.	Note that this determination satisfies the requirements of FAR 8.405-6.  The requirement to prepare a written justification IAW FAR 6.303 does not apply to Federal Supply Schedules.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information. <br>  <br> :  In response to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries 2010 Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS) Supplemental Biological Opinion (BiOp), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) have continued to enhance existing and develop new water temperature models for the main stem Columbia River and Lower Snake basin to  quote mark better assess the effect of operations and flow depletions on summer temperatures. quote mark  Water temperature models have been developed that employ the CE-QUAL-W2 (Version 3.6) and HEC-RAS (Version 4.2) models. CE-QUAL-W2 is a widely accepted water quality and hydrodynamic model for rivers, estuaries, lakes, reservoirs and river basin systems. CE-QUAL-W2 simulates basic eutrophication processes such as temperature, nutrient, algae, dissolved oxygen, organic matter and sediment relationships. HEC-RAS is also a widely accepted software application and is used primarily to simulate steady and unsteady river profiles but has the capability to simulate sediment transport and water temperature within a reservoir or river reach as well. The water quality module (WQNet) of HEC-RAS is based on the CE-QUAL-RIV1 model. HEC-RAS-WQNet has been deployed to model water temperature, and it is undergoing development to allow simulation of numerous other water quality parameters.  <br>  <br>

<p>SUBJECT: ONE (1) Portable Aerosol Lidar System - Mini Micropulse Lidar System</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: SB134115RQ0146B</p>
<p>RESPONSE DATE: Tuesday February 17, 2014, 4:00pm EST</p>
<p>CONTACT POINTS: Harry Brubaker, Contracting Officer, (301) 975-8330</p>
<p><br />DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Programs Office is issuing this solicitation for the purchase of ONE (1) Portable Aerosol Lidar System - Mini Micropulse Lidar System.</p>
<p>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A SEPARATE WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.</p>
<p>This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-79.<br />1352.215-72 INQUIRIES (APR 2010)</p>
<p>Offerors must submit all questions concerning this solicitation in writing to Harry Brubaker at Harry.Brubaker@nist.gov. Any responses to questions will be made in writing, without identification of the questioner, and will be included in an amendment to the solicitation. Even if provided in other form, only the question responses included in the amendment to the solicitation will govern performance of the contract. <br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334419- OTHER ELECTRONIC COMPONENT MANUFACTURING. This is a Sole Source solicitation.</p>
<p>GENERAL NARRATIVE</p>
<p>NIST has a requirement for a Portable Aerosol Lidar System for the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and Climate Science Measurements Program of the NIST Special Programs Office. Important aspects of the experimental capabilities to be put in place are atmospheric transport measurements near the surface. Characterization of the atmospheric boundary layer and its dynamics are an important component of such an effort as a means to constrain atmospheric transport modeling results.</p>
<p>Sigma Space manufactures the Mini-Micropulse Lidar (Mini-MPL) system. It's unique features include a polarization switching capability that allow detection of the phase, either liquid or vapor, in clouds. These patents are U.S. patents 8,054,464 and 8,115,925, "Polarization switching lidar device and method". <br />The photon counting method detection is also a unique characteristic of the mini MPL. The advantages of the single photon counting method are primarily manifest in the parameters laser - detector after pulse frequency and the dark counts parameter.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 4:00 p.m. (EST) on February 17, 2015. Inquiries will only be accepted via email to Harry.Brubaker@nist.gov. No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
656-15-2-037-0060	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
N/A	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$30,844.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Commercial cable TV services for the VHASTC campus.


3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:

Charter Communications provides digital TV signal via underground cable. The only such provider in the St. Cloud area.
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
VHASTC Campus is officially recognized as State Historic Site. Commensurate with that status, the MN Historical Society  must approve all construction and modifications to the campus buildings. MNSHPA has declined requests to attach satellite dishes to the sides or on the roof of any of the buildings on campus. Charter communications is the sole provider of digital TV programming supplied by underground cable in the St. Cloud Area. Underground cable is the sole vehicle  to provide TV signal to VAMC Patients, that allows the medical center remain in compliance with the State Historical Preservation Board.  



5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Research was conducted via the internet and telephone conversations with every known TV signal provider for the St. Cloud Area. Only one provider, Charter Communications, provides TV signal via underground cable. We will continue to search for competition in the market for underground cable TV signal providers.


6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
