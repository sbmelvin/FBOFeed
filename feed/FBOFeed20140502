During the course of the on-line auction, offerors' proposed prices will be publicly disclosed to other offerors and anyone else having access to the on-line auction. This public disclosure is anonymous, meaning that each offeror's identity will be concealed from other offerors (although it will be known to the Government), and only generic identifiers will be used publicly for each offeror's proposed pricing (e.g., "Offeror A"). By submitting a proposal in response to the solicitation, offerors agree to participate in the Reverse Auction and that their prices may be publicly disclosed, including to other offerors, during the Reverse Auction. An offeror's final auction price will be considered its final proposal revision. No price revisions will be accepted after the close of the Reverse Auction, unless the Contracting Officer decides that further discussions are needed and final proposal revisions are again requested in accordance with FAR 15.307.</p>

However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.</p>

Additionally, this will capture and redirect an existing high flow watercourse back to the main channel. The project is located south of NYS Rt. 282., in the Town of Nichols, New York. The site can be located at 42.0244&deg; N Latitude and 76.3841&deg; W Longitude - near the Dandi-Mart truck stop.</p>

<DESC>The USDA NRCS in New York is preparing to issue a solicitation for work authorized under the Emergency Watershed Protection Program due to recent heavy rain and with resultant flooding conditions to relieve imminent hazards to life and property. The work under this project will correct the effects of a catastrophic failure of the streambank and road shoulder from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee in the fall of 2011. Moreover, the grading and shaping of the stream channel and installation of the grade control structures will attempt to stabilize the streambank and prevent further erosion.
<p>The main focus of the project is the reconstruction and stabilization of an eroded streambank threatening the west side of Foster Road. Approximately 4500 cubic yards of fill will be brought in to rebuild the eroded streambank. Additionally, the channel will be cleaned, graded, and shaped to a new cross section with rock vanes, stream barbs, and sloped rock riprap to stabilize the channel and protect the new bank. The project begins ~1000 feet upstream of the NYS Rt. 17C bridge over Ellis Brook in the Town of Barton, NY. The site can be located at 42.0372&deg; N Latitude and 76.4570&deg; W Longitude.</p>
<p>A bid guarantee of 20% of the bid price will be required with any bid. Performance and Payment Bonds in the amount of 100% will be required within 3 calendar days of award of contract. The location of the work sites will be within the flooded areas and as described in the solicitations. All necessary permits and land rights have been acquired.</p>
<p>A firm-fixed price award is anticipated and is being set aside for Small Business residing or primarily doing business in the New York State counties of Albany, Broome, Bronx, Chenango, Chemung, Chenango, Clinton, Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Essex, Fulton, Franklin, Greene, Hamilton, Herkimer, Kings, Montgomery, Nassau, New York, Oneida, Orange, Otsego, Putnam, Queens, Rensselaer, Richmond, Rockland, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Suffolk, Sullivan, Tioga, Tompkins, Ulster, Warren, Washington, and Westchester. The local area set aside is defined in accordance with the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.</p>
<p>The solicitation package, construction drawings and specifications will be posted and available from this site on or about May 16, 2014. Estimated date for bid opening will be on or about June 17, 2014. A pre-bid site showing is being planned for Tuesday, June 3, 2014, the details of which will be specified in the solicitation package.</p>
<p>Price Range is between $100,000 - $250,000</p>

<DESC>The USDA NRCS in New York is preparing to issue a solicitation for work authorized under the Emergency Watershed Protection Program due to recent heavy rain and with resultant flooding conditions to relieve imminent hazards to life and property. The work under this project shall protect the roadbank on the north side of Frost Hollow Road and the outlet of the culvert passing under the road. This repair shall also reduce the sediment load into Pipe Creek, and ultimately the Susquehanna River.
<p>The project focuses on the installation of stacked rock walls and rock sills to stabilize the roadbank on the north side of Frost Hollow Road. Approximately 600 lineal feet of stacked rock walls, 9' high, will be constructed on the north side of Frost Hollow Road. Stacked rock sills, tied into the walls, will act as grade control and promote aggradation along the toe of the walls. Dewatering channels will be cut through the existing gravel berms to redirect the flow to existing secondary channels. These channels will remain to become the primary channels following construction. Additionally, large trees along the roadbank will be cutoff flush with the existing ground and removed from the site. The remaining root systems will be left in place as removal may compromise the roadbed. The project is located along Frost Hollow Road, in the Town of Tioga, New York. The site can be located at 42.1085&deg; N Latitude and 76.4050&deg; W Longitude - approximately 1.5 miles west of the intersection of Frost Hollow Road and Halsey Valley Road.</p>
<p>A bid guarantee of 20% of the bid price will be required with any bid. Performance and Payment Bonds in the amount of 100% will be required within 3 calendar days of award of contract. The location of the work sites will be within the flooded areas and as described in the solicitations. All necessary permits and land rights have been acquired.</p>

Databases (QPDs), Military Handbooks, and other standardized documents from the DoD Single Stock Point (DODSSP) at Document Automation and Production Service (DAPS) in Philadelphia, PA. NOTE: Pattern, Drawings, Deviation Lists, Purchase Descriptions, etc. are NOT stocked at DODSSP. Most documents are available in Adobe PDF format from ASSIST-Online at: http://dodssp.daps.dla.mil. Users may use ASSIST-Quick Search to search for and download available documents directly using standard browser software. Documents that are not available for downloading from ASSIST-Quick Search can be ordered from the DODSSP website using the ASSIST Shopping Wizard after obtaining a DODSSP Customer Account by following the registration procedures. Users who do not have access to the internet may contact the DODSSP ASSIST Help Desk at 215-697-6396 (DSN: 442-6396), or mail their request to DLA Document Services, Bldg. 4/D, 700 Robbins Avenue, Philadelphia PA 19111-5094. NECO-22. The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. All responsible sources may identify their interest and capability to respond to the
requirement or submit proposals, quotations or capability statements. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. NECO-26. Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within
15 days of this notice. Lockheed Martin is the design agent, system integrator and the NAVSEA approved source of supply and certified depot for the AN/UYQ-70(V) weapon system. NAVSUP WSS does not possess the necessary engineering drawing masters, developmental specifications, engineering change data, interface specifications, etc. required to source these parts to another vendor other than Lockheed Martin. NAVSUP WSS does not have required Navy technical support activity (TSA) or in-service engineering support approval to parts procured or repaired by sources other than Lockheed Martin. Data is not currently available for competition. Lockheed Martin provided detailed analysis and justification for value-added parts which was reviewed by the AN/UYQ-70(V) host ISEA community. This review was performed to see if parts could be properly
broken out without negatively impacting host weapon system certification, configuration management and operating systems. The review revealed that the Government does not possess the in-depth technical knowledge; or the required technical documentation; or it is not up-to-date; or it is incomplete in content
for full and open competition. Configuration control of commercial parts is insufficient when purchase from sources other than the Q-70 system integrator. The integrator has the necessary operational, design, configuration management, integration and engineering knowledge when purchasing, building and repairing Q-70 parts for hosted systems. -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

Under the authority of USC 2304(c) (1) pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) (2), the product or services needed by the agency are available from only one responsible source or only from a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the agency. A determination not to compete this proposed contract is based on market research and is solely within the discretion of the government. Even though a Firm-Fixed Price/Sole Source Contract is anticipated, interested firms or persons may identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer, Ginny Reedenauer, E-mail: ginny.reedenauer@usnwc.edu.
 A determination by the Contracting Officer not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this Notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

The College of Distance Education (CDE), Naval War College, has a requirement to conduct two (2) nonresident evening courses in Theater Security Decision Making as part of the Fleet Seminar Program in the Washington, DC area.

The courses are essentially the same as taught in residence at Newport, with the CDE resident faculty preparing the course syllabus, procuring teaching materials, and funding administrative expenses.  Because the site of the courses is removed from the Naval War College (NWC) it is necessary to contract individuals who reside in these areas to serve as an instructor and local administrator for the courses.
 The qualifications for this position are unique in that they require a combination of professional education, naval warfare operational experience, a familiarity with Naval War College missions and functions, and competence in teaching at the graduate level, using the NWC methodology.

The following Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities specific to each course apply:

Ph.D. in International Relations; National Security Affairs 
Joint Professional Military Education Phase 1 
Prior military experience at rank of 05 or above 
Graduate of a Senior Service College

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: 01 August 2014 - 12 June 2015

PROCEDURES FOR SOLICITATION/AWARD

A written Request for Quotation (RFQ) #N00124-14-T-0349 (Form SF 1449) will be issued in 1-5 business days after this Notice posting.
 Interested parties may obtain a copy of this SF 1449 from the FedBizOpps or NECO website or by contacting Ginny Reedenauer at ginny.reedenauer@usnwc.edu.

The RF electronics for the one Iridium antenna, which are located inside the fuselage underneath the adapter plate, could also be replaced in order to accommodate colocation of the Inmarsat antenna and associated antenna interface equipment. The SIC adjunct computers and displays will be repurposed for displaying coalition chat when not being used for Iridium operations.</span></p>

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT: THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUT INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY! It does not constitute a solicitation and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government.
<p>The solicitation number FA2521-14-Q-B113 shall be used to reference any written responses to this sources sought.</p>
<p>Patrick Air Force Base anticipates a requirement that is being considered under a small business set-aside program.

<p>Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners. The Government will use this information in determining its small business set-aside decision."</p>
<p>As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.

<p>All interested firms shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates company capabilities-indicating examples of commercial sales-and product specifications related to this effort.</p>

<DESC>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain comments on preliminary requirement specifications, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. A previous RFI was posted under the solicitation number W911S8-13-R-0007. Any responses submitted under the previous RFI have been received; however, the below questions are different than the previous RFI and MICC-Fort Carson is seeking specific answers for the questions listed below. <br>  <br> The Fort Carson Contracting Office is seeking comments on the below questions: <br> 1)	Briefly describe the Contractor's primary business line(s): <br> 2)	Provide the Contractor's DUNS number and Cage Code. Provide the socioeconomic status of the Contractor with this response, if any (8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran, economically-disadvantage-women, large business, etc). <br> 3)	Briefly describe the base operations and maintenance support services that the Contractor's company provides; to include providing resources to plan, organize, manage personnel, operate and perform the Fort Carson base operations and maintenance support services.  <br> 4)	Please demonstrate the Contractor's capability by providing recent and relevant past performance history.  Please provide no more than five of the most recent and relevant experience to include contract number, location, value, period of performance and scope of work and point of contact. <br> 5)	Based on the Contractor's performance of similar services, what type of contract will work best for this requirement (Firm-Fixed-Price, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, etc.)?   Please identify and provide rationale for which elements of the contract may be performed with a firm-fixed-price or are best suited for cost reimbursement?    <br> 6)	Based on the functional areas of work, what would be the recommended benefit of using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable versus best value trade-off (when evaluating Contractor proposals)? Provide supporting information or recommend areas on the Contractor's professional opinion. <br> 7)	Based on your performance of similar services, provide examples of some factors that would provide most advantageous trade off factors for best value trade-offs.  <br> 8)	Based on the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), can the Contractor perform all work for this requirement? If not, what percentage of work will be sub contracted? <br> 9)	What past experience has your company had in managing contracts of this magnitude? What past experience of your firm makes you capable of handling a contract of this scope and magnitude? Were you a prime or subcontractor on contracts of similar magnitude? If you were a subcontractor, what part of the work were you responsible for? <br> 10)	What is your experience in being a prime contractor? Also, what is the maximum number of subcontractors you had on one contract with a scope of work similar to this one? <br> 11)	FAR clause 52.219-14 states that at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. How have you complied with this regulation on past similar contracts? Do you anticipate being able to comply on this contract given the PWS? <br> 12)	Does your company have the cash flow or resources available to manage a large contract if the Government pays on a monthly basis? Based on the projected workload, how long will you be able to sustain payroll, should a delay in payment, outside of our office control, occur? <br> 13)	Does the Contractor have an accounting system determined acceptable by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for accumulating and reporting incurred costs under cost-reimbursement contracts in accordance with DFASRS clause 252.242-7006?   <br> 14)	As the prime contractor, do you or will you have a purchasing system that complies with the criteria in DFARS 252.244-7001(c)?  If so, provide a copy of the letter identifying that you have an approved purchasing system. <br> 15)	Through past experience, what would be the recommended CLIN structure based upon the requirements in the PWS? <br>  <br> A Draft PWS has been attached to assist with the above questions.  <br>  <br> The Acquisition Strategy for this requirement has yet to be approved, and thus a set aside, if any, has not been finalized yet. Once a set-aside, if any, is known a notice will be posted on FBO. <br>  <br> The submittal in response to this RFI shall be provided on standard letter size 8-1/2 by 11 inch paper.  The submittal shall be no more than 15 pages. The font for text shall be Times New Roman 12-point or larger. Submitted responses should be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat format. <br>  <br> Responses are due no later than 24 February 2014, 17:00 MST. Responses shall be submitted via e-mail only to Amy Franklin, at amy.w.franklin.civ@mail.mil. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED. NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION shall be submitted in response to this RFI. <br>  <br> Questions regarding this announcement shall be submitted in writing by e-mail to Amy Franklin. A responder may request clarification or submit technical questions regarding this RFI in writing for any requirement that is unclear by sending an e-mail to Amy Franklin. <br>  <br> THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY to identify sources that can provide capabilities to the Base Operations and Maintenance Support Services at Fort Carson, Colorado and receive comments regarding the requirements documentation. The information provided in the RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.

<p>The U. S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating technologies and/or materials with potential application in device-assisted, user-interpreted counterfeit deterrent features on future generations of U.

<a href="mailto:ashley.n.mcqueen@nasa.gov">Ashley N McQueen</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>NASA is seeking broad information to update its market research regarding previously flown camera systems, systems currently in development for other non-NASA missions, as well as future camera technologies that are relevant to spacecraft missions in A) Low Earth Orbit (LEO), B) Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO), and C) Interplanetary Orbits (IO). <p> In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), the information requested is for planning purposes only and is not intended to bind the Government. <p> 1.	Background: <p> NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has undertaken several studies to identify the required technologies to complete satellite servicing endeavors at a variety of orbital destinations (LEO, GEO, and IO).  Of particular interest in these studies is the availability of visible and infra-red camera systems suitable for long-term space missions.  Early results of the various studies have shown that a visible-light camera with a pre-defined interface, a large focal plane array, and a commercial lens mount can become a flexible camera system used across a spacecraft for several different applications.  These applications include robotic tele-operations, long-range vehicle inspection, rendezvous proximity operations (RPO), localized situational awareness, as well as close range vehicle inspections.  Similar applications for infrared camera systems exist, however the limited availability of large format focal plane arrays and commercial lenses makes this generalization less applicable.  NASA GSFC is therefore seeking information regarding current visible and infrared camera systems that may serve as a flexible camera platform with a minimal size, weight, and power envelope that could serve NASAs interests at all desired orbital destinations.  Additionally, NASA seeks information on miniaturized camera technologies that could serve a unique role in close-in, localized vehicle inspection in a future satellite-servicing mission. <p> This RFI is an intermediate step in identifying relevant and interested industry partners for developing various camera systems to meet on-orbit requirements and performing subsequent testing to ensure that the requirements are met.  The main intent of this RFI is to solicit responses from industry on the current state-of-the-art in regards to spaceflight cameras. <p> 2.	Camera Systems: <p> For purposes of this RFI, NASA is interested in the following types of camera systems.	 <p> 	Visible Camera: NASA GSFC seeks a flexible, visible wavelength camera system that may contain a low-noise, large format focal plane array with a greater than or equal to 1k x 1k pixel resolution.  A commercial lens mount, or equivalent function, will allow this camera to accept a large variety of lenses with varying focal lengths that will yield a camera system capable of reconfigurable imaging properties.  NASA GSFC desires a focal plane array available in both monochrome and Color Filter Array (CFA) variations. NASA understands that currently available visible camera products may require modifications to meet any specific hardware requirements that may eventually flow out of NASA GSFC (changes in physical layer interface, video protocol, focal plane array (FPA), etc.)  <p> 	Infra-Red (IR) Camera:	IR camera systems are useful for various scenarios when lighting conditions are non-ideal for visible wavelength cameras.  NASA GSFC is aware of several 640 x 480 pixel Uncooled Focal Plane Arrays (UFPA) with sensitivities in the 8-14 micron wavelength region that have flown in LEO.  NASA has an interest in pushing the development of these detectors into the greater than or equal to 1K x 1K pixel range. Respondents are encouraged to propose current IR camera systems regardless of detector resolution, however GSFC is particularly interested in roadmaps to improve the resolution of IR cameras. <p> 	Miniaturized Camera:  With the upcoming launch of NASAs Robotic Refueling Mission (RRM) Visual Inspection Poseable Invertebrate Robot (VIPIR) Vision System to the International Space Station (ISS), NASA GSFC will demonstrate the feasibility of flying a miniaturized 1.2mm diameter visible camera system.  This camera system, along with an integrated light emitting diode (LED) array and light diffuser, will serve as a tool for close-in inspections of space station infrastructure.  NASA GSFC wishes to further push the boundaries of this technology and develop additional generations of these miniaturized cameras.  The intent is to provide miniaturized cameras capable of providing high-quality video at very short focus (object) distances.  Specifically, NASA is interested in miniaturized digital cameras with increased pixel sizes and focal plane array resolutions that result in HD-quality imagery.   <p> 3.	Generic Technical Specifications: <p> If NASA acquires any of the cameras described above, it will assess them based upon numerous criteria including, but not limited to, cost, Technology Readiness Level (TRL), spaceflight heritage, developmental lead time, delivery schedule, and applicability to the specific orbit destination.  The cameras in which NASA is interested shall meet the following general specifications:  <p> Availability: <p> 	General: GSFC is interested in flying camera systems that are already in development or have a successful flight heritage (extremely important). This is necessary for applications where no significant development time is available. <p> 	Camera Emulator(s): Can be available 6 months After Receipt of Order (ARO). <p> 	Engineering Development Units (EDU): Can be available 12 months ARO. <p> 	Flight Unit(s): Can be available 24 months ARO. <p> Operational Lifespan: <p> 	NASA is investigating various mission concepts including a twelve-month LEO mission, a five-year GEO mission, and a multi-year interplanetary mission. NASA seeks existing designs that can meet these various lifespans with little to no modifications, that is, one design compatible with all of these mission scenarios. <p> Environmental: <p> 	Radiation: GSFC has yet to choose a specific radiation model, but many models exist in the literature to provide a starting point for both the LEO and GEO environments. NASA seeks designs that ensure the survivability of the optics, optical coatings, detectors, and accompanying electronics in the radiation environment for the orbital lifespan. <p> 	Survival Temperatures: Camera specifications must account for the thermal limitations of the environment in which the camera will fly.  Internal camera components are likely to set the survivability temperatures for the cameras themselves. For example, temperature limits for both survival and operation may be held by internal camera heaters or thermal blanketing depending on the final temperature limitations of the hardware. Power used for internal heaters in a cold environment must be included in worst-case maximum power numbers. <p> 	Launch Loads: Standard GSFC General Environmental Verification Specification (GEVS) for a generic expendable launch vehicle shall apply. <p> Interfaces: <p> 	Standard flight-qualified physical (RS-422, LVDS, 1553, etc.) and logical interfaces (UART, SpaceWire, HDLC, etc.) are preferred. <p> 4.	Disclaimer <p> It is not NASAs intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as Proprietary or Confidential will be kept confidential. <p> It is emphasized that this RFI is NOT a Request for Proposal, Quotation, or Invitation for Bid. This RFI is for information and planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3 titled Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes, and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information submitted in response to this RFI.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS). It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation, synopsis, or related documents. <p> The Government reserves the right to consider a small business or 8(a) set-aside based on responses hereto. <p> All questions shall be submitted in writing to the points of contact listed below. As part of its assessment of industry capabilities, the NASA-GSFC may contact respondents to this Request for Information (RFI) if clarifications or further information is needed.

The intent is to better understand how the capabilities of interested local hotel/lodging vendors would meet the needs for future lodging and transportation for TSA personnel. All respondents must be in a 15 mile radius from Dallas Fort Worth Airport (DFW). Any forthcoming acquisition will be prepared in accordance with The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) http://www.acquisition.gov/far/index.html.<br />You are invited to provide information that will assist TSA in better understanding the local lodging industry and specifically the capabilities that each vendor has to offer. The information provided by each vendor will be used to ensure that requirements developed for any future solicitation maximizes efficiencies, competition, and adopts "commercial best practices", and all information submitted will be kept confidential. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue a RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website located at: http://www.fbo.gov. It is the responsibility of all potential offerors to routinely monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. <br />TSA seeks to establish a lodging program to incorporate flexibility required to meet the needs of diverse training groups, while maintaining outstanding lodging services that are within Government per diem rates. Interested lodging vendors are required to discuss in their capability statement if they will be able to provide transportation in order to transport TSA personnel who arrive from other geographic areas between Dallas Fort Worth International Airport to the vendor's lodging facility and also from the vendor's lodging facility to training facility within the 15 mile radius. Training courses are typically 4 to 5 days a week, 52 weeks a year. Transportation will be needed every day for up to 24 passengers and their luggage. The following information must be included with each response (1) Identification of your company including a specific point-of-contact, telephone number, mailing address, e-mail address, (2) a brief summary of lodging services that you provide (3) type of lodging facility: short-term, extended stay lodging, or corporate housing. Please define and describe in detail, (4) NAICS code for your organization. The Federal Government uses the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code to determine a company's business size. NAICS codes can be found at http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics (5) On average, how many providers/rooms do you have in inventory, (6) How are the room rates priced for your company (e.g. discount off the list prices, based on per diem, flat percentage off from list price, negotiated contract room rate etc.) for corporate and Government clients?, are room rates published, and if so, where? (7) How are negotiated contract room rates communicated to service providers and travel industry providers (e.g. travel agents, automated booking systems, etc.)? (8) What types and/or ranges of discounts do you typically offer clients? Compare discounts to commercial, corporate and Government clients and explain any differences in selling terms and conditions. Provide a typical sample agreement. (9) What drives changes to negotiated contract room rates and how often do they change? (10) What fees, if any, are associated with the date changes and/or cancellations of the room? (11) What data, if any, is collected on lodging spent for the corporate and Government clients? Please list the data elements captured and reported and their intended purpose. (12) Are your properties compliant with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) guidelines and the Americans with Disabilities Act guidelines? If not, why? (13) Does the Government per diem impact your ability to participate in a lodging program, and If so, why? (14) Is your company capable of receiving electronic requests for proposals and utilizing electronic communications? (15) If your organization will be capable of providing the transportation between the Dallas Fort Worth Texas Airport (DFW) and your facility and also the daily transportation from your facility to our training facility within 15 mile radius of DFW, please explain if this is an organizational owned vehicle or a subcontracted arrangement, (16) Are you currently registered in System Award Management (SAM) at http://sam.gov. (17) What other information, if any, would be important for the Government to understand about your organization?

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: center" align="center"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="COLOR: black">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>This Sources Sought/Request for Information (RFI) describes a capability of interest to the Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM), and requests information to assess industry's capability to provide a materiel solution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Information gathered from vendors in response to this RFI may be used to what extent the capability exists within the wider market place and assist in the development of the acquisition strategy to meet the requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The information provided in this RFI is notional and may change. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Government is under no obligation to revise any aspect of this RFI should any information provided herein change. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The Government will provide any additional information and issue any additional requests for information at its sole discretion via the FedBizOpps website only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Background:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MARCORSYSCOM is seeking potential sources that can provide the supplies and services that are described herein by way of modeling and simulation support for various Marine Corps projects. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The support includes support for model based systems engineering, research, development, testing, and evaluation of Marine Corps current and future systems in the areas of studies, analyses, systems of systems engineering, modeling and simulation, cost modeling, lifecycle modeling, design prototyping, test and evaluation, network and architecture modeling, integration, training and research and development (R&amp;D).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Marine Corps is currently involved in complex systems development, such as military vehicles and weapon systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>MARCORSYSCOM is initiating a model based engineering approach to move from a document based to model based acquisition process.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This transition requires the development and application of tools that support robust systems engineering and that can facilitate the design, trade space analysis of design alternatives, and configuration/baseline management throughout the entire lifecycle of a system.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>MARCORSYSCOM has identified the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) as the preferred means to describe complex systems-of-systems by being able to formally define subsystem interaction and organization, requirements, parametric relationships, and more using a work breakdown structure compliant with Military Standard (MIL-STD) 881. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Our experience has found that SysML authoring tools are single-user, thick-client software applications geared towards only model definition, forcing sequential model development and losing an opportunity to parallelize effort. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Additionally, the completed model is not in and of itself able to execute tradespace exploration or constraint optimization. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Most complex system development occurs in geographically disparate teams working on various components of the model concurrently, which introduces a process complexity in configuration management and slows progress. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Although extensions to thick-client applications and separate software applications have attempted to solve these issues, the Marine Corps is applying a web-based SysML authoring tool which provides real-time collaboration. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>This tool, the Framework for Assessing Cost and Technology (FACT) is currently being used to conduct analysis of alternatives for ground vehicles and other weapon systems. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>FACT is a web-based, concurrent multi-domain trade space analysis capability that enables quantitative, real-time and collaborative model-based systems engineering throughout the acquisition lifecycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Desired Capability: </strong><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The desire is to continue to be able to develop and utilize FACT in an ongoing basis in order to support M&amp;S requirements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The goal is to apply SysML through the FACT tool such that users have up-to-date information and can concurrently modify the model in a variety of different areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The desire is to have the FACT tool be a real-time, collaborative modeling, simulation and design web-service. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Continual support by way of software development and implementation, system upgrades and changes, creation of new modeling capabilities, uploading of new designs and parameters for additional systems, being able to integrate inputs from other commercial models, and to provide training for users of the system are all desired capabilities. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Knowledge and familiarity with SysML and common commercial based modeling and simulation tools in order to be able to continue the development and use of FACT are important. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Training is not able to be provided on the current system by the Marine Corps and is incumbent on any source to be able to utilize, maintain, and build upon the existing platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any vendor that has the potential capability to provide this requirement is encouraged to submit a response.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Courier New'">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Requested Information:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vendors are requested to provide the following information on their ability to meet the desired capability:</p>
<p><span style="COLOR: windowtext">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Since SysML is a graphically based standard, prior to release of the XMI specification vendors are asked to propose their approach to define a data schema for storing a SysML model in a database and format to be used by FACT. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The vendor should explain their approach to import and export SysML <span style="COLOR: windowtext">models in the SysML XMI specification format.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the vendor should describe how models created or edited using the in-browser tool can then also be exported for use with other authoring tools.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The objective is to define a clear path to demonstrate a full-feature in-browser SysML authoring tool.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Responses:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 15.201 (e), the Government does not presently intend to award a contract, but wants to obtain price, delivery, other market information, or capabilities for planning purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This RFI is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or otherwise obligate the Government to issue any solicitation for proposals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Vendors/interested parties are solely responsible for all costs and expenses associated with their respective response to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">MARCORSYSCOM will not pay or provide reimbursement to</span> vendors/interested parties for any costs associated with their respective response to this RFI, including, but not limited to any cost associated with any submission or information provided to the Government.</p>

<DESC>The VA Pittsburgh Healthcare System intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Spartan Construction Services, 580 Achertown Road, Ste B, Beaver Falls, PA 15010, for emergency repairs for directional boring of 14" carrier pipes and installation of 4 access vaults at their ends in connection with chlorine injection-related plumbing problems at the VA Heinz Medical Center located at 1010 Delafield Rd., Pittsburgh, PA 15215. 

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR 6.302-2 (unusual and compelling urgency) as it is believed that only Spartan (an SDVOSB) can perform the necessary emergency repairs immediately because there is otherwise insufficient time for any attempted competition.  The Government recognizes that there are other capable suppliers, but the urgency necessitated that a single capable supplier be contracted with immediately.

This notice of intent is not for competitive quotes. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) number is 236220. This notice is NOT a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document is available. However, parties may express their interest or capabilities accompanied by supporting literature by email to Jeff Greis, Contracting Officer, no later than May 9 at 4:00 p.m. EST.  Responses should be sent to jeffrey.greis@va.gov.   No telephone responses will be accepted.  Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement or proceed with sole source negotiations.  The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the VAPHS Contracting Officer.

<DESC>INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT
<p>HQ AFMC/A4 and HAF/A4I will be offering an Industry Day on April 24-25, 2014 at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Fairborn Ohio. The purpose of this meeting is to communicate with industry the AF Logistics IT Systems Strategy.</p>
<p>Our AF team is focused on developing a Logistics IT Strategy that establishes standardized processes, employing shared IT services, and driving efficiencies across supply, maintenance, product support, and deployment/distribution. These critical logistics business areas provide a framework in which we execute two major IT work streams. Stabilize and modernize operations of our existing, core logistics systems and transform processes to be more effective and efficient in meeting the warfighting missions. We are employing the Service Development and Delivery Process (SDDP) to help us, as a functional community, clearly articulate the business problems that we are attempting to solve.</p>
<p>Our first transformational initiative developed under this new strategy is Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO), supporting depot operations. Our next priority for the transformation work streams targets developing the supply chain and product lifecycle management business process requirements needed to support this repair network.</p>
<p>Many of our industry and government experts have brought technologies, tools, and methods to our attention which may assist in the way ahead. This close partnership with industry is essential for success.</p>
<p>In addition to the capability initiatives and SDDP, we plan to discuss the AF Transformational Strategy, developments of "Digital Thread" and the AF Infrastructure Standardization.</p>
<p>This Industry Day is restricted to United States citizens. Due to room size constraints, each company division could be restricted to 3 representatives depending on total registration size. Those contractors interested in participating should e-mail your request to Marie Lethcoe @ marie.lethcoe@us.af.mil. Please include attendee full name, company division name, contact phone, email, and driver's license number (with state of issue) to register for the event and be listed on the visitor's request list for Area B.</p>
<p>The event will be held in the Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) Kenney Hall, Bldg 642. All attendees must present a government issued photo identification on the day of the event. Participants will need to enter at Gates 1B, 19B or 22B to gain access to Area B (see the attached map). Your name will be on the Visitor Center's guest list supplied. Parking at AFIT is limited, so carpooling is highly encouraged.</p>
<p>Thursday, April 24; Registration: 8:00 - 8:30am End: 5:00pm<br />Friday, April 25; Registration: 8:00 - 8:30am End: 12:30pm</p>
<p>Food and drink with the exception of bottled water are prohibited in Kenney Hall. Attendees will be on their own for lunch in the local area.</p>
<p>Point of contact for this program is: <br />Ms. Marie Lethcoe<br />HQ AFMC/A4NP,<br />4375 Chidlaw Rd. (Bldg. 262), Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh 45433<br />Send email to marie.lethcoe@us.af.mil</p>
<p>Alternate point of contact for this program is: <br />Mr. Gary Bain<br />HQ AFMC/A4NP,<br />4375 Chidlaw Rd. (Bldg. 262), Wright-Patterson AFB, Oh 45433<br />Send email to gary.bain.1@us.af.mil</p>
<p>This is not a Request for Proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this announcement. This is to be considered an initial step in establishing industry understanding of the AF Logistics IT Systems Strategy and to allow the government team to determine market understanding and capability to integrate and complete the program.</p>

<DESC>This Notice DOES NOT constitute a request for a quote, or proposal for the procurement of products or services.  This Notice concerns an action which may affect the ability of commercial industry to sell the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government. <br /> <br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled (now operating as the U.S. AbilityOne Commission) is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.
<p>By regulation (41 CFR 51-2.4(a)(4) the Committee is required to complete an impact analysis related to the potential addition of the following product(s) to the PL:</p>

Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>

<p>The items listed above will potentially be added to the PL for the Total (A-List) Government Requirement.  That is, should any Federal Government agency determine a need for the product, the procurement of the item will be mandatory by that agency through the AbilityOne&reg; Program.</p>
<p>These products will also be offered through the AbilityOne Distributor Program.  If your firm is currently selling these products to the Federal Government through commercial means, your firm will continue to sell these products through your AbilityOne Distributor status and there would be no impact against your firm.  If your firm is not an AbilityOne Distributor but would like to become a Distributor, please contact the AbilityOne Program for guidance.  At a minimum, your firm must have a GSA Schedule 75 contract with at least 10,000 items on the schedule contract to be eligible.  Firms can become AbilityOne Distributors for limited items such as toner cartridges or janitorial/sanitation items but must contact the AbilityOne Program for more details.</p>
<p>If your firm is selling either the item(s) listed above, or the items that have been determined to be ETS, it is important that your firm report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1.	Total Company Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period.  When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations.  If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.  Please define the 12-month period reported.</p>
<p>2.	Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government for the same most recent 12-month period.  If reporting on more than one item listed above, please report the revenue per each item, whether the NSNs or ETS items, and identify the item.</p>
<p>3.	Identify the contract number that your firm holds to sell the item(s) to the Federal Government, the government agency, and period of performance (contract end date) for the item(s) your firm is reporting on.  Identify the specific items per contract.</p>
<p>4.	If your firm is selling the product through purchases by Government Purchase Cards (GPC), please identify that and the amount made through GPC purchases.</p>
<p>5.	Identify whether or not the deliveries under the contract have been completed.</p>
<p>6.	The length of time your firm has been providing these products to the Federal Government.</p>
<p>7.	Identify any small business statuses your firm has qualified for, such as 8(a), woman-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, etc.</p>
<p>8.	Provide your firm's DUNS number.  The number is needed to confirm your company's small business statuses with the Small Business Administration (SBA).</p>
<p>9.	Include your firm's mailing address.  Do not use post office boxes, as all replies are sent via means that will not be delivered to a post office box.  The address should be for the person who has signed the letter containing the information submitted.</p>
<p>All information requested above must be included in the response.  Responses that do not include the information requested will be determined to be non-responsive and will not be included in the impact analysis.</p>
<p>All responses will be held as confidential and will not be released to any outside party.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 16, 2014 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee will conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 8501-8506, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, and through the administration of its AbilityOne&reg; Program, provides employment opportunities for people who are blind or have other significant disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Products or services which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the authority of the AbilityOne&reg; Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL).  The PL can viewed on the agency's website at www.abilityone.gov.  Once a product or service is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<p>Before adding a product to the PL, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as products determined to be essentially the same (ETS) (41CFR 51-5.3(a), would have on the sales of firms that are currently providing the products listed in this Notice to the Federal Government and the extent to which the potentially affected firms are dependent on the income.   Once added to the PL, the products determined to be ETS to the product(s) added to the PL will be blocked from being sold to Federal Government agencies.  The products that have been determined to be essentially the same are:</p>

<DESC>&nbsp;
<p>DOL is seeking potential sources that are capable of providing the following:</p>
<p>The contractor shall propose an evaluation design to help the Women's Bureau to answer the questions such as "<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri">How does a woman job seeker's previous work-related experience influence the type of training she receives after entering the American Job Center? How does the interaction between the job seeker and the job counselor influence the type of job training that a woman receives; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>and related questions." <span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Understanding that there is an emphasis on placing those seeking training into training programs that will lead to placement in a high-demand occupation, the Women's Bureau would like to understand the factors that lead to the lower likelihood of non-traditional training placements for women.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;The Women's Bureau enlists the help of the contractor in determining the complete list of research questions to be answered. The Women's Bureau is interested in exploring whether focus groups (such as with women seeking jobs/training at the AJCs) and individual interviews (such as with job counselors at AJCs) can help us answer these questions; the evaluation design will be completed by the contractor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The evaluation plan, which would be designed by the contractor, will include (but is not limited to) its proposed research questions, evaluation/investigative methods, recruiting plans, analysis plans and reporting plans. The evaluation plan will also include a timeline with task list, as well as proposed deliverable deadlines.</p>
<p>The contractor will carry out the evaluation, choosing the sample of representative job centers (considering urban/rural, state of economy and other factors) in order to develop an understanding of the histories of women entering the AJC and barriers women face in receiving job training in high demand and non-traditional occupations for women, and be able to make recommendations to the Women's Bureau on policy or program changes for which the Women's Bureau can advocate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The final report will include (but is not limited to):</p>
<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in; MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt 0.75in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span>&bull;<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Executive Summary (no more than 4 pages)</p>

<p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.75in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contractor will schedule a briefing with the Women's Bureau, highlighting the final report and fielding questions from the Women's Bureau and perhaps other U.S. Department of Labor executives and staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This statement of work requires an understanding of American Job Centers (AJC) and the full scope of non-traditional occupations for women.</p>
<p>Deliverables would include written progress reports, evaluation work plan and schedule, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">draft / sample interview/focus group questionnaires, Detailed Evaluation Implementation Plan, Outline of Report, Final Report, final briefing and ad hoc briefings. </span></p>
<p>All interested contractors shall submit a response demonstrating their capabilities to provide the requested service to the Primary Point of Contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>
<p>Contractors responding should indicate whether they are, or are not, a small business, a socially and economically disadvantaged business, or a woman owned business. The general definition of a small business is one that is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in the field of operation in which it is proposing on DOL contracts and with its affiliates. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>NAICS Code to be used for this possible acquisition is 541512 and the small business size standard is $14 million. The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent acquisition. Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/Foreign-controlled contractor and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this sources sought synopsis is voluntary. This sources sought notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not individually be notified of the results of any government assessments. The Government's evaluation of the capability statements received will factor into whether any forthcoming solicitation will be conducted as a full and open competition or as a set-aside for small businesses, or any particular small business designation (e.g. SDVOSB, HUBZone, 8(a), SDB, WOSB, VOSB, etc.).</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE: All interested contractors shall submit a capabilities package that explicitly demonstrates&nbsp;their ability and&nbsp;experience related to this effort. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Please limit your response to 10 pages.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>

<SUBJECT>Innovative Safeguards and Security Designs to Combat Threats Against Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)
<SOLNBR>14_410
<RESPDATE>060214
<CONTACT>Bobby Middleton , Email bmiddle@sandia.gov
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has technologies that have the potential to decrease lifecycle costs related to small modular reactors (SMRs) in the areas of safety, safeguards, operations and security during the construction and operation phases. Sandia is conducting ongoing research and development into further upgrades in the area of nuclear material safeguards and performance of security systems with respect to a full spectrum of threats for small modular reactors. These improvements will help ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, thereby minimizing time loss and costs incurred in retrofitting and security personnel.<br /><br />Sandia's capabilities include traditional security analyses, application of RIMES (Risk Informed Management of Enterprise Security), response force modeling, cyber security, and supply chain security. These capabilities integrate safeguards, operations, safety, and security at the design level. Historically, these issues are considered late in the design phase of the plant, but integration of these key criteria in the conceptual design phase can substantially minimize construction and operating costs. <br /><br />Sandia's primary focus is in seeking a company or companies interested in partnering opportunities leading to improvements in operations and safety of new small modular nuclear reactors. Partnerships may take the form of Cooperative Research &amp; Development Agreements (CRADA), or Work for Others (WFO) agreements. <br />Sandia National Laboratories is planning a workshop, pertaining to this opportunity, for July 2014.<br /><br />Interested companies are preferred but not required to have experience and expertise in one or more of the following areas: <br /><br />&bull;	Nuclear system design, including:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Physical security systems.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Safeguards methodologies.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Safety systems.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Operations.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Cyber security.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Emergency planning. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o	Nuclear power plant licensing.<br />&bull;	Nuclear power plant construction.<br />&bull;	Nuclear power plant operations.<br /><br />In addition, potential partners must have a significant interest in developing this technology since the CRADA or WFO is expected to include funds-in to Sandia from the partner. <br /><br />To express interest and to obtain information regarding the workshop, please contact Bobby Middleton via email at bmiddle@sandia.gov.  <br /><br />Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.<br />

Justification and Approval Under
Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) Simplified Acquisition Threshold ($3K to $150K)
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b) (1) "Single Source"

1.	Contracting Activity:

Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, for the Portland VA Medical Center (PVAMC)

2.	Nature of the Action Being Processed:

A base plus option year service contract required for the payment of testing performed at University of Texas San Antonio Fungal laboratory.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs:

This procurement under PR # 648-14-2-066-0142 is for identification, susceptibility testing and synergy studies on fungalisolates.  The University of Texas San Antonio Health Science Center (HSC) laboratory has the extremely specialized skills required to perform and produce consistently reliable data. The University of Texas HSC offers the best avenue to achieve complete panel of tests including susceptibility testing and measuring voriconazole levels. In order to provide detail diagnoses to patients, accurate and consistent antifungal susceptibility testing is required. The difficulty in performing this type of testing is in the early stages of standardization and the University of Texas San Antonio HSC lab is the leader in performing this testing. This laboratory's methodology is preferred by the Chief of Infectious Diseases at PVAMC and offers the best option for ensuring our veterans receive timely diagnoses and treatment. Link to:  University  of Texas San Antonio Fungal Laboratory

A strong case can be made for therapeutic drug level monitoring (TDM) for treatment of serious mycoses. Reasons include the wide inter-subject variability in antifungal exposure, correlation between low concentration and treatment failure, and correlation between high concentration and drug toxicity. Several studies suggest that outcome of invasive fungal infections correlates with antifungal exposure. Low antifungal levels have been associated with the higher failure rate in patients with confirmed invasive fungal infections that are resistant to treatment. Additionally, voriconazole level testing is difficult to perform to the accuracy necessary to ensure the best treatment options for patients. The University of Texas San Antonio HSC Lab testing provides fast, reliable and consistently good data that allows for more comprehensive range of alternatives for treatment.

(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

The specific reason for restricting competition is only one responsible source available. In accordance with (IAW) FAR 6.001(a), acquisitions conducted under FAR 13 for SAP are exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, but still require a justification using the format of FAR 6.303-2, IAW the VHA SOP for Other Than Full and Open Competition; dated 09/23/2013.
 
The results of market research revealed that susceptibility testing is available from other laboratories; however only the University of Texas San Antonio HSC lab provides the advance capabilities that will allow for the following key diagnostic and treatment protocols required by the Portland VAMC.

"	Fungal identification specimens in any medium supporting growth.
"	Anti-fungal susceptibility testing methods for yeast testing comply with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) M27-A3 Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of Yeasts.
"	Anti-fungal susceptibility testing methods for mold testing comply with CLSI M38-A2 Reference Method for Broth Dilution Antifungal Susceptibility Testing of Filamentous Fungi
"	Synergy testing complying with CLSI M27-A3 and M38-A2 with minor modifications to allow for combination testing.
"	Employ the use of classic checkerboard dilution methods with testing parameters as described in NCCLS documents M27-A2 and M38-A.
"	Susceptibility testing for over seventeen drugs that identify fungal species.

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the A c q u i s i t i o n 	 Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): The contractor, University of Texas can provide identification, susceptibility testing and synergy studies on fungalisolates.

IAW FAR 13.104 (b), I orally solicited three small businesses on GSA Schedule 621 II, category 621-209. I received a quote from one small business on this schedule; however, the methodology of this lab testing protocol does not meet the standards required by Portland VAMC as indicated in paragraph 4 above.

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW FAR 13.106-3:

The services to be procured through this award will be acquired via an Open Market Sole Source award and this service has been procured in the past using Open Market Sole Source under VA260- 13-P-0020. The catalog price has remained unchanged from the previous procurement. The price provided by the University of Texas San Antonio HSC Lab price is $1855.00 compared to scheduled vendor, Cedar Diagnostic Medical laboratory and Pathology price of $3,788.02. The suggested sole source vendor provides a savings of $1933.02 and includes all test required for this procurement.


In accordance with FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(i)(ii), the market research and comparison of previous procurement, the price provided by the University of Texas San Antonio HSC Lab is reasonable and is in the best interest of the government.
 
8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):

The procurement list from Ability One was checked for susceptibility testing with no results.

The National Acquisition Center (NAC) MedSurg Catalog was searched and revealed three possible contracts for this procurement.

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:

The University of Texas San Antonio HSC Lab is the only laboratory that meets all Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) protocols with the ability to provide consistent reliability of testing that follows of classic checkerboard dilution methods. This methodology is unique to the University of Texas San Antonio lab.

Cedar Diagnostics Medical Laboratory and Pathology has an approved schedule contract (V797D- 30073) on schedule 621 II but it is not a mandatory VA schedule. Additionally, this laboratory does not met all the CLSI protocols and methodology required for this procurement.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:
There are two vendors that have expressed an interest in this acquisition; the University of Texas San Antonio HSC Lab and Cedar Diagnostics Medical Laboratory and Pathology.

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any  Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services  Required:

The reliability of the University of Texas San Antonio HSC Lab and it compliance with all CLSI protocols is in the best interest of the government. Further, this laboratory provides all the required testing needed by the Portland VAMC; whereas, the other laboratories found through market research do not.

<SUBJECT>--Laser Particle Size Analyzer
<SOLNBR>G14PS00360
<CONTACT>Gerald Lewandowski

<a href="mailto:glewando@usgs.gov">glewando@usgs.gov</a>
<DESC>The US Geological Survey (USGS) intends to procure by brand name only one (1) laser particle size analyzer with a trade-in of one (1) LS230 system. A Beckman Coulter LS 13320 Multi Wavelength laser diffraction Particle Analyzer (P/N 731311) with an Aqueous Liquid Module, Control Latron 300 LS (P/N 7800377), Computer and Monitor for LS and MS series (P/N: B00262) is required for the USGS Unsaturated Zone Flow Processes Laboratory (UZFPL) located in Menlo Park, CA.    The following is a list of specifications UZFPL requires to be met:
1. The analyzer must have an automatic, time-based laser alignment routine. 2. The analyzer must have a 126-detector array for the measurement of scattered laser light. This is a prerequisite in order to match the current obsolete system that we must replace. 3. The system must be able to recognize the sample distribution type without having the operator input this information. The must be no requirement for user to input the distribution type (mono-modal/multi-modal/broad/narrow etc). 4. The system must measure the entire dynamic range in a single analysis, Single wavelength: 0.375 um to 2000 um, Multi wavelength: 0.04 um to 2000 um. This is a prerequisite in order to match our current system, which we are replacing owing to its obsolescence. 5. The system must provide both Fraunhofer and Mie theory calculation options for the determination of the particle size distribution. This is a prerequisite in order to match our laser diffraction particle size analysis system that we are replacing owing to its impending obsolescence. 6. The system must have the function that allows the user to create our own Mie theory optical models.  This will allow us the ability to analyze samples with pure mineral species. 7. The system must have an automatic data-logging of analysis parameters. This will match the capabilities of our obsolete system. 8. We require the compatible aqueous fluid module.  9. The system must have software-controlled auto-rinsing on the liquid module. 10. The system must have the ability to have a settable, automatic reminder to run control samples. 11. In order to meet the demand of the researchers who employ our services and for QA/QC of our analysis we require the ability to have an individual automatic audit trail for each analysis file. 12. In order to meet the demand of the researchers who employ our services and for QA/QC of our analysis we require the ability to have automatic audit trail for system installation and use. 13. The system must have an optional data-mirroring (automatic simultaneous electronic storage of data in 2 separate locations. 14. We require that the system have detectors with continually averaging signal measurement. 15. To replicate and match the capabilities of the system we intend to replace, the system must have a reference background reading with a visual comparison of current background to reference background during the analysis cycle. 16. The system must have the ability for a file name generation protocol to enable automatic inclusion of a number of data fields into the filename, including date, time and operator. This will match our current capability. 17. The system must have an optional automatic print option at the end of analysis. 18. The system must have an optional automatic data export option at the end of each analysis. 19. We require a password controlled access to key functions. 20. WE require a range of operator levels with different levels of security settings. 
The following Plots, Charts, and Statistics Requirements equal or exceed the capabilities of our current system that we intend to replace.  This insures compatibility of the data and the analysis results.  The UZFPL requires: 1. The ability to produce trend analysis plots. 2. The ability for user-definable report formats. 3. The ability to display multiple result graphic overlaying. 4. The ability for channel-by-channel averaging of multiple size distributions. 5. A comprehensive statistical package that includes multiple distribution data averaging. 6. The ability for size curve interpolation. 
All offerors must consider a trade-in allowance for an existing USGS owned Beckman Coulter LS100Q/LS230 system. 
Based on the above requirements, the government intends to make a non-competitive award to Beckman Coulter of Brea, CA in accordance with 13.106-1(b)(1)(i) and the procedures in FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items. Other interested concerns having the ability to meet the USGSs requirement may submit a capabilities statement that must include a technical description of the item(s) being offered in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance by the agency with the requirements in the solicitation. All quotes must be submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than the closing date of this announcement at 2:00 PM Eastern.  All submissions will be evaluated to determine if competitive opportunities exist.

All questions must be submitted to the Contracting Officer no later than May 7, 2014, 5 pm Eastern.
This notice and any resulting solicitation or contract conforms to the requirements in place through FAC 2005-72, effective 30 January 2014.

<p>2. Specific Instructions for Volumes One, Two, and Three:<br />i. Volume One -- Technical Proposal (Do not exceed ten pages). An altered Government SOW submitted as Volume One Technical Proposal is not appropriate and will be considered technically unacceptable. Address the Technical Proposal subfactors as follows:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability.<br />Provide evidence of being a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages). <br />A. Contracting Information. <br />(1) Provide the signature block of the individual authorized to make an offer which includes individual's name, title, e-mail address and phone number.<br />(2) Provide cage code, data universal numbering system (DUNS) number, and tax identification number as registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). <br />(3) Organizational Representatives.

List shall reflect both contracting and technical representatives for help desk issues and troubleshooting.<br />(4) Evidence of Certification. Certification shall be in accordance with Clause 52.212-4 addendum (v)(3). Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.</p>
<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability .<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

These rates will remain firm fixed price during this process. This provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise this provision by unilateral modification to the contract before 10 days of expiration.<br />(4) The Contractor recognizes that the services under this contract are vital to the Government and must be continued without interruption and that, before contract expiration, a successor, either the Government or another Contractor, may continue them. The Contractor agrees to -<br />(i) Provide transitioning of services during cutover period without termination liability charges; <br />(ii) Exercise its best efforts and cooperation to effect an orderly and efficient transition to a successor; and<br />(iii) Notify the Government of any services not cutover after contract expiration.<br />(x) "Work Orders" is added as follows: Requirements for service provided hereunder will be forwarded to the Contractor through issuance of a local order (DD Form 1367 or a similar form).

<p>2. Specific Instructions for Volumes One, Two, and Three:<br />i. Volume One -- Technical Proposal (Do not exceed ten pages). An altered Government SOW submitted as Volume One Technical Proposal is not appropriate and will be considered technically unacceptable. Address the Technical Proposal subfactors as follows: <br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability.<br />Provide evidence of being a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages). <br />A.

List shall reflect both contracting and technical representatives for help desk issues and troubleshooting.<br />(4) Evidence of Certification. Certification shall be in accordance with Clause 52.212-4 addendum (v)(3). Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.</p>
<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

<p>2. Specific Instructions for Volumes One, Two, and Three:<br />i. Volume One -- Technical Proposal (Do not exceed ten pages). An altered Government SOW submitted as Volume One Technical Proposal is not appropriate and will be considered technically unacceptable. Address the Technical Proposal subfactors as follows:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability.<br />Provide evidence of being a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability.

Certification shall be in accordance with Clause 52.212-4 addendum (v)(3). Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.</p>
<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c.

Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services<br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B) Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided.

<p>2. Specific Instructions for Volumes One, Two, and Three:<br />i. Volume One -- Technical Proposal (Do not exceed ten pages). An altered Government SOW submitted as Volume One Technical Proposal is not appropriate and will be considered technically unacceptable. Address the Technical Proposal subfactors as follows:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability<br />Provide evidence of being a telecommunications company that owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages). <br />A.

List shall reflect both contracting and technical representatives for help desk issues and troubleshooting.<br />(4) Evidence of Certification. Certification shall be in accordance with Clause 52.212-4 addendum (v)(3). Documentation must be submitted indicating that the Offeror is a local exchange carrier certified by the affiliated state's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to provide services for this requirement (SPCOA - Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority, or COA - Certificate of Operating Authority).<br />(5) If the remittance address is different from the mailing address, include all applicable remittance addresses.<br />(6) Written acknowledgement of all applicable solicitation amendments.</p>
<p>B. Pricing Information. <br />(1) Schedule B Submission<br />a. Submit completed copy of the Government-provided Schedule B containing the Offeror's proposed amounts. Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing. If the Schedule B is found to be altered in any way other than entering pricing, the action will be considered unacceptable and consequently, a reason to reject an Offeror's proposal. Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c. Include all applicable discounts in your pricing. <br />(2) The US Air Force is a Federal Government entity, and as such, is exempt from certain taxes. Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company which owns most of its own facilities such as switching equipment, transmission lines and infrastructure, having the capability to provide Primary Rate Interfaces (PRI), Direct Inward Dial (DID), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>Subfactor 2 - Local Communications Services. <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror presents a sound approach for providing local communication services detailed by a SITE-SPECIFIC diagram and descriptive legend that clearly illustrates the Offeror's ability to meet all SOW and Appendix 10 requirements. Reference generic example diagram in Appendix 10.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC).

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract.

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation number is NIHLM2014131 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). The solicitation /contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-72. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541611 with a size standard of $14000000. This acquisition is being conducted using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13. The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Digestive, Diabetes &amp; Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) has a requirement to procure Check Writing Services:
<p>The Phoenix Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research Branch (PECRB) conducts research<br />related to Type 2 diabetes and its complications. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) supports and conducts research to increase our understanding of these diseases and to develop improved means of prevention; diagnosis, and treatment. Many of the diseases of interest to NIDDK are more common among American Indians than in the general U.S. population. The NIDDK's research activities are dependent upon e participation of American Indian Volunteers (and a smaller number of non-Indian volunteers) in approved medical research studies Conducted at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center and the Hu Hu Kam Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>PECRB has permanent research facilities in two locations: (1) at the Phoenix Indian Medical Center (PIMC) in Phoenix, Arizona; and (2) at the Guadalupe Clinic in the township of Guadalupe to conduct research related to Type 2 diabetes and its complications among American and Yaqui Indians respectively. For example, greater than fifty percent (50%) of adult Pima Indians and more than twenty percent (20%) of adults in many other tribes have diabetes. Therefore, the NIDDK's Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch was established to study this high-risk population.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall have knowledge of preparing and administering payments to research volunteers and be knowledgeable about the issues associated with payment of said volunteers. The Contractor shall support the participation of American Indians and non-Indians who volunteer for approved medical research projects conducted by the NlDDK. The Contractor shall be responsible for paying these individuals, including writing and issuing checks, maintaining payment files, and satisfying the requirements of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to reporting earned income.</p>
<p>The services of a contractor are required to facilitate the participation of the volunteers. Experience has shown that prompt payment to volunteer study participants is essential for both the recruitment and retention of volunteers as study participants. Consequently, on-site payment to volunteers on the day of hospital discharge or at the completion of outpatient studies is a requirement of the contract. It is also essential that the contractor maintain a bank account with a financial institution represented in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area for the purpose of issuing payment checks. <br /><br />The offeror must include a completed copy of the following provisions: 1) FAR Clause 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors - Commercial items; 2) FAR Clause 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items. As stated in FAR Clause 52.212-2 (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors will be used equally to evaluate offers: Technical Evaluation, Price, and Past Performance.</p>
<p>Note: Past Performance Information: Vendors must submit a listing of the most recent contracts/awards (minimum of 3) which demonstrate similar work in nature to this Solicitation. Contracts/awards may include those entered with the Federal Government, state and local governments and commercial concerns. Include the following information for each contract or subcontract:</p>
<p>1. Name of Contracting Organization<br />2. Contract Number (for subcontracts provide the prime contract number and the subcontract number)<br />3. Contract Type<br />4. Total Contract Value<br />5. Description of Requirement<br />6. Contracting Officer's Name and Telephone Number<br />7. Program Manager's Name and Telephone Number</p>
<p>3) FAR Clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items; 4) FAR Clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; 5) FAR Clause 52-212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items - Deviation for Simplified Acquisitions. The Dun and Bradstreet Number (DUNS), the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and the certification of business size shall be included. The clauses are available in full text at http://www.arnet.gov/far.</p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: In order to receive an award, contractor must be registered and have valid certification in the System For Award Management (SAM) http://www.sam.gov</p>
<p>Interested vendors capable of providing the Government with the items specified in this synopsis should submit their quotation to the below address.

QUALITY ASSURANCE (QA) WEB ANALYTICS SOFTWARE SERVICE
REQUIREMENT 1: SCANNING	
Scanning, as related to QA Web analytics software, refers to when that software crawls a website by using software code to automatically check all public Web pages and links on that website.  
We require that the software service allow for the following:
?	More than one Web area can be included in a single scan ?	Users can exclude specified files from scans ?	Users can run on-demand scans, if necessary. ?	There is no limit on the number of scans that can run simultaneously ?	Either scans be customized so as not to flag certain practices as errors, or those errors can be hidden/removed from the final QA reports REQUIREMENT 2: REPORT CREATION Report creation, as related to QA Web analytics software, refers to the aggregate Web area reports that diagnose the overall quality of a set of Web pages.  These reports include such diagnostics as misspellings, broken links, and missing metadata. These reports will be made available online every month for EPA.
We require that the software service include at least five (5) of the following:
?	Reports can include multiple Web areas ?	Reports can be easily exported by end users in multiple formats. ?	Reports include useful graphical representations of data. ?	Reports offer aggregate scoring for trends and comparisons. ?	Reports include hyperlinks to the pages containing errors.  ?	Reports link to cache pages highlighting the errors. ?	Specific checkpoints/metrics can be removed from reports. REQUIREMENT 3: REPORT USABILITY
To ensure the tool is easy-to-use and understand from the end users perspective, we require that the software service include all of the following:
?	Documentation is easy to locate and understand. ?	Explanatory text is easy to understand and provides appropriate context. ?	Functionalities are logically organized in the interface. ?	Users can easily navigate the tool, finding both high-level summary content and detailed error reports. ?	Users can easily export detailed reports on demand. REQUIREMENT 4: PRIORITY METRICS
While different QA software solutions offer different metrics, in some cases, there are four metrics that we require, given their importance to the EPA Web community. The software service must provide the following metrics:
1.	Are Link Integrity (Broken Link) reports available and usable? 2.	Are Page Weight (Site Speed) reports available and usable? 3.	Are Missing Alt Text reports available and usable? 4.	Are Missing Titles reports available and usable? REQUIREMENT 5: SUPPORT We require that the software service have an active support team that includes multiple individuals and can respond to issues within 48 business hours.
DESIRABLE (NOT REQUIRED) While only the Priority Metrics are required, the EPA Web community is interested in additional QA metrics that can either improve the quality and accessibility of the EPA website or help in maintaining/monitoring other aspects of the website, including website availability and the presence of Web analytics tags.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   <br>  <br> JUSTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FOR OTHER, THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION <br> 1.	Contracting Activity: <br> The contracting activity responsible for this action is the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), in support of the Pharmaceutical Systems Project Management Office (PSPMO), of the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA). <br> 2.	Description of Action: <br> Approval is being sought for a new Firm-Fixed Price contract utilizing FY 2014 US Army Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funds. <br> 3.	Description of supplies/services: <br> Four (4) Brand Name only GAMBRO Trima Blood Collection System apheresis machines and seal systems including one additional year of on-site maintenance at a total value of $314,432.00. <br> 4.	Authority Cited: <br> The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The FAR citation is 6.302-1 (FAR 6.302-1(a)(iii)(A)) and the FAR citation title is  quote mark Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements quote mark . <br> 5.	Reason for Authority Cited: <br> The Food and Drug Administration has approved a supplement to the Army Blood Program biologics license application for Whole Blood and blood components to include the manufacture of single Fresh Frozen Plasma collected by automated plasmapheresis using the GAMBRO Trima Automated Blood Collection System under U.S. License Number 611. The Food and Drug Administration approves not only the process for the manufacture of single Fresh Frozen Plasma but also the equipment that is used in the process. This ensures the safety and efficacy of the product when it is used. Any deviation of the biologics license could result in revocation (21 CFR 601.5) or suspension (21 CFR 601.6) of the existing license. The proposed contractor for this requirement is Terumobct and is the only known source to distribute the GAMBRO Trima Automated Blood Collection System. <br> 6.	Efforts to Obtain Competition: <br>   <br> No efforts will be made to obtain competition for this action as competition offers no expected financial savings or other benefits to the government. Based on the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the required equipment there is only one source capable of providing the required equipment and services. <br> 7.	Actions to Increase Competition: <br> This is a one-time requirement and no future similar acquisitions are anticipated at this time. If a similar requirement should arise in the future, every effort will be made to compete it to the maximum extent practicable. <br> 8.	Market Research: <br> Market analysis was conducted based on the Food and Drug Administration approval and only one distributor for the requirement was located. <br> 9.	Interested Sources: <br> To date, no other sources have written to express an interest. The notice required by FAR 5.201 shall be published. <br> 10.	Other Facts: <br> a. Procurement History. Reasonable efforts to retrieve the following items from the computer records, contract files, competition advocate files or other sources are expected: <br> i.	Contract numbers and dates of the last several awards. <br> Not applicable. <br> ii.	Competitive status of these actions. <br> Not applicable. <br> iii.	Authority previously used for less than full and open competition. <br> Not applicable. <br> iv.	If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, a summary of the contents of paragraph 7 of the justification for that procurement and an explanation of the results. <br> Not applicable. <br>   <br> v.	If any prior award was accomplished by full and open competition, a detailed explanation of the changed circumstance. <br> Not applicable. <br> vi.	An explanation of any unusual patterns, which may be revealed by the history, e.g. several consecutive urgent buys. <br> Not applicable. <br> vii.	If a justification was prepared to support the procurement made before this one, briefly describe the circumstances justifying the buy and whether there have been any significant changes. <br> Not applicable. <br> b.	Acquisition data availability. <br> A statement of need and the minimum essential characteristics for the required equipment and services exists for this procurement. <br> c.	Unusual and compelling urgency. <br> Not applicable. <br> d.	Subcontracting Competition. <br> Not applicable. <br> 11.	Technical Certification: <br> I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br> 12.	Requirements Certification: <br> I certify that the supporting data under my cognizance which are included in the justification are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief. <br>   <br> 13. Fair and Reasonable Cost Determination: <br> I hereby determine that the anticipated cost to the Government for this contract action will be fair and reasonable. <br> The price established for the required services will be determined to be fair and reasonable based upon the price analysis technique of comparing the proposed prices received with previous prices paid for the same service. Certified cost or pricing data will not be required in accordance with the exception at FAR 14.403-1 (b)(3). <br>

STATEMENT OF WORK:

Background:  Office of Informatics and Analytics Health Informatics is the programmatic home for a number of programs and projects that promote and host collaborative efforts amongst groups working on health information technologies (HIT), including clinical stakeholders and IT developers from within and outside of VA, and which includes VA Transformational Initiative 16:  Transforming Health Care Delivery through Health Informatics (also referred to as the Health Informatics Initiative or hi2).  The Health Informatics Initiative was established in part for the purpose of building a sustainable collaborative approach, capacity, and tools to deliver informatics solutions to transform health care delivery to Veterans.  Doing so requires cultural, informational, and technological paradigm shifts to implement a sophisticated electronic health management platform supporting cognition, communication, and workflow of patients and clinicians while assuring compatibility with other non-VA systems and partners.  Conducting the work of the initiative requires a collaborative tool providing managed input collection, consensus development, and decision making.  Workgroups, such as the one constructing a plan for Knowledge Management, are carrying out cognitively difficult work with time constraints (i.e., number of available hours) and limited opportunities for direct interaction of team members.  Thus, it is essential to maximize the productivity of such opportunities and the time put in by the team.  OIA currently uses ThinkTank 4 for this purpose:  this solicitation is for the purpose of continuing the subscription for a hosted group decision support system, equal to or better than the existing service.

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

<p>Question: Has the KC-10 Mode 5 acquisition strategy changed from sole source to full and open competition since the release of the President's budget?</p>
<p>Answer: The president's budget does not determine how an effort will be procured. This RFI is for market research to determine avenues the government has to achieve this effort, should they ever decide to procure it.</p>

Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractor but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award may be based on a combination of price, technical capability, and past performances detailed in the solicitation.

This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only as defined in FAR 15.201(e) to obtain comments on preliminary requirement specifications, it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. A previous RFI was posted under the solicitation number W911S8-13-R-0007.   Any responses submitted under the previous RFI will not be considered as part of Fort Carson's market research.  If you are a new or previously interested party regarding the BOS Services at Fort Carson, please submit a response to this RFI.   <br>  <br> The Fort Carson Contracting Office is seeking comments on the below questions: <br> 1)	Briefly describe the Contractor's primary business line(s): <br> 2)	Provide the Contractor's DUNS number and Cage Code. Provide the socioeconomic status of the Contractor with this response, if any (8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran, economically-disadvantage-women, large business, etc). <br> 3)	Briefly describe the base operations and maintenance support services that the Contractor's company provides; to include providing resources to plan, organize, manage personnel, operate and perform the Fort Carson base operations and maintenance support services.  <br> 4)	Please demonstrate the Contractor's capability by providing recent and relevant past performance history.  Please provide no more than five of the most recent and relevant experience to include contract number, location, value, period of performance and scope of work and point of contact. <br> 5)	Based on the Contractor's performance of similar services, what type of contract will work best for this requirement (Firm-Fixed-Price, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, etc.)?   Please identify and provide rationale for which elements of the contract may be performed with a firm-fixed-price or are best suited for cost reimbursement?    <br> 6)	Based on the functional areas of work, what would be the recommended benefit of using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable versus best value trade-off (when evaluating Contractor proposals)? Provide supporting information or recommend areas on the Contractor's professional opinion. <br> 7)	Based on your performance of similar services, provide examples of some factors that would provide most advantageous trade off factors for best value trade-offs.  <br> 8)	Based on the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), can the Contractor perform all work for this requirement? If not, what percentage of work will be sub contracted? <br> 9)	What past experience has your company had in managing contracts of this magnitude? What past experience of your firm makes you capable of handling a contract of this scope and magnitude? Were you a prime or subcontractor on contracts of similar magnitude? If you were a subcontractor, what part of the work were you responsible for? <br> 10)	What is your experience in being a prime contractor? Also, what is the maximum number of subcontractors you had on one contract with a scope of work similar to this one? <br> 11)	FAR clause 52.219-14 states that at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. How have you complied with this regulation on past similar contracts? Do you anticipate being able to comply on this contract given the PWS? <br> 12)	Does your company have the cash flow or resources available to manage a large contract if the Government pays on a monthly basis? Based on the projected workload, how long will you be able to sustain payroll, should a delay in payment, outside of our office control, occur? <br> 13)	Does the Contractor have an accounting system determined acceptable by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for accumulating and reporting incurred costs under cost-reimbursement contracts in accordance with DFASRS clause 252.242-7006?   <br> 14)	As the prime contractor, do you or will you have a purchasing system that complies with the criteria in DFARS 252.244-7001(c)?  If so, provide a copy of the letter identifying that you have an approved purchasing system. <br> 15)	Through past experience, what would be the recommended CLIN structure based upon the requirements in the PWS? <br> 16)	Please provide feedback on the draft PWS to determine which areas may be unclear or where more specific information may be useful. Do you have any overall recommendations for improving the PWS? <br> 17)	Fort Carson is undergoing significant expansion of facilities and infrastructure as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) gaining installation which makes it difficult for the installation populations and contract requirements to be predictable.  Based upon past experience with BOS services, can the contractor assist the government in indentifying benefits of a cost reimbursement contract versus a firm-fixed-price contract? <br> 18)	Indentify any measurable ways for the contractor and Government to assure cost controls. <br> 19)	Provide a recommendation and explanation of what type of fee might incentivize the contractor to control costs and also be the best suited for this requirement given the fiscal uncertainties and likelihood of frequent incremental funding. (i.e. fixed fee, incentive fee). <br> 20)	Will your company submit a proposal for this requirement if illegibile? <br>  <br> A Draft PWS and Draft Technical Exhibits have been attached to assist with the above questions.  <br>  <br> The Acquisition Strategy for this requirement has yet to be approved, and thus a set aside, if any, has not been finalized yet.

Further, the Army is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement. A previous RFI was posted under the solicitation number W911S8-13-R-0007.   Any responses submitted under the previous RFI will not be considered as part of Fort Carson's market research.  If you are a new or previously interested party regarding the BOS Services at Fort Carson, please submit a response to this RFI.   <br>  <br> The Fort Carson Contracting Office is seeking comments on the below questions: <br> 1)	Briefly describe the Contractor's primary business line(s): <br> 2)	Provide the Contractor's DUNS number and Cage Code. Provide the socioeconomic status of the Contractor with this response, if any (8(a), HUBZone, Service-Disabled Veteran, economically-disadvantage-women, large business, etc). <br> 3)	Briefly describe the base operations and maintenance support services that the Contractor's company provides; to include providing resources to plan, organize, manage personnel, operate and perform the Fort Carson base operations and maintenance support services.  <br> 4)	Please demonstrate the Contractor's capability by providing recent and relevant past performance history.  Please provide no more than five of the most recent and relevant experience to include contract number, location, value, period of performance and scope of work and point of contact. <br> 5)	Based on the Contractor's performance of similar services, what type of contract will work best for this requirement (Firm-Fixed-Price, Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee, etc.)?   Please identify and provide rationale for which elements of the contract may be performed with a firm-fixed-price or are best suited for cost reimbursement?    <br> 6)	Based on the functional areas of work, what would be the recommended benefit of using Lowest Price Technically Acceptable versus best value trade-off (when evaluating Contractor proposals)? Provide supporting information or recommend areas on the Contractor's professional opinion. <br> 7)	Based on your performance of similar services, provide examples of some factors that would provide most advantageous trade off factors for best value trade-offs.  <br> 8)	Based on the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS), can the Contractor perform all work for this requirement? If not, what percentage of work will be sub contracted? <br> 9)	What past experience has your company had in managing contracts of this magnitude? What past experience of your firm makes you capable of handling a contract of this scope and magnitude? Were you a prime or subcontractor on contracts of similar magnitude? If you were a subcontractor, what part of the work were you responsible for? <br> 10)	What is your experience in being a prime contractor? Also, what is the maximum number of subcontractors you had on one contract with a scope of work similar to this one? <br> 11)	FAR clause 52.219-14 states that at least 50% of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. How have you complied with this regulation on past similar contracts? Do you anticipate being able to comply on this contract given the PWS? <br> 12)	Does your company have the cash flow or resources available to manage a large contract if the Government pays on a monthly basis? Based on the projected workload, how long will you be able to sustain payroll, should a delay in payment, outside of our office control, occur? <br> 13)	Does the Contractor have an accounting system determined acceptable by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for accumulating and reporting incurred costs under cost-reimbursement contracts in accordance with DFASRS clause 252.242-7006?   <br> 14)	As the prime contractor, do you or will you have a purchasing system that complies with the criteria in DFARS 252.244-7001(c)?  If so, provide a copy of the letter identifying that you have an approved purchasing system. <br> 15)	Through past experience, what would be the recommended CLIN structure based upon the requirements in the PWS? <br> 16)	Please provide feedback on the draft PWS to determine which areas may be unclear or where more specific information may be useful. Do you have any overall recommendations for improving the PWS? <br> 17)	Fort Carson is undergoing significant expansion of facilities and infrastructure as a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) gaining installation which makes it difficult for the installation populations and contract requirements to be predictable.  Based upon past experience with BOS services, can the contractor assist the government in indentifying benefits of a cost reimbursement contract versus a firm-fixed-price contract? <br> 18)	Indentify any measurable ways for the contractor and Government to assure cost controls. <br> 19)	Provide a recommendation and explanation of what type of fee might incentivize the contractor to control costs and also be the best suited for this requirement given the fiscal uncertainties and likelihood of frequent incremental funding. (i.e. fixed fee, incentive fee). <br> 20)	Will your company submit a proposal for this requirement if illegibile? <br>  <br> A Draft PWS and Draft Technical Exhibits have been attached to assist with the above questions.  <br>  <br> The Acquisition Strategy for this requirement has yet to be approved, and thus a set aside, if any, has not been finalized yet.

<p>The U. S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP), is interested in obtaining, testing, and evaluating technologies and/or materials with potential application in overt, visual authentication features on future generations of U. S. currency. Technologies offered should provide effective counterfeit deterrence against all types of threats including traditional printing as well as digital reproduction. Proposed counterfeit deterrent features may be incorporated into the banknote (inks, substrate) or applied to the note, and should not require the use of any external device for verification. An effective overt feature should be extremely difficult to simulate or duplicate, but should be easy to authenticate by the public under most lighting conditions.<br />Technologies and/or materials submitted for consideration will be reviewed for inherent and relative effectiveness as a security feature, and may be further assessed for compatibility with design and production factors, durability, environmental acceptability, and other processing requirements.<br /><br />The Bureau will only consider technologies, materials, and detection systems for which at least laboratory feasibility has already been demonstrated (i.e. concept proven, lab prototypes or samples available). For initial screening purposes, interested parties are requested to submit preliminary samples and a brief technical description to:<br /><br />Bureau of Engraving and Printing <br />Office of Acquisitions <br />Attn: Kathleen Barton<br />14th and C Streets, S.W., <br />Washington, D.C. 20228-0001</p>
<p>The Bureau may submit offered technologies to outside technical experts under government contracts for their evaluation subject to the approval of the submitting party. Previously submitted materials or technologies need not be resubmitted. If you have any questions please contact Kathleen Barton via e-mail at Kathleen.Barton@bep.gov</p>
<p>Companies are requested to submit the aforementioned Capability Statement to the point of contact identified below by no later than 2:00PM Eastern Time May 1, 2015.</p>

<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Logistics Branch, at 395 E St. SW, Washington, DC 20472 intends to issue a solicitation in order to award multiple contracts for Manufactured Housing Units (MHUs), specifically:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Express One Bedroom MHU Standard "FEMA" Southern<br />Express One Bedroom MHU Standard "FEMA" Northern<br />Express One Bedroom MHU UFAS "FEMA" Southern<br />Express One Bedroom MHU UFAS "FEMA" Northern<br />Express One Bedroom MHU Standard "FEMA" CONUS<br />Express One Bedroom MHU UFAS "FEMA" CONUS</p>

<p>Theses units shall be built to meet FEMA's performance specifications which are based on 24 CFR 3280 (MANUFACTURED HOME CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY STANDARDS).  The contract(s) will be Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ).  FEMA intends to order a minimum quantity of 20 units.  The production level for this requirement is set at two different levels to enhance the opportunity for other than the Full and Open prospective offerors.  Contractors shall have the ability to ramp up production to a total of 150 units per week (Full and Open), 60 units per week (other than Full and Open) within 4 weeks of notice. The period of performance is (1) Base Year with (4) 12 Month options. The NAICS Code applicable to this solicitation is 321991.  This requirement will be solicited as a full and open competition using FAR Part 15 procedures, however since the MHUs are "Commercial Items" some FAR part 12 clauses have been incorporated also.</p>
<p>Place of Performance:</p>
<p>All work shall be performed at the contractor's facility, but contractor must have the capability to deliver to any state in the U.S.</p>
<p>Performance Requirements:</p>
<p>After award of the initial IDIQ contract, FEMA will issue task orders to acquire the number of units needed per terms and conditions of the contract.  The contractor(s) will be required to manufacture, and deliver manufactured homes that conform to the attached specifications and HUD Code provided in the solicitation.</p>
On January 08, 2014 FEMA posted a synopsis that Final RFP for MHUs will be posted on February 03, 2014.  However FEMA decided for efficiency purpose to post this as a "Draft RFP."  FEMA contemplates that this RFP will remain posted for ninety (90) days.  First thirty (30) days will be as "Draft Solicitation," and the remaining sixty (60) days as the "Final Solicitation."
<p>By doing so FEMA will accomplish the following:</p>
<p>1.  Will allow the industry ample time to proceed in obtaining necessary permits and licenses, etc from any other government entities.  These licenses and permits shall be submitted with the proposals.</p>
<p>2.   To solicit the industry feedback, input and comments on how to better enhance this solicitation, requirement, and if needed evaluation criteria in order to provide very clear and realistic final RFP which will encourage more participation.</p>
<p>This Draft Solicitation and its attachments are as complete as it possibly can be, but may be improved further with input from the industry.</p>
<strong>Proposals are not requested at this time.</strong> Proposals shall be submitted in response to actual solicitation (Request for Proposal (RFP)) in strict compliance with the instructions to be provided in the solicitation. However, prior to the release of the RFP, interested parties may contact FEMA regarding their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.

For each aircraft, the entire package will allow required access around the aircraft.  The maintenance stands and platforms shall provide electrical and pneumatic utilities. Maintenance stands and platforms shall permit the use of nose, wing and tail jacks, and these stands shall be adjustable in the vertical direction. The maintenance stands and platforms shall accommodate all configurations of each aircraft. The maximum amount of stands shall remain in place during maintenance operations. All areas on the stand that are positioned next to the aircraft shall be padded. Padded areas (bumpers) shall be a minimum of two (2 quote mark ) inches thick and cover the entire width of the deck sections and shall not allow any stand structure to come in contact with the surface of the aircraft. In addition, bumpers shall be constructed of a durable, compressible material, and shall be easily replaceable.  Walkways will extend beyond the leading and trailing edges of the wings.  Walkways will provide enough room for maintenance personnel to safely work on a two-step stand under the wing or aileron and flap areas. Walkways will allow maintenance personnel to remove the leading edges, ailerons and flaps safely within confines of the rigid handrails. Walkways will be wide enough to ensure maintenance personnel are well inside of the protective rigid hand rails when the wing flaps are in the full up or down position and a maintenance technician is standing on a two-step stand to prevent the use of additional stands to be placed next to the ISO Dock Stands for fall protection . <br>  <br> The stands will also have an option for an adjustable, up to 16 feet, deployable aircraft maintenance stand (Replace the B1-B4 stands).  This stand will have quick assembly, by no more than two workers within an hour.  It shall be lightweight, highly mobile, rotates 360 degrees on its own axis, is easily maneuvered alongside the aircraft and has a small storage/deployment footprint.  This platform will also have weight bearing sliders to conform to the profile of the area they are used on the aircraft. In addition, all independent platforms and stands will come equipped with fall protection devices that conform to OSHA and AFOSH standards. <br>  <br> The chassis/frame of the maintenance stands and platforms shall be constructed of corrosion resistant materials or treated to provide corrosion protection. The size and weight of the frame shall be as small and as light as practical, consistent with meeting the performance requirements of this specification. The frame shall support, at a minimum, 1000 lbs working load.  Each section shall be capable of being maneuvered by four (4) female (95th percentile) persons. The force required to move each section shall not exceed the requirements of MIL-STD-1472, and associated tables, Paragraph 5.9.11.4.1 (high traction). <br>   <br> Adjustable deck sections shall be a permanent part of the maintenance stand and shall have a positive locking mechanism to allow for proper aircraft interface. Adjustable decking shall cover all openings that are specified and shall allow proper stand to aircraft interface. Time required to adjust any deck section from fully retracted to fully extended shall be no more than 10 seconds. A bearing support extension system shall not be utilized.  Each adjustable deck section shall be capable of being operated by no more than two persons without posing a tripping hazard. The force required to extend the adjustable deck section shall not exceed the requirements of MIL-STD-1472. <br>  <br> The maintenance stands and platforms shall conform to all applicable sections and paragraphs of OSHA 29 CFR 1910 and AFOSH 91-203 standards.  The contractor shall be solely responsible for ensuring that the maintenance stands and platforms meets all applicable OSHA and AFOSH Standards as they apply to aircraft maintenance stands. The maintenance stands and platforms shall successfully pass an OSHA and AFOSH Inspection Walk down during the First Production Unit Testing. <br>  <br> All electrical equipment shall be NEMA 1 rated, approved and used under the guidelines of the National Electric Code NFPA 70. Electrical components shall be solid state and commercial off the shelf where possible for electrical plugs, connectors, and receptacles. A single 20 ampere 208/120v, 3-Phase connection shall be brought to each ISO platform side (right and left). This connection shall be terminated into a control box made of a manufactured enclosure with a lockable door; contactors, ground fault indication and protection, plug connections for lighting or other 120V loads as well as surface mounted labeled indicator lights for the various control box functions as deemed necessary. Lighting and receptacles shall be wired for 120V 1-Phase connections. Wiring on the platform shall use a combination of EMT conduit, junction boxes and well as SO type flexible cables where required to provide a flexible quick connect electrical system. Twist lock type connections shall be provided between platform components for ease of assembly and breakdown of the platform. Electrical outlets shall accompany light fixtures. Wherever possible, electrical and air receptacles shall be located beside each other. Electrical connections shall be available from the trailing edge stands, the fuselage/engine stands and underneath where the main landing gear is located. The electrical system shall comply with NFPA 70, National Electric Code. Separated stands shall not affect the basic electrical configuration. Main Electrical Feed Junction Box will be collocated with lighting control panel on wing tip stands. <br>  <br> Lighting shall be provided on the Stands for maintenance and inspection operations. Lighting shall be located on the perimeter of the stand and offer the greatest color rendition and illumination possible utilizing the minimal number of fixtures for the application. The lighting shall illuminate the entire engine area (both sides of each engine), the entire underside of the wing trailing edge area, and the main landing gear area.  There shall be a control panel for the lights on either side of the airframe and it shall be located on the wing tip stands. The control panel shall be equipped with three (3) 120V circuits to receive power. The first receptacle extends to the front side of the stand, the second extending to the back side of the stand and the third is provided for additional locations as deemed necessary. Separated stands shall not effect basic lighting configuration. Lighting shall not pose a tripping hazard to maintenance personnel. <br>  <br> Quick disconnect sockets shall be provided to accommodate all male quick disconnects and capable of supplying regulated air pressure up to 150 psi @ 250 CFM. Wherever possible, electrical and air receptacles shall be located beside each other. Air connection shall be available from every stand and underneath where the main landing gear is located. Air shall be available from two entry points one on each side. Separated stands shall not affect the basic air configuration. <br>  <br> Handrails shall comply with all OSHA/AFOSH regulations. The perimeter of stand shall have no chains. All perimeter railing shall be operable by one person and shall be at least 42 inches tall. When the engine propeller platforms are removed, adjacent stand shall be able to accommodate stair interface and OSHA/AFOSH Compliant railings. The railings will not have any  quote mark play quote mark  in them. All perimeter railings shall be able to be removed at the designated three positions of stairs when stairs are in use or in place when stairs are not in use. All rails that can be removed shall have a positive locking mechanism that does not require a tool to be used to disengage the rail from the stand. <br>  <br> All decking surfaces shall be solid, anti-skid and resistant to jet fuel, aircraft hydraulic fluid, and cleaning and degreasing solvents. Anti-skid surfaces shall prevent slipping and allow maintainers to kneel, crouch, and lie down without causing minor injuries such as abrasions during aircraft maintenance. OSHA/AFOSH kick-plates shall be provided around perimeter of the stand and can be installed on any stand when the adjacent stand has been removed. Decking shall follow the slope of the aircraft wing without utilizing steps and shall also be continuous. <br>  <br> In addition, we will be looking for an option to have fall protection systems, if not already available, are procured with the stands.  We will want a single vendor that can provide maintenance platforms, stands and fall protection systems with harnesses for personnel walking on wings, fuselage or tail sections of the aircraft.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District intends to extend  firm-fixed-price with Economic Price Adjustment(EPA) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), sole sourcing to the current BPA holders under W912DR-09-A-0004 (Cartus Corporation), W912DR-09-A-0005 (Franconia Real Estate Services, Inc. dba Re/Max Allegiance Relocation Services), W912DR-09-A-0006 (WHR Group, Inc.) and W912DR-09-A-0007 (TRC Global Solutions, Inc.).  Extension awards will be made on or before 17 May 2014, under the authority FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source (or a limited number of responsible sources) and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <br>    <br>  The four current incumbent DNRP BPA holders are highly specialized service suppliers and are the only capable sources available for the imminent extension start date and short performance period contemplated with the BPA and program knowledge, trained staff, system access and service capability to provide the required services timely, properly and consistently.   <br>    <br>  These BPAs were obtained through competition and their rates were deemed to be competitive with the rest of the marketplace at the time of award. Those rates remain in effect today and are still considered competitive. Also DoD requires accurate, concise, and timely reports to monitor contractor activity, manage and evaluate the DNRP and the contract, and provide DoD and component management with program information. Contractors are required to complete electronic status reports on acquired properties and properties under management as requested/scheduled utilizing NRPO's internet enabled electronic program management system. The training required becoming familiar and proficient with this reporting system would result in unacceptable lost time before new contractors were fully functional and additional start up costs and operating costs for new contractors.  <br>    <br>  There are no practical alternatives to utilization of other than the current BPA holders. The short available lead time prior to the requested BPA extension start date is not sufficient to publish advance notice and to complete solicitation of other sources and then make new awards. A six month maximum term BPA opportunity would attract few, if any, potential contractors, and any service suppliers other than incumbent contractors would require start up time for staffing, training, system access, and BPA workflow knowledge that would result in unacceptable delays in authorizing/initiating contract services for DoD components and their transferring employees.  <br>    <br>  Awarding these services under a new contract would cause significant impacts to the Government. These include, but are not limited to impacts caused by not having a trained and experience contractor workforce in place to provide support to the DNRP program, as well as financial and other related issues. The Government could incur financial injury as a result of duplication of costs associated with providing services, training, augmentation of supplies and materials should another vendor be awarded this effort. Schedule delays will be incurred as well, which will have a direct and adverse impact upon DoD's mission in support of DNRP. It would take a minimum of ninety (90) days to recruit and train the new personnel required to perform DNRP services using new vendors.  <br>    <br>  Market research was conducted as part of the new effort to assess other possible courses of action, and it has be determined that a Full and Open competition is the most viable approach for the long term DNRP support requirements. Market Research was not separately conducted for the proposed six month extension, because, as discussed above, there are only limited sources, the current providers, who can provide the required services within the required timeframe.   <br>    <br>  The NAICS code is 531210 with a small business size of $7,000,000.00. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is based upon the excessive cost to the Government in replacing current Government requirement and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. The Government shall not reimburse interested sources for any information provided. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice and any information provided will not be used as part of any subsequent solicitation requirement. All responses shall be sent via electronic e-mail to the POC, Karen Truxal at Karen.Truxal@usace.army.mil by May 2, 2014 at 11:00AM EST.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  <br>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Baltimore District intends to extend  firm-fixed-price with Economic Price Adjustment(EPA) Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs), sole sourcing to the current BPA holders under W912DR-09-A-0004 (Cartus Corporation), W912DR-09-A-0005 (Franconia Real Estate Services, Inc. dba Re/Max Allegiance Relocation Services), W912DR-09-A-0006 (WHR Group, Inc.) and W912DR-09-A-0007 (TRC Global Solutions, Inc.).  Extension awards will be made on or before 17 May 2014, under the authority FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source (or a limited number of responsible sources) and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  <br>    <br>  The four current incumbent DNRP BPA holders are highly specialized service suppliers and are the only capable sources available for the imminent extension start date and short performance period contemplated with the BPA and program knowledge, trained staff, system access and service capability to provide the required services timely, properly and consistently.   <br>    <br>  These BPAs were obtained through competition and their rates were deemed to be competitive with the rest of the marketplace at the time of award. Those rates remain in effect today and are still considered competitive. Also DoD requires accurate, concise, and timely reports to monitor contractor activity, manage and evaluate the DNRP and the contract, and provide DoD and component management with program information. Contractors are required to complete electronic status reports on acquired properties and properties under management as requested/scheduled utilizing NRPO's internet enabled electronic program management system. The training required becoming familiar and proficient with this reporting system would result in unacceptable lost time before new contractors were fully functional and additional start up costs and operating costs for new contractors.  <br>    <br>  There are no practical alternatives to utilization of other than the current BPA holders. The short available lead time prior to the requested BPA extension start date is not sufficient to publish advance notice and to complete solicitation of other sources and then make new awards. A six month maximum term BPA opportunity would attract few, if any, potential contractors, and any service suppliers other than incumbent contractors would require start up time for staffing, training, system access, and BPA workflow knowledge that would result in unacceptable delays in authorizing/initiating contract services for DoD components and their transferring employees.  <br>    <br>  Awarding these services under a new contract would cause significant impacts to the Government. These include, but are not limited to impacts caused by not having a trained and experience contractor workforce in place to provide support to the DNRP program, as well as financial and other related issues. The Government could incur financial injury as a result of duplication of costs associated with providing services, training, augmentation of supplies and materials should another vendor be awarded this effort. Schedule delays will be incurred as well, which will have a direct and adverse impact upon DoD's mission in support of DNRP. It would take a minimum of ninety (90) days to recruit and train the new personnel required to perform DNRP services using new vendors.  <br>    <br>  Market research was conducted as part of the new effort to assess other possible courses of action, and it has be determined that a Full and Open competition is the most viable approach for the long term DNRP support requirements. Market Research was not separately conducted for the proposed six month extension, because, as discussed above, there are only limited sources, the current providers, who can provide the required services within the required timeframe.   <br>    <br>  The NAICS code is 531210 with a small business size of $7,000,000.00. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which shall be considered by the agency before the intended award date. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action is based upon the excessive cost to the Government in replacing current Government requirement and is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested sources who submit data are responsible for appropriately marking information if it is proprietary in nature. The Government shall not reimburse interested sources for any information provided. No requests for capability briefings will be honored as a result of this notice and any information provided will not be used as part of any subsequent solicitation requirement. All responses shall be sent via electronic e-mail to the POC, Karen Truxal at Karen.Truxal@usace.army.mil by May 2, 2014 at 11:00AM EST.  Telephonic inquiries will not be honored.  <br>

<DESC>Work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of the Southwestern Division (SWD) consisting of Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the primary responsible agent for the Corps of Engineers via established agreements. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed the geographical area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. If capacity is used outside the SWD geographic boundaries for other than the Division's nationwide customers, prior MSC coordination will be made or capacity will be granted tothe appropriate geographic District. <br /><br />Any work executed under these MATOCs is limited to the geographic boundaries of SWD and those nationwide customers where SWD has been designated as the -One Door to the Corps- via established MOAs. However, because SWD services customers whose boundaries exceed this geographic area, it is necessary to provide for maximum flexibility to ensure that possible execution gaps can be covered. Therefore, it is anticipated that these contracts will execute an estimated 15% of the total MATOC capacity outside of the established geographical area or for nationwide customers identified above as long as capacity exists and the contractors agree to perform the requirement. <br /><br />WHEN SOLICITED, IT WILL BE ISSUED UNDER RFP NUMBER: W9126G-13-R-0014 <br /><br />Pre-solicitation Synopsis Notice Small Business Request for Proposal (RFP) for Multiple Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) for Construction Services for the United States Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) in Southwestern Division (SWD) and its surrounding areas consisting of Arizona, Arkansas, California, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. <br /><br />The Contract Specialist point of contact for this anticipated solicitation will be Ms. Jennifer Fox at 817-886-1220, email Jennifer.R.Fox@usace.army.mil. <br /><br />FOR INFORMATION ONLY: This Synopsis is ONLY A NOTIFICATION that a solicitation is anticipated and forthcoming.

If option 1 is not viable and the evaluation criteria have been reviewed then SWD reserves the right to solicit an additional MATOC pool only for the amount of the un-awarded capacity. New market research will be conducted to determine the appropriate set-aside, if any, for the MATOC for the unawarded capacity.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification to a Previous Presolicitation Notice- Request for Information (RFI) VA118-14-I-0264 - LEC Services for Region 3 is to extend the response due date to May 16, 2014 at 2:00 PM EST and to post questions and answers to the RFI.

1.	Place of Performance.   Region 3, VISN 7's LEC services were competed and awarded under a stand-alone contract.  Therefore, we suggest the VISN 7 sites be removed from this RFP.

ANSWER:  This is for market research purposes.   An anticipated award would be an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract(s), therefore VISN 7 is requested.

2.	Service Types:  Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), OpteWAN.  This RFI is for VA Region 3 LEC services.   MPLS and OpteWAN are not LEC services.   Please explain the inclusion of MPLS/OpteWAN and/or remove it from the RFP.

ANSWER:   This is for market research purposes.   These services are available through a local LEC/Vendor.  Yes, they are on the Networx Contract;  however,  sometimes it is more cost effective to use a LEC/Vendor and not the Networx contract.  The Networx contract is not mandatory at this time, therefore these services will remain in the PWS.

3.	SDPs.  The RFI asks if a vendor can deliver to all Region 3 SDPs.  There may be inside wiring or extensions to be delivered.   Please clarify if the government requires delivery of local services to the SDP, which may require extended DMARC and wiring to reach the SDP as additional costs may be associated with these extensions. 
ANSWER:   Installation of services is only anticipated to the DMARC at each SDP.  Inside wiring is the responsibility of the local OIT staff.   We do however realize that there may be occasions (limited) where extension of the building DMARC to the VA DMARC may be required.  VA will include a line item for this just in case it might be needed. 
As part of your responses, please indicate the SDP/services which would be an issue and place an explanation in the comment column.

4.	Site surveys.   Site surveys may be required to determine the wiring extensions.   We suggest the VA have inside wiring site surveys be a separate line item.

ANSWER:   This is for market research purposes.  As part of your responses, please indicate the SDP/services which would be an issue and place an explanation in the comment column.

5.	ILEC.  Per the RFI's Question 10, please note that the industry standard definition for an ILEC is Independent Local Exchange Carrier.  

ANSWER:  Duly noted.

6.	Would VA consider a one-week extension of the due date for responses?

ANSWER:  The response due date is extended until May 16, 2014 at 2:00 PM EST

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION 
FOR AN EXCEPTION TO FAIR OPPORTUNITY  


1.  Contracting Activity:	Department of Veterans Affairs
                                         	Office of Acquisition Operations
     	Technology Acquisition Center
     	260 Industrial Way West
     	Eatontown, New Jersey 07724
      		
2.  Description of Action:  The proposed action is for the placement of a 12 month base period firm fixed-price Task Order (TO) that will be issued under the Product Development (PD) Leadership Support Services (LSS) Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Contract, Number VA118-14-D-0072 with T3 Technologies, LLC (DBA T3 TigerTech) for the procurement of Program Planning and Oversight (PP&O) Schedule Support Services for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  

3.  Description of the Supplies or Services:  The proposed action is for  PP&O Schedule Support Services at VA.  Specifically, this requirement is for project management reporting processes across VA PD portfolios, programs and projects; defining and supporting development/maintenance of project schedule minimum requirements and related health check reporting and metrics associated with these processes; periodically reviewing interim results; and identifying and executing adjustments to ensure achievement of the planned outcome.  The total estimated value of the order is $996,739.50.

4.  Statutory Authority:  The statutory authority permitting an exception to fair opportunity is Section 41 U.S.C. 4106(c)(4) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.505(b)(2)(i)(D); entitled "It is necessary to place an order to satisfy a minimum guarantee."     

5.  Rationale Supporting Use of Authority Cited Above:  The proposed source is T3 TigerTech, 1800 Alexander Bell Dr. Reston, VA 20190.  Solicitation VA118-13-R-0220 was issued as 100% Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) set-aside utilizing the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website on August 21, 2013.  Three offerors were chosen to receive an award in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Basis for Award of the solicitation.  Included in the solicitation and resultant contracts were both FAR clause 52.216-22, Indefinite Quantity, and FAR clause 52.216-19, Order Limitations which established the Government's requirement to award a minimum guarantee under each PD LSS contract.  In accordance with the requirements of FAR 52.216-22 and FAR 52.216-19, this order is being issued to T3 TigerTech to satisfy the minimum guarantee for Contract VA118-14-D-0072.  T3 TigerTech's services were reviewed by the Government's technical experts and have been determined to satisfy the requirements required by this action.  

6.  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  There is no competition anticipated for this action as it is being issued to meet the mandatory minimum guarantee for this IDIQ contract.  In accordance with FAR 5.301 and 16.505(b)(2)(ii)(D), this action will be synopsized at award on FBO and the justification will be made publicly available.   

7.  Actions to Increase Competition:  All TO's under PD LSS IDIQ shall be competed unless an exception to fair opportunity applies and is approved in accordance with FAR Subpart 16.505.  

8.  Market Research:  Market Research was conducted by the Contract Specialist and VA technical experts who reviewed the PD LSS technical requirements.  Based upon the market research conducted, it was determined that the services offered on PD LSS Contract VA118-14-D-0072 with T3 TigerTech satisfied the requirements associated with this procurement.  Therefore, this TO was selected to satisfy the mandatory minimum guarantee for this IDIQ contract and no further market research was conducted.
