<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is soliciting proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for innovative research and development projects to advance the capabilities of Counterterrorism and Forensic Science.  The BAA Proposal Information Packet is currently available and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the BAA document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will also be distributed solely through the FBO site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This acquisition is being issued as BAA-0034104.  The FBI Laboratory is recognized as a world leader in the application of scientific methods to the examination of physical evidence in criminal investigations.  Since its inception in 1932, the FBI Laboratory has striven to enhance its services to the law enforcement and criminal justice communities through the research, development, and deployment of new or advanced forensic techniques and protocols.  The FBI Laboratory conducts research to develop new techniques of forensic analysis.  The FBI Laboratory must be in a position to provide prompt, accurate, and thorough responses to the thousands of requests it receives annually.  However, as the scientific, technical, and legal aspects of forensic science continue to become more complex, it has become increasingly challenging for the FBI to stay on the cutting edge of technology.  In order for the FBI Laboratory to continue to serve as the technical leader in the criminal justice community, it turns to outside expertise to address advanced forensic applications and initiatives.  A more detailed description of each area of interest and format of submissions is included in the Proposal Information Packet.  The Proposal Information Packet describes the process for proposal submission/evaluation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation with regard to this BAA, nor does the issuance of the BAA obligate the Government to fund any subsequently invited proposals nor pay any proposal preparation costs.  Although no portion of this announcement is set&#64979;aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) participation, the Government encourages applications from these institutions.  Proposals from all responsible sources capable of satisfying the Governments needs may be submitted and shall be considered.  This notice constitutes a BAA as authorized by FAR 6.102 (d) (2) (i).

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is soliciting proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for innovative research and development projects to streamline and automate analysis of forensic biological samples.  In the United States, there is a substantial backlog of samples requiring short tandem repeat (STR) DNA marker analysis.  Approximately 600,000 convicted offender samples and 180,000 no-suspect (Aunsub@) case samples currently remain to be analyzed nationwide.  To address this issue, Congress enacted The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, which focuses on defeating the backlog by providing additional manpower and instrumentation for use with existing STR typing methodology.  While the current STR methodologies are valid and accurate, they are also labor-intensive and time-consuming.  This BAA focuses on introducing automation into the process flow for analyzing forensic biological samples.  This is another approach to addressing the backlog of samples and preventing the backlog from recurring.  The BAA Proposal Information Packet is currently available and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the BAA document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions.

<DESC>NA Project consists of two separate features of work to be constructed along the south shore of Ponce de Leon Inlet and  includes a base bid and one option.  The Base Bid consists of constructing a 1,000-foot seaward extension of the south jetty to the east.  The extension will tie into the existing south jetty and will be tapered to provide a smooth transition.  The extension crest elevation will be +7 feet, MLW, which matches the crest elevation of the existing south jetty.  The crest width will be 15 feet w ith a front and back slope of 1 vertical on 1.5 horizontal.  Armor stone thickness will be 10 feet with core layer thickness dependent upon existing ground elevation.  A 30-foot wide scour apron will be constructed over the toe of the extension on the insi de (north side) of the jetty and will vary in thickness depending upon bottom elevation, top elevation will be set at Ã¢Â€Â“4 feet, MLW.  Both extension and scour apron will rest on a 2-foot thick layer of bedding stone that will be placed over non-woven g eotextile filter fabric.  The base of the structure will be at elevation Ã¢Â€Â“10 feet, MLW, or on existing bottom, whichever is deeper.  Armor stone size will range from 7 to 12.5 tons and will have a density of 165 pounds per cubic foot.  Core stone will  range from 500 to 2,500 pounds and will have a density of 165 pounds per cubic foot.  The bedding stone will have a density of 140 pounds per cubic foot.  Total quantities of materials required for construction of the structure are approximately:  32,800 tons of armor stone, 13,000 tons of core stone, 10,500 tons of bedding stone, and 11,800 square yards of filter fabric.  The Option Bid Item consists of constructing a concrete walkway over approximately 650 feet of the existing south jetty and over approx imately 550 feet of the new 1,000-foot jetty extension.   Total quantities of materials required for construction of the walkway are approximately:  1,300 tons of core stone, 100 tons of chinking stone, 160 cubic yards of non-reinforced concrete, 110 cubic  yards of reinforced concrete, and 2,850 linear feet of aluminum handrails.  This item of work is for the local sponsor, the Ponce de Leon Port Authority.  Magnitude of construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00.
