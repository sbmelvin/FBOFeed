<DESC>NASA/HQ intends to negotiate a service contract with the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), for services to the government of the U.S. such as contemplated by Public Law 98-257 and as discussed in the proposed 2004 appropriations committee bill language. The Appropriations Act which the committee report underlies has not been enacted; however, proposed language states that the Committee has allocated $2,000,000. within the amounts appropriated to NASA for a contract with the National Academy of Public Administration to conduct a study about NASA's organizational, programmatic, and personnel structures, particularly the field and headquarters organizational structures, business processes, human resource management, and program structure and operations. Contract will include this proposed Committee study as well as other studies of similar nature required by NASA.  Contract is intended to be for five years with a contract ceiling amount of $5 million. This is a sole source procurement under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source.  NAPA consists of an elected membership with extensive, high-level experience in public administration, both from a management and an academic standpoint. NAPA has a broad base of contacts throughout the public sector, which can be drawn upon quickly in researching problems and issues.  As an organization with extensive resources, including scholars and practioners of public administration, NAPA offers a uniquely objective, independent assessment.  This independence enables the Government to receive an unbias assessment in the areas of management and policy issues.  Their diverse backgrounds provide an unequal wealth of expertise that provides NAPA the ability to improve the effectiveness of government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  See Notes 26 and 22.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.  See NASA Specific Note "B". Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:  The General Services Administration intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with FISHER CUSTOM COMMUNICATIONS, INC. located in Torrance, CA for Mast Clamped Current Probes (MCCPs) for Navy Ships.  The MCCP is used for the High Frequency (HF) communications receive function.  The MCCP replaces whip antennas currently used on the ship for this function. The subject device is a current transformer. It replaces a receive antenna with a clamp-on current sensor that clamps around the mast of a DDG class ship.  In effect, the mast of the ship becomes the antenna with the receive sensor providing the interface transducer between the HF receiver and the mast. The receiving sensor offers equivalent HF link performance and eliminates the  operational or maintenance penalties of conventional antennas. This device has undergone all testing and approvals required for shipboard use and is designated  an AS-4543/URC antenna.

This MCCP will be installed in the near future and will be based on a design that has already been tested by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center San Diego (SSC San Diego), San Diego California, which is DoD's Technical Direction Agent for HF antenna design capabilities.  FISHER CUSTOM COMMUNICATIONS’ MCCP was determined to specifically address the unique requirements of the design being utilized for Navy ships.

The hardware specified above has been previously supplied by FISHER CUSTOM COMMUNICATIONS, INC. To maintain consistency, eliminate additional testing, and maintain multi-range compatibility, FISHER CUSTOM COMMUNICATIONS, INC. is the only source of supply for this product and is solely capable of responding to ongoing support requirements. 

The proposed action is for supplies/services for which the government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR6.302-1.  The government believes that only one responsible source can provide the supplies/services that will satisfy the agency requirements.  This notice is not a request for competitive quotes but all interested parties must submit a capability statement that sufficiently describes their qualifications, capabilities, and previous experience related to fulfilling a similar requirement via e-mail to joe.pechinko@gsa.gov by 4:00 p.m., PST, October 28, 2003. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Office of Naval Research (ONR) Littoral Combat and Power Projection (LCPP) Future Naval Capability endeavors to provide certain critical enabling capabilities in order to achieve the concept of Expeditionary Maneuver Warfare (EMW) as it builds on the Ship To Objective Maneuver (STOM) principles. The key to achieving STOM is the ability to conduct dynamic planning and adaptive execution across a widely dispersed battlefield. Enabled by tactical over-the-horizon communications, information management, and data-flow optimization that constrains bandwidth requirements to the “right-size” pipe, an improved network architecture that supports appropriate reach-back to the integrated intelligence databases and resources, and real-time Information, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR), each level of command will be able to achieve relative situational awareness. This increased situational awareness will, in turn, enhance a commander’s ability to maneuver his forces most effectively to avoid enemy anti-access capabilities and force concentrations, and to coordinate expeditionary fires most appropriately against point and area targets.  Please see the attached document for the full solicitation.  This BAA is also avaiable at www.onr.navy.mil/02/baa.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION, SAFECOM PROGRAM,
Technologies and Processes Enabling Public Safety  Interoperability____----


INTRODUCTION----

The SAFECOM Program (SAFECOM) is soliciting comments and input from qualified vendors and the academic research community regarding technology concepts and existing or under-development products or services to provide for the interoperability of public safety communications.  SAFECOM is asking for 5-7 page White Papers describing the technology product, service, or concept to be submitted by November 14, 2003.  White Papers should be submitted to safecomprogram@dhs.gov.____

SAFECOM is the umbrella program within the Federal government intended to help local, tribal, State and Federal public safety agencies improve public safety response through more effective, efficient, interoperable wireless communications.  The SAFECOM program was created by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as a high priority e-government initiative and is housed within the Science and Technology Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  SAFECOM is currently working with existing Federal communications initiatives and key public safety stakeholders to facilitate the development of better technologies and processes for the cross-jurisdictional and cross-disciplinary coordination of existing communications systems and future networks.  A public safety practitioner driven program, SAFECOM has a customer base of over 44,000 local and State public safety agencies and organizations, in addition to over 100 Federal agencies involved in public safety response.____  

This Request for Information (RFI) is intended to increase SAFECOM’s awareness of the technology available, under development or in concept that will help realize the program’s long-term goal:  The creation of a “system of systems” by which public safety across disciplines and jurisdictions will be fully interoperable when necessary.  A panel of SAFECOM representatives will review submissions to this RFI and select respondents may be invited to present to a board of these representatives to answer questions regarding submitted products, services, or technology concepts.  A Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) under which SAFECOM may fund demonstration projects undertaken jointly by industry and public safety agencies will likely follow this RFI.____


----BACKGROUND---- 

Public safety wireless “interoperability” is the ability of public safety service and support providers to communicate with each other via voice, data or video, on demand, in real time, when needed and as authorized.  Inadequate and unreliable wireless communications are serious issues plaguing public safety.  In many instances, agencies lack the technology necessary to perform their mission-critical duties.  Such agencies are unable to share critical voice and/or data information in routine day-to-day operations, within pre-established task forces and in large-scale events such as acts of terrorism and natural disasters.  This lack of interoperability comes at a high price: Property may be damaged or even lives lost when public safety agencies cannot effectively communicate.____

According to a report issued by the National Task Force on Interoperability (NTFI) in January 2003, there are many factors-- political, technological, and financial-- that hamper public safety interoperability today, including:____

•	Incompatible and aging communications equipment in use across the 44,000 agencies in the United Sates, ranging from newer, digital systems to 30 year old analog systems____

•	Limited and fragmented budget cycles and funding at the federal level (where grant funding agencies have not previously coordinated a common set of requirements) and at the local level (where individual agencies often have different planning cycles, procurement processes and technology requirements)____

•	Limited and fragmented planning and cooperation among public safety agencies due in part to the limited resources of small and sometimes volunteer organizations____

•	Limited and fragmented radio spectrum dedicated to public safety____

•	Limited equipment standards for public safety communications which would incorporate universally recognized, fully open, implementable standards____


----TECHNOLOGIES OF INTEREST----

SAFECOM is requesting information from qualified vendors and the research community for products, service models or enabling technologies that can accomplish one or more of the following functional requirements:____

•	Interconnect disparate voice and/or data public safety communications systems____

•	Extend and/or enhance public safety communications systems coverage (including but not limited to improved spectrum management, signal coverage, system reliability)____

•	Extend and/or enhance capabilities to public safety communications systems (including, but not limited to extension of battery life, user/message prioritization)____ 

SAFECOM and its associated programs have identified a number of parameters expected to characterize the technologies and processes submitted in response to this RFI.  While submissions are not necessarily expected to respond to all of these considerations, SAFECOM would like to identify concepts that fulfill or enable as many as possible. Evaluations will be based on these parameters.____

These parameters include:____
•	Open Standards rather than proprietary solutions____
•	Leveraging of “mainstream” commercial technology____
•	Backwards compatibility with legacy systems and technologies____
•	Scalability to function in both day-to-day public safety response and in major event situations with small and large number of responders and varying functional requirements of different types of subscribers (e.g. police, fire, EMS) and levels of government (local, State and Federal)____
•	High end-to-end Quality of Service and performance characteristics____
•	High degree of reliability and redundancy____
•	Useful for day-to-day operations____
•	Limited power requirements____
•	Flexibility in ergonomics / ease of use____
•	Inherent and supportable elements of security____
•	Inherent and supportable elements of privacy____
•	Acceptable Total Cost of Ownership for public safety agencies____
•	Interoperability across public safety disciplines and all levels of government____
•	Spectral efficiency____
•	Non-Repudiation____
•	Interoperable across all Public Safety frequency bands____

Stage of Development:____
SAFECOM is interested in receiving submissions from industry that illustrate any new or developing technologies that can provide solutions, full or partial, towards public safety interoperability.  Information on technologies in all stages of development is welcome and sought after, whether the products are already on the shelf, in development, or merely a concept on the drawing table.  It is asked that industry clearly articulate the stage of development of any technologies in the submissions.____  


----WHITE PAPER CONTENTS:----

In response to this Request, white papers of 5-7 pages should be submitted which cover:____

1.	Background, Current State, and Categorization of Proposed Technology Describe in adequate detail the specific technology or solution being proposed for SAFECOM consideration, the current state of its development, any current deployments of the technology within the public safety environment, and how the technology or solution compares with the parameters outlined above.____

2.	Applicability of Proposed Technology to Public Safety Communications   Explain how the proposed technology or solution would be deployed in a public safety communications setting, and how public safety officers would gain access to and use it.____

3.	Timeline and Cost to Develop   Provide a rough estimate of the time and cost to develop the technology for utilization.____


----SUBMISSION PROCESS:----

In response to this Request, white papers of 5-7 pages should be submitted electronically by Friday November 14, 2003 to____

safecomprogram@dhs.gov____

Authority 10 USC Sec. 2358 Research and Development Projects 10 USC Sec. 2371 Research Projects: Transactions Other Than Contracts and Grants SPAWAR SSC-SD intends to enter into cooperative agreements, contracts, grants or ?other transactions? with qualified sources to perform research development, integration, test and evaluation of advanced technology within guidelines of FAR 35.016.  It is possible to fund none of the proposals, or funding permitting, fund all the proposals.  It is also possible to fund part of the proposals.  Each individual white paper and proposal is reviewed on its own merit.  Proposals will be evaluated individually as selectable or non-selectable for funding based on the evaluation criteria set forth in this BAA. Points of Contact Questions of a contractual nature shall be directed to the Contract Specialist, Oralee Martin, (619) 553-5347, email: mailto:oralee.martin@navy.mil or Contracting Officer Mr. James E. Smith, (619) 553-7504, email: james.e.smith@navy.mil.  No hard copy version of this solicitation will be available. White Paper Submittal Offeror?s are invited to submit white papers that will be reviewed to identify valuable research for further consideration.  If a proposed area of research and the accompanying research approach is considered potentially valuable, and within funding limits, SPAWAR SSC-SD will then request a full proposal. White papers exceeding $20 million will not be accepted.  The instructions for the preparation and submission of full proposals are contained herein. White papers are limited to six pages, including all figures, tables, attachments as well as the estimated annual schedule and cost. Reviewers will not load software or simulations in the conduct of white paper reviews. However, web sites containing concise simulations or other information not readily represented in the static format of a document may be hyperlinked from the white paper. Innovative approaches to information presentation are encouraged. White papers shall include the name, address, voice phone number, facsimile number, and email address of the proposing organization and the principal point of contact, and of other organizations participating as part of the research team.  The white paper shall include the following sections: a clear statement of the problem to be solved, a rational for the proposed work, an overview of the approach to be taken, a summary of the evidence that the approach will work, a general assessment of the value gained if the work is successful, a specific description of the demonstration that will show enhanced value to a DoD application, a product development and demonstration schedule, and an estimate of the cost structure for the project. For readability, most text based information should be no less than 10 point Times New Roman, although other fonts and sizes may be utilized as necessary in tables, headings, drawings, other art, etc. White papers shall be produced using Microsoft Word, Excel and/or Power Point, or may be submitted as Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) files. White papers lacking key information or sections substantially deviating from the required format will be returned without technical review. SPAWAR SSC-SD will acknowledge receipt of white papers, and will notify offerors whether a full proposal is requested. All White Papers and Proposals shall be UNCLASSIFIED. Selection and Evaluation Criteria Full proposals will be considered to be either selectable or non-selectable based on their evaluation in accordance with the criteria herein.  Offerors will be promptly notified of the evaluation results. Only selectable proposals will be considered for funding.  Not all proposals deemed selectable will be funded.  Decisions to fund selectable proposals will be based on funds availability, overall scientific and technical merit, and potential contribution to the SPAWAR SSC-SD mission.  Proposals may be considered for funding for a period of up to one year from notification of selectability. The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received.  Proposals identified for funding may result in a procurement contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or ?other transaction? depending upon the nature of the work proposed, the required degree of interaction between the parties, and other factors. It is the policy of SPAWAR SSC-SD to ensure impartial, equitable, comprehensive evaluations of all proposals and to select the source (or sources) whose offer(s) meets the Government technical and policy goals.  In order to provide the desired evaluation, two or more qualified Government personnel will conduct a technical review of each submission and will convene panels of Government experts in the appropriate areas when necessary.  The consolidated reports produced during these reviews will be provided to the Contracting/Grants Officer.  These reports will indicate those offerors with whom negotiations and/or discussions should be conducted.  That will also include questions arising from the reviews and, when appropriate issues that need to be resolved prior to award. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since they are not submitted in accordance with a common statement of work.  SPAWAR SSC-SD?s intent is to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.  Evaluation of white papers and full proposals will be accomplished through the technical review of each white paper or full proposal utilizing the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (1) overall scientific and technical merit; (2) potential contributions and relevance to SPAWAR SSC-SD mission in relation to meeting the objectives of the Advanced Systems Division and Ocean Systems Division efforts; (3) offeror?s capabilities and related experience; (4) plans and capability to accomplish technology transition and (5) cost realism.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport - US Navy currently has a portable acoustic range offshore of Little Stirrup Cay (Coco Cay) in the Bahamas.  Utilization of this range requires that a support ship be moored in a 4-point moor, and connected via a cable to a range of underwater sensors, Portable Tracking System (PTS).  In an effort to reduce the operational cost of this asset by eliminating the need for a support ship, the Navy requires the installation of an interface between the “shore end” of the acoustic range sensors and a shore location on Little Stirrup Cay.  This interface will be comprised of an optical-electrical-mechanical (OEM) cable and junction boxes.  The OEM cable and in-water junction will provide a permanent shore connection for the PTS.  The government has previously obtained all the permits and necessary environmental regulations to proceed forward with the installation.  There shall be no requirements for the contractor to obtain permits to install the cable. Work shall be performed on and offshore of Little Stirrup Cay, Bahamas and Portsmouth, Virginia.  A Cost Plus Fixed Fee Completion type contract is anticipated. Award will be based on the Best Value to the Government. Offers will be evaluated on two evaluation factors, TECHNICAL CAPABILITY (subfactors: Technical Approach, Past Performance) and COST.  The period of performance is 180 calendar days from the date of award.  This solicitation is issued on an unrestricted basis. All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the government. Telephone requests will not be honored. NAICS:  541330.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Magnetic Resonance Imaging Research Facility (MRI RF) plans to procure on a sole source basis with Medrad Inc., One Medrad Drive, Indianola, PA 15051 an MRI Spectris Solaris MR Injection System and injectors manufactured by Medrad.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.  The purpose of the In Vivo NMR Research Center may be broadly defined as a service center for the scientific community to work toward the advancement of In Vivo NMR technology, its application to animal physiology, and ultimately, its application in the clinical setting.  The NMR In Vivo Center has a 1.5 Tesla Magnet.  This magnet room requires an MRI contrast injector to enable NINDS to perform contrast enhanced scans.  The magnetic field in this room has an affect on the function of equipment used in the environment.  An injector, which has not been specifically manufactured for this environment will not function properly.  The Medrad injector has FDA approval and meets the requirement of the Joint Commission On Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO).  New regulation for JCAHO state that all equipment used on patients must have battery backup in the event of electrical loss.   The NMR center has the Medrad Spectris MR injectors in all the magnet rooms.   Currently NINDS uses them to deliver contrast media to patients so that they can better visualize brain tumors, perfusion of the heart, kidneys and major blood vessels.  These dynamic contrast examinations are necessary to provide accurate and diagnostic MRI examinations.  Medrad meets this requirement.  The Medrad injectors are currently being used in the Clinical Center and all have a record of high performance and dependability.   Medrad is the only source known to NINDS that manufactures the MRI Spectris Solaris MR Injection System and contrast injectors that have been designed to operate in a magnetic field environment.  Because NINDS must ensure patient safety, they cannot have equipment in the scan room, which could be attracted to the magnet field.  In addition to safety reasons NINDS requires the equipment, which will not degrade image quality or malfunction due to the affects of a magnetic field.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NINDS to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EST, November 4, 2003.  If you have any questions they must be submitted in writing to Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent, at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax 301-402-4513.   A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Solicitation number must be cited on all correspondence, NCI-40002-NG

<DESC>PLEASE CONTACT THE PROCUREMENT REPRESENTATIVE LISTED BELOW:
Attention: Larry Coffey
Westinghouse Savannah Company
Building 730-4B, Room 2162
Aiken, SC 29808
Tel. No.: (803) 952-8855
e-mail: lawrence.coffey@srs.gov

Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC) solicits responses from interested and qualified parties that address high priority technical needs identified by WSRC for the Monitored Natural Attenuation and Enhanced Passive Remediation of Chlorinated Solvents project.  These technical priorities focus on areas where enhancements and/or innovations will either lead to a better understanding of the natural processes associated with MNA or improved methods and strategies for characterization and long-term monitoring associated with MNA of chlorinated solvents.  A description of these high priority technical needs is located http://www.srs.gov/general/busiops/PMMD/PDFs/RFI_091203.pdf.  The objective of this request for information is to secure and evaluate responses that incorporate recent science and expanded conceptual approaches in a manner that allows MNA/EPR to be more effectively utilized.  This is not a request for proposal or an invitation for bid and is not to be construed as a commitment by WSRC to award one or more resulting subcontracts.  

The MNA/EPR of Chlorinated Solvents project is a DOE HQ Technology Alternative Project managed by WSRC at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, SC.  The project is narrowly focused to provide the scientific and policy support to facilitate implementing appropriate passive cleanup and cost effective monitoring strategies leading to responsible completion of active remediation activities at high risk DOE waste sites.  The objective of the project is to examine opportunities to incorporate recent science and expanded conceptual approaches to encourage the use of MNA/EPR.  The end product will be a technical guidance document that will provide additional information for implementing MNA for chlorinated solvents.  

A pre-response conference will be held on November 10, 2003 at 9 AM at the Savannah River Site.  The meeting will consist of a technical presentation of the project and the identification of expectation for the research studies.  The location for the conference will be provided to you when you confirm attendance.  The purpose of the conference will be to familiarize interested parties with the MNA/EPR project.  Attendees must be U.S. citizens and be able to provide picture identification to allow access to SRS facilities.  Each interested party may have no more than 2 individuals attend the conference and must provide the name, social security number, company and telephone number for each attendee to Karen Vangelas at Karen.vangelas@srs.gov. 10 calendar days prior to the conference.  

Responses must be submitted to Karen Vangelas no later than December 3, 2003 at the following address:

Westinghouse Savannah River Company
Building 773-42A Room 253
Aiken, SC 29808

WSRC may request supplemental information to a respondent’s package.  WSRC will provide a written assessment of each respondent response that will address its technical viability.  Once viable responses have been identified, WSRC intends to issue request for proposals approximately January 13, 2004, with subcontracts to be awarded approximately February 23, 2004.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for the services of a contractor to provide technical assistance and training to Youth Transition Process Demonstration (YTPD) Cooperative Agreement grantees.  SSA awarded seven cooperative agreements to state agencies and universities in six states to develop service delivery systems to help youth with disabilities transition from school to work.   The grantees will establish partnerships to provide a broad array of transition related services to youth ages 14-25 who: 1) receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments on the basis of their own disability; 2) are at risk of becoming eligible for SSI because their disabilities are progressive; 3) have a prognosis for decreased functioning; or 4) have existing disabling conditions at age 18 that would render them eligible except for deemed parental income.  The contractor shall provide continuous technical assistance to YTPD grantees, organize and conduct training for grantee personnel, and develop and carry out information exchange among YTPD grantees and their staff.  Technical assistance will cover a wide range of topics; however, the core task will be to provide assistance that will enable youth with disabilities to transition to employment by way of career development, job coaching, vocational preparation and by working with school systems, including post-secondary education.  In addition, the contractor shall assist YTPD grantees in developing collaborative relationships with states, national and local organizations, schools, tribes, public officials, service providers, families and youth with disabilities.  SSA anticipates awarding a cost reimbursement contract with a base period of performance of one year from the date of award with the inclusion of provisions for an additional four one-year option periods.  The NAICS code is 624110, with a size standard of $6 million.  Solicitation number SSA-RFP-04-1006, is scheduled for release on or about November 14, 2003, with proposals due 45 calendar days thereafter.  The solicitation will be available for downloading from the Federal Procurement website at www.fedbizopps.gov.  HARD COPIES OF THE RFP WILL NOT BE MAILED.  Telephone requests will not be honored and no bidders list will be maintained.  Potential offerors are responsible for accessing the FedBizOpps website to check the status of this requirement and to keep current with any amendments that may be issued.  Interested parties must respond to the solicitation in order to be considered for award of any resultant contract.  All questions must be submitted via email to barbara.hands@ssa.gov.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Contracting Agency, in support of the U. S. Army Aberdeen Test Center and the Army's Environmental Quality Technology Program (EQT), is soliciting innovative proposals through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) in the area of unexploded ord nance (UXO) detection and discrimination technologies.  Proposed technologies shall significantly improve sensing, positioning, analysis, and visualization that efficiently and effectively characterize sites that may contain surface, subsurface, and underw ater UXO. Specifically, the Government is seeking proposals to demonstrate ground based UXO Detection and Discrimination Technologies.  The technologies shall be demonstrated on the Standardized UXO Technology Demonstration Sites that have been established at Aberde en Proving Ground (APG) and Yuma Proving Ground (YPG).  Descriptions of each site are located on the web at: www.uxotestsites.org.    These test sites provide standard and nonstandard inert ordnance targets in a wide range of environmental, geophysical, and clutter conditions to allow performance to be rated and validated.  Performance shall be documented by means of metrics such as the systems Probability of Detection (Pd), False Alarm Rate (Pfd), Background Alarm rate, discrimination efficiency, site coverage rates and estimated survey costs.  The technologies shall also be demonstrated at the Active Response Site currently under development at APG.  The Active Response Site is a one-acre site located within an area that contains actual ordnance and clutter.  Performance at the Active Response S ite will be documented by the same metrics as the Standardized Site. Demonstration of existing and emerging technologies may include but are not limited to time and frequency domain EMI, high resolution, fully-polar metric GPR, magnetometers /gradiometers, multi-sensor fusion, automatic target recognition algorithms, and hi gh accuracy navigational and tracking systems.  SCOPE OF PROJECT:  Total funding for this project is estimated at $500,000 from which a total of 10 awards are envisioned.  It is anticipated that increased funding levels will occur in the following three fiscal years.  The program is expected to be initi ated in CY 03, however, the prospective submitter should be aware that there is no certainty in the funding or level of effort.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received. GENERAL INFORMATION:  Proposals shall address the following: 1) Detailed description and characterization of UXO Detection/Discrimination System, 2) Detailed description of navigational system to be utilized, 3) Proposed sited coverage of APG site, 4) Prop osed sited coverage of YPG, 5) Data processing description, 6) Detailed description of quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) measures to be employed, 7) Previous work experience, 8) Experience of Field Personnel, and 9) Cost schedule and mileston es for proposed demonstration. Teaming among academic and/or industrial partners are encouraged, however, this is not a requirement. In order to minimize the magnitude of the proposal preparation and review process, a proposal totaling no more than 20 pages shall be submitted.  The official release of the BAA, which includes additional information on the full proposal required format, w ill be posted on the internet at the Army Single Face to Industry (AFSI) Acquisition Business Web site on or about October 27, 2003.

<DESC>Availability of Solicitation The solicitation for the Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials is now available. The solicitation can be found at http://www.coe.faa.gov/ The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) intends to establish an Air Transportation Center of Excellence (COE) for Advanced Materials. The goal of this endeavor is to create a cost sharing partnership of academia, industry, and government that will initially focus on advanced materials research. The purpose is to forge a union of public sector (FAA, airport authorities, state/local governments, etc.), private sector (airlines, manufacturers, etc.), and academic institutions to create a world-class consortium that will identify solutions for existing and anticipated advanced materials problems.  The FAA expects that the COE shall perform basic research through engineering development and prototyping. To this end, the FAA is soliciting proposals from accredited institutions of higher education addressing the establishment of the aforementioned COE. The FAA intends to enter into cooperative agreements with the successful team members and thereafter award grants and delivery order contract(s) consisting of cost reimbursement, cost sharing, and/or fixed price. The FAA intends to invest between $300,000 and $500,000 in the first year and a minimum of $300,000 per year for the next two years of the COE. For more information on the FAA Centers of Excellence Program, contact Dr. Patricia Watts, FAA COE Program Director at patricia.watts@faa.gov. 10/21/03 Update: Questions and Answers regarding the Solicitation for the FAA Center of Excellence for Advanced Materials will be posted on the Centers of Excellence website site starting Monday, October 20, 2003.

<DESC>This amendment is to clarify requirements and extend the due date for the Statements of Capabilities (SOCs) for Eastern and Western Range Spaceports, posted to Federal Business Opportunities web page on 3 Oct 03, Reference Number 3. This requirement is similar to four Multiple Award, IDIQ contracts let in 1996 by the Air Force Research Laboratory for the Space and Missile Systems Center's Launch Test Program. These contracts were for spaceport services for potential launches from Cape Canaveral, FL; Vandenburg AFB, CA; Wallops Island, VA; and Kodiak, AK. The basic requirement centers on the providing facilities (e.g. buildings, launch pad) to support a build up of a launch vehicle (tasks which are mainly performed by a contractor providing launch services under a different contract), and the actual launch of the vehicle. The facilities must have licenses or demonstrate the ability to obtain licenses from appropriate authorities to perform launches of suborbital and orbital vehicles (e.g, from FAA.) "Eastern and Western Range", as used for this acquisition, refers to the eastern and western coasts of the United States, including Alaska. There is a possibility that the contracts will require a facility clearance or the ability to obtain a clearance, and appropriately cleared individuals, to handle classified information. Electronic submissions of Statements of Capabilities (SOCs) are acceptable, to be sent to Mr. Larry Melancon at larry.melancon@kirtland.af.mil. The due date for SOCs is extended to 3 Nov 03.

<DESC>NASA Headquarters' procurement is issuing this sources sought synopsis for meeting NASA's upcoming requirements to support the Office of Space Science (OSS) at NASA Headquarters and the NASA Management Office (NMO) in the areas of systems engineering, technical insight, technology assessment, scientific advice and programmatic support.  Businesses are requested to provide their name, location, and size and submit detailed information demonstrating their understanding of the work requirements identified below as well as their qualifications, capabilities, and experience and past performance history for such work.	 This information must be detailed because the purpose of this synopsis is to identify businesses capable of performing this work.  This synopsis is for information and planning purposes and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government nor will the Government pay for information solicited.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation.  Respondents deemed fully qualified will be considered in any resultant competitive solicitation for the requirement.  No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation.	The Office of Space Science (OSS) at NASA Headquarters is divided into three Division Offices, (Sun-Earth Connection, Solar System Exploration, and Astronomy and Physics) and two Program Offices (Mars Exploration and Project Prometheus).  The Project Prometheus and the Solar System Exploration programs Discovery and New Frontiers have identified support needs in the following areas: (1) technical insight in the areas of space nuclear power, spacecraft systems, scientific instruments, launch vehicles, optical communications and ground infrastructure; (2) Programmatic support including cost, risk, schedule and milestone assessments, financial and resource analyses, and configuration management; (3) System engineering including requirements analysis and satisfaction, evaluation of trades on cost, schedule, and performance, and management of interfaces; (4) Technology assessment including space nuclear reactors; power conversion, electric propulsion; radiation-hardened electronics, materials, instruments and telecommunications; (5) Space science program studies to provide scientific and technical advice to the OSS for special studies in areas including strategic planning, system engineering and roadmaps, mission and instrument requirements and design, engineering and cost studies, capability surveys, implementation and launch vehicle assessments, mission design, engineering trades, capability surveys and science support.  Ability to draw upon state of the art information from other government laboratories and universities is required.   Project Prometheus, Discovery Program, and New Frontiers Program are all primarily competed, and involve very large value contract awards.  Contractor must be able to conduct analyses in an independent fashion with freedom from bias that would result from predilection towards a particular hardware and/or software design or approach.  Must be qualified to provide objective technical analyses and assessments for space programs that serve the national interest.  Demonstrate ability to handle and work with competition sensitive information. The work under this requirement involves access to competition sensitive information from other companies involved in project activity in the Discovery, New Frontiers and Prometheus Programs, thus the ability to establish firewalls and other methods to prevent the leading of data to any other activity must be clearly demonstrated.  Organizational conflicts of interest agreements may apply. Interested offers having the required specialized capabilities to meet the above requirements should submit a capability statement of 20 pages or less indicating their ability to perform all aspects of the effort described herein. Note:  Contractors responding to NAIS notice 03-KMP-002 should not resubmit.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CON-TRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a defined contribution, retirement savings and investment plan, similar to a 401(k) plan, for civilian employees of the United States government and uniformed services members.  The TSP is the largest defined contribution plan in the world, with over 3.2 million participants and over $118 billion in assets as of September 30, 2003. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is an independent Federal agency charged by statute with administering the TSP. The FRTIB is exploring options for adding target asset allocation funds as an investment choice for TSP participants.  Depending on the information that is provided in response to this RFI, the FRTIB may decide to contract with a con-sulting firm to advise it concerning the establishment and operation of such funds.  If the FRTIB then decides to establish such funds, it may decide to contract with a private sector firm to manage such funds. The FRTIB is interested in obtaining information about the establishment and operation of two types of target asset allocation funds:  1. Funds that have a predefined investment objective, i.e., with target asset allocations appropriate to the particular objective that are maintained over time.  These are sometimes referred to as “lifestyle” funds.  2. Funds that have a predefined investment time horizon, i.e., with target asset allocations that will vary as the horizon date approaches.  These are sometimes referred to as "lifecycle" funds.  The terms “lifestyle funds” and “lifecycle funds”, respec-tively, will be used in this RFI to refer to these two types of target asset allocation funds.  The TSP currently has the following five investment funds, which are established by statute: The G Fund is invested in short-term nonmarketable U.S. Treasury securities that are specially issued to the TSP.  The G Fund interest rate, set monthly, equals the average of market rates of return on U.S. Treasury marketable securities outstanding with four or more years to maturity. The F Fund is an index fund that tracks the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate (LBA) bond index. The C Fund is an index fund that tracks the Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 stock index. The S Fund is an index fund that tracks the Wilshire 4500 stock index. The I Fund is an in-dex fund that tracks the EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) stock index.  These funds are described more fully in the booklets, “Summary of the Thrift Savings Plan” and “Guide to TSP Investments,” which can be downloaded from the TSP Web site, www.tsp.gov.  The F, C, S, and I Funds are currently managed by Barclays Global Investors, Inc.  The G Fund is managed in-house by FRTIB staff.  It is the FRTIB’s current intent, if feasible, to establish lifestyle or lifecycle funds using only the current TSP investment options.  In this RFI, the FRTIB is requesting information from investment management firms concerning how they manage lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds, in order to help it ad-dress the following issues:  1.  How the FRTIB should proceed in evaluating whether to establish lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds for its participants and, if so, the number and types of funds it should offer, including the advantages and disadvantages of different types of funds.  2.  Procedures for introducing lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds, including communications strategies for such funds.  3.  Methods for choosing target asset allocation percentages for lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds.  4.  The ability to use the existing TSP funds exclusively to establish and operate lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds.  5.  How lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds using the existing TSP funds exclusively could be operated using a manager other than the FRTIB staff and whether any investment management firms would be interested in such an arrangement.  6.  The potential fees and other costs associated with operating life-style and/or lifecycle funds by an outside manager, using the existing TSP investment funds exclusively.  In order to elicit the required information, the FRTIB is requesting that each responding organization provide, within 30 days of the date of this RFI, the following: 1.  Information showing that the organization meets the minimum criterion.  2.  Any information that the organization believes would help the TSP address the requests made above, including, but not limited to, answers to the following questions:  a.  For lifestyle and lifecycle funds, respectively, how many funds are typically offered by your employee benefit plan sponsors using your funds?  What are relevant trends have you observed related to such funds, such as whether plans are offering more or fewer funds, the size and types of plans offering such funds, and other similar information?  b.  How many lifestyle and lifecycle funds, respectively, do you recommend that your clients offer, and how are these funds distinguished from one another?  c.  What are the typical investments of a lifestyle fund portfolio and of a lifecycle fund portfolio that you offer? For each type of fund, how do you determine target asset allocations among these investments? Do you use specific, fixed targets or flexible “ranges” of targets?

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  IT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.  NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a defined contribution, retirement savings and investment plan, similar to a 401(k) plan, for civilian employees of the United States government and uniformed services members.  The TSP is the largest defined contribution plan in the world, with over 3.2 million participants and over $118 billion in assets as of September 30, 2003. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB) is an independent Federal agency charged by statute with administering the TSP. The FRTIB is exploring options for adding target asset allocation funds as an investment choice for TSP participants.  Depending on the information that is provided in response to this RFI, the FRTIB may decide to contract with a con-sulting firm to advise it concerning the establishment and operation of such funds.  If the FRTIB then decides to establish such funds, it may decide to contract with a private sector firm to manage such funds.  The FRTIB is interested in obtaining information about the establishment and operation of two types of target asset allocation funds: 1. Funds that have a predefined investment objective, i.e., with target asset allocations appropriate to the particular objective that are maintained over time.  These are sometimes referred to as “lifestyle” funds.  2. Funds that have a predefined investment time horizon, i.e., with target asset allocations that will vary as the horizon date ap-proaches.  These are sometimes referred to as "lifecycle" funds.  The terms “lifestyle funds” and “lifecycle funds”, respectively, will be used in this RFI to refer to these two types of target asset allocation funds.  The TSP currently has the following five investment funds, which are established by statute:  The G Fund is invested in short-term nonmarketable U.S. Treasury securities that are specially issued to the TSP.  The G Fund interest rate, set monthly, equals the average of market rates of return on U.S. Treasury marketable securities outstanding with four or more years to maturity.  The F Fund is an index fund that tracks the Lehman Brothers U.S. Aggregate (LBA) bond index.  The C Fund is an index fund that tracks the Stan-dard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 stock index.  The S Fund is an index fund that tracks the Wilshire 4500 stock index.  The I Fund is an index fund that tracks the EAFE (Europe, Australasia, Far East) stock index.  These funds are described more fully in the booklets, “Summary of the Thrift Savings Plan” and “Guide to TSP Investments,” which can be downloaded from the TSP Web site, www.tsp.gov.  The F, C, S, and I Funds are currently managed by Barclays Global Investors, Inc.  The G Fund is managed in-house by FRTIB staff.  It is the FRTIB’s current intent, if feasible, to establish lifestyle or lifecycle funds using only the current TSP investment options.  In this RFI, the FRTIB is requesting information from employee benefits consulting firms concerning lifestyle and lifecycle funds, in order to help it address the following issues:  1.  How the FRTIB should proceed in evaluating whether to establish lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds for its par-ticipants and, if so, the number and types of funds it should offer, including the advantages and disadvantages of different types of funds.  2.  Recommended procedures for introducing lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds, including communications strategies for such funds.  3.  Recommended methods for choosing target asset allocation percentages for lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds.  4.  The ability to use the existing TSP funds exclusively to establish and operate lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds.  5.  How lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds using the existing TSP funds exclusively could be operated using a manager other than the FRTIB staff and whether any investment management firms would be interested in such an arrangement.  6.  The potential fees and other costs associated with operating lifestyle and/or lifecycle funds by an outside manager, using the existing TSP investment funds exclusively.  In order to elicit the required information, the FRTIB is requesting that each responding organization provide, within 30 days of the date of this RFI, the following:  1.  Information showing that the organization meets the minimum criterion.  2.  Any information that the organization believes would help the FRTIB address the requests made above, including, but not limited to, answers to the following questions:  a.  For lifestyle and lifecycle funds, respectively, how many funds are typically offered by an employee  benefit plan that offers such funds?  What are the relevant trends related to such funds, such as whether plans are offering more or fewer funds, the size and types of plans offering such funds, and other similar information?  b.  How many lifestyle and lifecycle funds, respectively, would you recommend, and how would these funds be distinguished from one another?  c.  What are the typical investments of a lifestyle fund portfolio and of a lifecycle fund portfolio?  For each type of fund, how should target asset allocations among these investments be determined?  Could the fund be established using fixed asset allocations or would you recommend targets or flexible “ranges” of targets?  Would a manager be willing to manage a fund that did not allow such asset allocation flexibility?  With respect to lifestyle funds only, if the eligible investments of the portfo-lio vary by risk tolerance, which portfolio investments are generally included or excluded as risk tolerance increases/decreases?  With respect to lifecycle funds only, how do portfolio investment options vary as the investment horizon decreases?   We note that the TSP's active participants range in age from approximately 20 to 70.  How would this affect the num-ber or structure of lifecycle funds offered to TSP participants?  d.  Would you recommend using active or passive investments in a lifestyle or a lifecycle fund’s portfolio?  Why or why not?  e.  What are the recommended performance benchmarks for lifestyle and lifecycle funds, respectively?  How much portfolio turnover should be expected as a result of strategic asset allocation decisions?  f.  What are typical investment fee structures for lifestyle funds and lifecycle funds, respectively?  What portion of such fees is related to management of the fund’s investments in the component funds and what portion is due to investment management fees of the underlying component funds?  g.  In your opinion, could lifestyle or lifecycle funds be successfully operated using the existing TSP investment funds exclusively?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of doing so?  h.  What range of investment management fees could be expected for management of a lifestyle fund or a lifecycle fund composed exclusively of the existing TSP funds?  i.  Which firms, if any, would be willing to enter into a contract to manage a lifestyle fund or a lifecycle fund composed exclusively of the existing TSP funds?  j.  What methods are most effective in communicating the features of lifestyle funds or lifecycle funds to plan participants?  k.  What percentage of participants should we expect to participate in lifestyle funds or lifecycle funds, respectively?  For such participants, what percentage of their plan assets could we expect them to put in a lifestyle or lifecycle funds?  l.  How can we educate participants to use lifestyle funds or lifecycle funds appropriately?  What measures, if any, do you recommend to reduce market timing of these funds, or to encourage appropriate inclusion of these funds in participant portfolios?  The TSP intends to engage in further information gathering with responding organizations meeting the minimum criterion set forth in section 5, including holding meetings with representatives of such organizations to obtain further information.  The responding organization has advised at least two clients with plans having 10,000 or more participants concerning the establishment or operation of “lifestyle” or “lifecycle” funds.  INTERESTED FIRMS MUST SUBMIT RESPONSES IN ORIGINAL AND ONE COPY BY 3:30PM EST ON NOVEMBER 17, 2003. NO FAX OR EMAIL RESPONSES WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Title:  	Spectrally Tunable Solid-State Light Source

This technology provides a radiometrically stable, spectrally tunable, solid-state source.
The radiometric outputs of individually controlled, narrow bandwidth, solid-state sources 
with different spectral distributions are combined in an integrating sphere to approximate 
any desired spectral distribution.  Utilizing a sufficient number of independent solid-state 
source channels, the source can be tuned to approximate the spectral distribution of any 
desired source distribution.  A stable reference spectroradiometer that is integrated into 
the solid-state light source measures the spectral radiance and is used to adjust the output 
of the individual channels.

<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY SEEKS COLLABORATIVE R & D PARTNERS TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE AN AIRCRAFT COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEM

Announcement:  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), seeks collaborative research and development partner(s) to further develop and commercialize its aircraft collision avoidance system.

Aircraft collision avoidance is currently accomplished through either verbal coordination with air traffic controllers, radio transponders for visual indication of air traffic, active radar, and/or visual scanning on the part of pilots. Some aircraft are also equipped with transponder receivers that warn of proximity of other aircraft. Some aircraft even have internal active radar. 

LLNL has conceived an aircraft collision avoidance system utilizing GPS co-ordinates that that is a low cost, low power alternative to active radar.  LLNL’s system is able to provide equivalent data to any of the systems or technologies currently being used and gives each aircraft access to the full data at a low cost. The GPS co-ordinates of an aircraft can be transmitted at low power to a local area of a few miles. Nearby aircraft can then receive and rebroadcast these coordinates in an ad-hoc network. Each aircraft may then display the location and direction of air traffic.

An RF and GPS-based collision avoidance system can be produced at low cost. An active radar equivalent display is possible for a fraction of the cost of present systems. An aircraft avoidance system based on low power RF transmission can benefit military aircraft operations by adding safety in congested airspace.

Note:  THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.  Companies interested in developing and commercializing LLNL's aircraft collision avoidance system should provide a written statement of interest, which includes the following:
1.	Company Name and address.
2.	The name, address, and telephone number of a point of contact.
3.	A description of corporate expertise and facilities relevant to commercializing this technology.

Written responses should be directed to:

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
	Industrial Partnerships and Commercialization
	P.O. Box 808, L-795
	Livermore, CA  94551-0808
	Attention:  FBO000054-03

Please provide your written statement within thirty (30) days from the date this announcement is published to ensure consideration of your interest in developing and commercializing LLNL's aircraft collision avoidance system.
