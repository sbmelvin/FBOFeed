<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), United States Coast Guard (USCG), Telecommunication and Information System Command (TISCOM), has a requirement for underway connectivity using the Inmarsat –B leased satellite system.  The communications suite will be installed on the PC-179 class cutter to provide voice (clear and STUIII) service, fax service and data capabilities to 128Kbps.  The United States Coast Guard connectivity architecture employs pre-paid satellite leases on the 2nd generation Inmarsat satellite constellation (98W, 142W, 143.5E, 25E) along with 3rd generation (on-demand services) as an available backup to the primary lease.  Primary Inmarsat-B use is 128Kbps data operation linking the mobile unit to the shore side Land Earth Station (LES).  The LES must backhaul the mobile unit data via terrestrial path to the U.S. Coast Guard network. Variable Bandwidth Service (VBS) allows sharing of one 2nd generation satellite lease between two underway cutters providing simultaneous 24X7 64Kbps thruput to each cutter.   DHS/USCG has concluded their requirements will best be met through a custom  configuration.  The system is manufactured by Nera Telecommunications and supported only by Mackay Communications in the United States.  DHS/USCG intends to negotiate with Mackay Communications on a sole source basis.  Mackay Communications is the sole U.S. Distributor of all Nera equipment. Any contractor contemplating this requirement should know that the Inmarsat –B systems must be CN-17 compliant and operate with 2nd and 3rd generation satellites that have LES capabilities to backhaul mobile data to the U.S. Coast Guard data network.  CN-17 compliance is mandatory due to the U.S. Coast Guard purchase of United States Navy’s 2nd generation satellite leases and their associated satellite provider (LES platform).  The requirement must contain the following: 1) Inmarsat-B suite must be CN-17 complaint, 2) high speed data option up to 128Kbps and VBS capable, 3) rotary joint with installation, 4) serial printer, 5) system certification & 2-yr parts/labor warranty,  6) STU III option and 7) storage at vendors site.  Due to immediate USCG operational commitments, delivery must be on or before September 1, 2005.  It is contemplated that award shall be made utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  No telephone inquiries will be honored.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with West Virginia University, Morgantown, West Virginia, to perform a professional service contract for Automated Biomechanical and Physiological Assessment Suit (ABACAS) Project Planning and Development Support.   The expertise required to perform this work includes the ability to provide guidance regarding the preparation of project proposals and technical oversight to a team of NIOSH/HELD project engineers as they pursue the development of unique biomechanical assessment tools aimed at providing improved methods for evaluating work-place hazards involving musculoskeletal injury.  The Department of Industrial Management Systems Engineering of West Virginia University has the necessary resources to provide mentoring to our engineers on the project proposal process as well as  broad technical capabilities to assist our investigators with the technical aspects of sensor development and applying these technologies to human test subjets.  This blend of capabilities is needed to successfully develop and validate biomechanical assessment tools that can be applied to evaluate work-place exposure to potential musculoskeletal injury.  The principal investigator and administrative support research associate must work closely with NIOSH investigators and engineers as well as NIOSH/ECTB support staff currently involved in the ABACAS project in order to provide necessary technical leadership as well as research and administrative support for the development and execution of the research proposal.  NIOSH investigators will need to meet daily to weekly with the principal investigator and associated staff at the principal investigator’s laboratory in order to avail themselves of resources unique to the contractor’s laboratory which are necessary to accomplish the goals of the ABACAS project.  Thus, the principal investigator and associate staff must physically reside at the NIOSH facility on a daily basis and must  have access to our NIOSH computer services.     The principle investigator for this project needs to be an expert in advanced human factors engineering with experience in developing human factors and engineering research proposals and mentoring doctoral and masters level students in proposal development and research.  They should  possess the expertise to guide instrumentation development, convey understanding about the application of technology to human subjects, and evaluate the validity of experimental results from new applied technology related to the type of biomechanical assessment tools targeted for development under this project.  Pre-doctoral, doctoral candidate, and post-doctoral research assistance would be needed to assist the Principal Investigator.  This announcement is being issued for informational purposes only; requests for quotations are not available.    Organization that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the post date of this notice.

The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Egypt intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to implement the program described below.  The Integrated Maternal Child Health (MCH) / Family Planning (FP) / Reproductive Health (RH) Project is designed to assist the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) of the Government of Egypt (GOE) achieve sustainable reduced fertility and improved health outcomes for mother and newborns.  The Project addresses the following development challenges in Egypt’s health sector: 1) the need to further reduce fertility, increase contraceptive use and reduce unmet need for family planning, particularly in Upper Egypt, and among high-risk groups and low-parity couples; 2) the need to further reduce maternal mortality and improve maternal health services; and 3) the need to reduce the large numbers of infant deaths which occur during the neonatal and post-neonatal period. 

Four results are considered necessary to achieve the Project Objective – to reduce fertility and improve health outcomes of mothers and newborns: 1) Increased Use of Quality Integrated MCH/FP/RH Services at the Primary Health Care (PHC) Level; 2) Increased use of Quality Integrated MCH/FP/RH Services in Hospitals; 3) Positive Behavior Change in Target Communities; and 4) Improved MOHP Capacity to Sustain Performance of Integrated MCH/FP/RH Services. 

The relative emphasis of interventions will be tailored to the needs of Upper and Lower Egypt and to rural and urban poor populations.  In Upper Egypt key technical interventions include improving the quality and use of integrated MCH/FP/RH services in primary health clinics; sustaining previous improvements in hospital-based maternal and neonatal services through periodic, demand-driven technical assistance; adding FP information, counseling and services to all district hospital postpartum care and post-abortion care programs; and mobilizing communities.  In Lower Egypt technical interventions include improving the quality and use of hospital-based maternal and neonatal services; improving the quality and use of integrated MCH/FP/RH services in selected primary health facilities; and mobilizing communities. 

Behavior change activities, to be carried out in close collaboration with USAID/Egypt’s Communication for Healthy Living (CHL) Project, will include: 1) mobilizing health personnel to adopt behaviors and interpersonal communication skills that improve the quality of health care provided; 2) mobilizing individuals, families, groups and communities to use health services and to adopt healthy MCH/FP/RH behaviors; and 3) mobilizing community members, including business, to provide services and supplies to improve and maintain health facilities. 
 
To improve capacity of the MOHP, the Contractor will also provide technical assistance and training at all levels of the health system – national, governorate, district and facility levels – to sustain the high performance of priority MCH/FP/RH programs.  The Contractor will be expected to provide support for operational approaches which strengthen performance and improve management and organizational capacity in order to carry priority MCH/FP/RH programs forward without further assistance.  Where needed, the Contractor will assist the MOHP with facility upgrades, including renovation of primary health care clinics (primarily in Upper Egypt, with selected clinics in Lower Egypt) and neonatal care and hospital units essential for safe motherhood activities (primarily in Lower Egypt).

One direct contract will be awarded to carry out all activities under the main results listed above and fully bring together the two technical components of MCH and FP/RH.  Implementation under the contract will occur over five years.  The NAICS Code for this procurement is 541990. The solicitation will be posted on the FEDBIZOPPS web page (www.fedbizopps.gov) not less than two (2) months after this notice is issued.

<DESC>Prequalification for LTL/Full Truckload
Highway Transportation Services
5BSMTR-05-A-3005
Introduction and Purpose
The US Postal Service is interested in prequalifying suppliers to compete for one-way transportation routes. The contracts are for temporary routes which require tractor trailers, and or straight trucks.  Attached is a sample of the route requirements (see Attachment A).  
Delivery windows will be within two days.  Suppliers already prequalified under solicitation 204-002-03 do not need to apply for this prequalification.  Only suppliers that are either prequalified under solicitation 204-002-03 or this solicitation 5BSMTR-05-A-3005 will be allowed to compete for this service.  This solicitation is limited to asset based carriers only.
The contract opportunities will be advertised via a web-based optimization tool, therefore, prequalified suppliers must have access to the Internet.  
The Postal Service will evaluate suppliers who apply for prequalification based on the following criteria: 
Supplier Eligibility
The supplier eligibility will be determined on a pass/fail basis.  Suppliers that are on the GSA list of parties excluded from federal procurement and nonprocurement programs (http://www.epls.gov/) and the USPS list of debarred, suspended, and ineligible suppliers (http://blue.usps.gov/purchase/infrastructure/smi_pa_debar.htm) are ineligible for this procurement.  Suppliers who have defaulted on a USPS contract within the past 2 years are also excluded.  

In order to be eligible, suppliers will need to submit:
•	Tax Identification Number (copy of original form from state agency)
•	Copy of Liability Insurance Coverage (to include type and amounts of liability coverage, insurance provider, policy number, terms of coverage, and agent’s name and telephone number).
•	Operating authority (DOT #)
Financial Capability
The financial capability will be determined on a pass/fail basis.  The goal of this factor is to ensure that the supplier has the financial resources to perform the type of service described in this solicitation.  The information requested to make this determination includes:
•	An Assets & Liabilities Statement (SMTP Form 5472-PQ, see Attachment B)
•	Copies of last three months bank statements


Supplier Capability

In order to meet supplier capability, suppliers must have tractors and trailers between 24 ft and 53 ft.  Attach to this application the model, size, and year for the equipment you propose to use on USPS highway contract routes.  Indicate whether the equipment is owned or leased.  If the equipment is not yet acquired, describe the manner proposed for acquiring equipment to service awarded contracts.
Past Performance
To determine past performance the suppliers must submit a list of contracts for the past year (SMTP Form 5473A, see Attachment C) and 2 letters of recommendation from its largest customers based on dollar value of the contracts.
EVALUATION CRITERIA
The Postal Service will prequalify those suppliers who have demonstrated their ability to perform consistently to high standards of quality and reliability.  In responding to each evaluation criterion, suppliers should keep in mind that the evaluation of a response will be geared toward determining the potential offeror’s ability to perform the service sample requirements discussed in the Statement of Work and in the Terms and Conditions (see Attachment D).

Prequalification will be based on four criteria.  The criteria are shown below, listed in their relative order of importance.  That is, the first is more important than the second, the second is more important than the third, and so forth.  
1.	Supplier Eligibility 
2.	Financial Capability
3.	Supplier Capability 
4.	Past Performance  
Past Performance and Supplier Capability are of equal value and will be evaluated as:  Does Not Meet Criteria, or Meets Criteria.  Suppliers must “Meet Criteria” in all four categories to be eligible for prequalification.  If a supplier is significantly deficient in any one of these areas, that supplier will not be considered for prequalification. 
Supplier’s prequalification status will be based on the USPS policies and procedures in accordance with the IIPG (Section 3.5) http://www.usps.com/cpim/manuals/pm/pm.htm.  
The prequalification term will be from: August 1, 2005 to July 31, 2007.  Prequalification applications must be received by COB on July 22, 2005.  If you are interested, all prequalification applications or clarification can be submitted via fax to 202-268-7473 (Attention: 5BSMTR-05-A-3005), mailed to Surface Transportation CMC, Attention: 5BSMTR-05-A-3005, PO BOX 44374, Washington DC 20026-4374, or by email to Stephen.c.orloff@usps.gov.

<DESC>Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge is constructing a boardwalk and observation platform at Stillwater Point Reservoir.  The U.S. Navy Construction Battalion and Churchill County Communications are assisting with the project.  The boardwalk and platform must be constructed with pressure-treated and wood/recycled plastic composite (Trex) lumber in order to meet engineering specifications. Pressure-treated lumber must be used because the wood will be exposed to the elements, both above and below ground, and must be protected to ensure structural integrity.  Trex must be used for the decking because it's the only recycled plastic lumber that meets engineering specifications and will withstand exposure to the temperature extremes experienced in the Lahontan Valley.  No seconds are authorized.  See numbered Notes: 27.  Solicitation closes at 11:30 am on 18 July 2005.  Delivery must be on-time due to work force availability.

<RESPDATE>083005
<ARCHDATE>07122006
<CONTACT>Dennis Healy, DARPA Program Manager /MTO, Phone 000-000-0000, Fax 703-696-2206, Email dhealy@darpa.mil
<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)  is soliciting proposals for investigations of alternatives to standard analog-to-digital converter (ADC) technology implementing the usual quantized Shannon representation; i.e. uniform discretized samples at the Nyquist rate or better. Many military applications require the digitization of broadband analog signals with extreme fidelity, severely stressing current ADC technology. Shannon’s representation exploits only minimal prior knowledge about such RF environments, namely the bandwidth; consequently, standard digitization often measures much more data than is actually useful. The fundamental question of the A-to-I program is whether additional prior knowledge, hypotheses, and/or ancillary measurements can be applied to enable practical data conversion approaches which more effectively apply system resources to find the useful information content embedded in a complex RF environment and directly measure it in a more concentrated form than is possible in current practice. 

DARPA seeks innovative proposals in the following area:  Novel data conversion approaches which directly measure concentrated information in compressed format out of broad band analog environments, with consequent reductions in the digitization sample rate and/or sample density compared to classical Shannon representation, yet with no loss of fidelity for the signals of interest. Proposals should describe one year study efforts aimed at determining the minimum sampling required to characterize and reproduce with no information loss a particular signal of interest, and determine explicit mechanisms for achieving this in practice. 

Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in data conversion. Specifically excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice in RF receiver technology. 

Additional information on this technology area is provided in BAA 05-35 Proposer Information Pamphlet referenced below.

PROGRAM SCOPE
Awards for one year study efforts on Analog-to-Information technology are expected to be made toward the end of calendar year 2005. Collaborative efforts/teaming are encouraged.  A web site—http://www.davincinetbook.com/teams/Login.asp-- has been established to facilitate formation of teaming arrangements between interested parties.  Specific content, communications, networking, and team formation are the sole responsibility of the participants.  Neither DARPA nor the Department of Defense (DoD) endorses the destination web site or the information and organizations contained therein, nor does DARPA or the DoD exercise any responsibility at the destination.  This web site is provided consistent with the stated purpose of this BAA. Cost sharing is not required and is not an evaluation criterion but is encouraged where there is a reasonable probability of a potential commercial application related to the proposed research and development effort.  The technical POC for this effort is Dr. Dennis M. Healy, fax:  (703) 696-2206, dhealy@darpa.mil. 

GENERAL INFORMATION

Proposers must obtain a pamphlet entitled “BAA 05-35, Analog to Information (A-to-I), Proposer Information Pamphlet” which provides further information on program objectives and technical goals, the submission, evaluation, and funding processes, proposal formats, and other general information.  This pamphlet may be obtained from the FedBizOpps website: http://www.fedbizopps.gov/, the FedGrants website: http://www.fedgrants.gov/, World Wide Web (WWW) at URL http://www.darpa.mil/ or by fax, electronic mail, or mail request to the administrative contact address given below.  Proposals not meeting the format described in the pamphlet may not be reviewed.  Proposers must submit an original and nine (9) copies of the proposal and two (2) electronic copies (i.e., two (2) separate disks) of the full proposal [in PDF (preferred), or MS-Word readable, each on a single 3.5 inch High Density MS-DOS formatted 1.44 Megabyte (MB) diskette, a single 100 MB Iomega Zip (registered) disk, or a CD-ROM].  Each disk must be clearly labeled with BAA 05-35, offeror organization, proposal title (short title recommended), and Copy __ of 2.  The full proposal (original and designated number of hard and electronic copies) must be submitted to DARPA/MTO, 3701 North Fairfax Drive, Arlington, VA 22203-1714 (Attn.: BAA 05-35) on or before 4:00 p.m., local time, Tuesday, August 30, 2005, in order to be considered during the initial round of selections; however, proposals received after this deadline may be received and evaluated up to one year from date of posting on FedBizOpps and FedGrants.  Proposals submitted after the due date specified in the BAA may be selected contingent upon the availability of funds.  This notice, in conjunction with the BAA 05-35 Proposer Information Pamphlet, constitutes the total BAA.  No additional information is available, nor will a formal RFP or other solicitation regarding this announcement be issued. Requests for the same will be disregarded.  The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none of the proposals received and to make award without discussions.  All responsible sources capable of satisfying the Government's needs may submit a proposal which shall be considered by DARPA.  Input on technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from non-Government consultants /experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.  Non-Government technical consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled by their offerors as “Government Only”.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Minority Institutions (MIs), and Small and Small Disadvantaged Businesses are encouraged to submit proposals and join others in submitting proposals; however, no portion of this BAA will be set aside for these organizations’ participation due to the impracticality of reserving discrete or severable areas of research in novel data conversion approaches using compressed sampling of broadband analog signals with sampling rates less than the classical Shannon representation.

All administrative correspondence and questions on this solicitation, including requests for information on how to submit a proposal to this BAA, should be directed to one of the administrative addresses below; e-mail or fax is preferred.  DARPA intends to use electronic mail and fax for correspondence regarding BAA 05-35.  Proposals may not be submitted by fax or e-mail; any so sent will be disregarded.  DARPA encourages use of the WWW for retrieving the Proposer Information Pamphlet and any other related information that may subsequently be provided.

EVALUATION CRITERIA

Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a technical review of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in descending order of relative importance: (l) overall scientific and technical merit; (2) potential contribution and relevance to the DARPA mission; (3) potential relevance to realizable future data conversion technology for important application areas; (4) offeror's capabilities and related experience; and (5) cost realism. Note: cost realism will only be significant in proposals which have significantly under or over-estimated the cost to complete their effort. 

The administrative addresses for this BAA are:

Offerors who have not done business with UNICOR shall complete the ACH form, which can be found on UNICOR’s webpage.  A completed ACH form must be on file prior to contract award as well as verification of registration in the CCR database. If you have not registered in the CCR you may do so by logging onto www.ccr.gov and click on start new registration.  Offerors can obtain a copy of the ACH form by logging onto www.unicor.gov, Business Commercial Opportunities, Navigate to, Scroll down to Procurement forms, click on ACH Form, print and return completed form with written proposal.  Effective January 1, 2005, all offers are required to complete Section K, Representations and certifications by logging onto http://orca.bpn.gov as part of the proposal submission process .   You are required to key in your DUNS# and MPIN to gain access to the representations and certifications.  Your MPIN is the nine digit code containing one alpha character and one number (no special character or spaces).  The MPIN is created, by you, in your company CCR record when your CCR registration has been completed.  You can add your representations and certifications and update using this site.  It is the offerors responsibility to ensure data is up to date at all times.   ORCA is a web-based system that centralizes and standardizes the collection, storage and viewing of many of the FAR required representations and certifications previously found in solicitations. With ORCA, you now have the ability to enter and maintain your representation and certification information, at your convenience, via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  In addition, rather than receiving and reviewing paper submissions, government contracting officials can access ORCA and review your information online as a part of the proposal evaluation process. You will no longer have to submit representations and certifications completed in ORCA with each offer.   Instead, a solicitation will contain a single provision that will allow you to either certify that all of your representations and certifications in ORCA are current, complete and accurate as of the date of your signature, or list any changes. 
Although architect-engineer firms can voluntarily submit the Standard Form (SF) 330 Part II through ORCA, they still must submit this form to each agency for which it wants to be considered for projects that are not publicly announced.   To prepare for this requirement and to register in ORCA, you will need to have two items: an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR) record and a Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) identified in that CCR record. Your DUNS number and MPIN act as your companys ID and password into ORCA. (Visit www.ccr.gov for more information on creating and entering your MPIN).   The basic information provided in your CCR record is used to pre-populate a number of fields in ORCA. Vendors are reminded to protect their MPIN from unauthorized use. Once in ORCA you will be asked to review pertinent  information pre-populated from CCR, provide a point of contact, and answer a questionnaire that contains up to 26 questions. The questionnaire is to help you gather 
information you need for the clauses. The questionnaire is not the official version. Be sure to read the provisions carefully.  The answers you provide are then automatically entered into the actual FAR provisions. You are required to review your information, as inserted, in context of the full-text provisions for accuracy; acknowledge three additional read only provisions; and click a time/date stamp before final submission. You will need to review and/or update your ORCA record when necessary, but at least annually in order to maintain its active status.  Detailed information regarding ORCA, how to submit your record, and whom to call for assistance can be found on ORCAs homepage at http://orca.bpn.gov under Help.  Offers received after the exact time and date specified will not be considered.  The Government intends to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer represents the best value to the government.   The following factors shall be used to evaluate proposals: Specification, Past Performance, and Price.  Descriptive Literature: Offerors are required to submit Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) with written proposal of the product they are offering.   If your firm fails to submit MSDS with the written proposal,  your offer will not be considered for award.  A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer will be mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  The solicitation will be available on UNICOR’s website at www.unicor.gov and eps.gov on or about June 9, 2005.  No copies of the solicitation will be mailed.  All responsible offerors may submit an offer, which will be considered.

<DESC>The NATO Consultation, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) intends to advertise for International Competitive Bidding (ICB) on works and services within the framework of the NATO Security Investment Program. Eligible firms will be invited to bid for the provision of a Document Handling System (DHS) and a Document Management System (DMS) Capability for a Bi-Strategic Command Automated Information System (Bi-SC AIS). This project is included in Project 1999/5IS03028-0/9 under Capability Package (Reference (B)) to Provide ACE Static Automated Information System Core Capability. The rough cost estimate of the project is Euro 7,900,000 (USD $9.6 million).

NC3A was nominated as Host Nation for this project, which was fully authorized by the Infrastructure Committee. The reference of the Invitation for International Bid (IFIB/IFB) to be issued is IFB-CO-11678-DHS and all correspondence in relation to this procurement shall refer to this reference. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same IFIB/IFB reference.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

In the Bi-SC AIS environment, document handling is defined as the capability to efficiently store, search, and retrieve documents produced within the organization. Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE)/NATO CIS Services Agency (NCSA) Headquarters (HQ) were already authorized to initiate a Document Handling System (DHS) to satisfy their staff officers with this capability in the performance of their duties. This project intends to proliferate the SHAPE/NCSA HQ solution to the remaining Bi-SC Commands in order to support the remaining Bi-SC staff officers with the ability to input, publish, retrieve, index, and search data in the system. 

DHS data shall reside in the location where it was created, thus ensuring and maintaining document integrity, but documents shall be able to be shared across all Bi-SC users that have proper access rights. The DHS will allow users to search and retrieve documents from other commands using one or more of the following methods (in order of preference): 1) Conduct a search from their own command DHS site and 2) Portal navigation or search of the master index suite located at NCSA HQ.

To support the DHS requirement, the following main deliverables are targeted as part of this acquisition:

1. Procurement - The Contractor shall provide the required hardware and associated COTS software to implement the DHS.

2. Installation - The Contractor shall be required to install and configure the required DHS hardware and software at various locations in the Bi-SC. There are two distinct site configurations/types (large and small), which are based upon the needs of the Command/Site. The following list indicates the Commands/Sites where the DHS shall be installed and the distinct site type: 

COMMAND			LOCATION		SITE TYPE

ACO
JFC Naples		Naples, IT		Large
CC Air Izmir		Izmir, TU		Large
CC Land Madrid		Madrid, SP		Large
CC Mar Naples		Naples, IT		Large
JFC Brunssum		Brunssum, NL		Large
CC Air Ramstein		Ramstein, GE		Large
CC Land Heidelberg	Heidelberg, GE		Large
CC Mar Northwood	Northwood, UK		Large
JHQ Lisbon		Lisbon, PO		Large

ACT
HQ ACT			Norfolk, VA, US		Large
JWC			Stavanger, NO		Large
USS Mt. Whitney					Small
JFTC			Bydgoszcz, PL		Small
JALLC			Monsanto, PO		Small
NCISS			Latina, IT		Small
NATO School		Oberammergau, GE	Small
Undersea Research Ctr	La Spezia, IT		Small
NATO Def Staff College	Rome, IT		Small

NCSA
NCSA HQ			Mons, BE		Small
(enterprise/master index server)
Comm Squadron Karup	Karup, DK		Small
Comm Group Larissa	Larissa, GR		Small
Comm Squadron Verona	Verona, IT		Small

The SHAPE/NCSA HQ DRS (large site) uses standard COTS hardware servers configured to host application, web hosting, and HTML rendering services. Servers were used to build the DHS and they were all configured to use the Command Storage Area Network (SAN). The Contractor shall define the hardware specifications such that the following criteria are met:

a) Performance - NATO has identified an average 8 second performance requirement for the retrieval of any document from the site where the query is made.

b) Availability - The DHS shall provide load balancing and fail-over capabilities to ensure that a 99.9% availability metric is satisfied; thus time should include scheduled maintenance.

c) Enterprise Management System (EMS) connectivity - The Contractor shall connect the DHS hardware suite into the Bi-SC EMS for monitoring, alerting, and configuration management (hard/software).

3. Documentation - The Contractor shall deliver the DHS baseline and installation documentation. Large site configuration and installation documentation used in the SHAPE/NCSA HQ shall be provided; the contractor is free to adjust this documentation as needed. The Contractor shall develop configuration and point-and-click installation instructions for a small site. He shall verify/test all installation instructions prior to starting the first implementation. 

4. Data Migration - The Contractor shall provide data migration assistance at each Command/site. All Commands have a considerable amount of data that will be migrated to populate the DHS system. This will require a cooperative effort - the Command staff and the Contractor - to expedite the uploading. The Command will review the existing data and cleanse the file stores before migration. The Contractor will use the SHAPE/NCSA provided, or can develop their own, mass upload tool for any common data that they may have and then will assist the Command in populating the metadata in regular file stores.

5. Main Index - The Contractor shall install and configure a master index located at NCSA HQ. NCSA will host the master index for the entire Bi-SC AIS. It will allow the Bi-SC AIS NATO Secret user to query one site to find the requested data anywhere in the Bi-SC. The configuration must be able to scale to robustly support the Bi-SC AIS index growth as the capability will eventually be shared with other NATO bodies/organizations. The master index suite will also have a crawling engine that will regularly collect and update the indices from the Commands.

6. Help Desk Support - The Contractor shall provide a Help Desk throughout the DHS proliferation implementation. The Contractor shall update the Bi-SC EMS Knowledgebase and shall provide needed/requested 3rd level support to the DHS for NCSA HQ.

7. Training - The Contractor shall install the local user CBT and provide Systems Administration, Functional Administration, and Help Desk training using the SHAPE/NCSA HQ developed training suite. System administrators shall be trained to operate and maintain the DHS hardware while Help Desk staff shall be trained to support the DHS user trouble calls. Functional administrators shall be trained to assist users, maintain data, and tailor views of the operational system.

8. Produce the Concept of Operational Support Documentation - This project provides NCSA a 6 months consultancy effort to document the ACO/ACT DHS use and record adjustments to their DHS/DMS Business Process. The consultant shall also produce the Bi-SC DHS/DMS CONOPS.

ELIGIBILITY

The project has been authorized under the Two Stage Authorization Procedure, where the authorization of the first stage provides agreement on the physical scope, while the authorization of the second stage, normally to be sought by the Host Nation before contract signature at the latest, grants agreement on the financial scope and funds and provides therefore authority for signing the contract resulting from the competition. This is the first stage of the iterative development of a capability that will eventually provide a fully featured Document Management System (DMS).

Bidders will be required to declare a bid validity of 12 months from closing date for receipt of bids, supported by a Bid Guarantee of Euro 100,000 (120,000 USD). Should the selection and award procedure exceed the 12 months after Bid Closing Date, firms will be requested to voluntarily extend the validity of their bids and Bid Guarantee accordingly. Bidders may decline to do so, withdraw their bid, and excuse themselves from the bidding process without penalty.

National authorities are advised that the ICB package, including technical specifications applicable to the bidding and the contractual documents, are NATO UNCLASSIFIED. If classified material will have to be included in the ICB package or in the Bidder response to the IFB, the transmission of it shall be processed through the respective National Delegation/Mission to NATO.

The envisaged method of bidding will be the One Envelope Procedure, in which the Price Proposals are opened and evaluated and the bids ranked in order by lowest price. Technical Evaluation then commences with the lowest price bid until a fully compliant bid is found.	

Bidders will be required to quote for the provision of the subject System at 22 locations, to include hardware, software, documentation, installation, consultancy services, testing, on-site training, and transition on-site support. A three year warranty period will also be included for maintenance and support of the system. Quotations shall be on a fixed price basis for the total of the contract.

The solicitation will include a requirement for prospective bidders to document their financial ability to undertake this project and their extensive experience with the provision of similar types of systems.

The Invitation For Bid (IFB) to be issued for this acquisition is identified as IFB-CO-11678-DHS and all correspondence concerning this solicitation should reference this number.  The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using the same reference number. 

Interested firms shall be nominated by their National Authorities with the required Declaration of Eligibility. REQUESTS FOR PARTICIPATION RECEIVED DIRECTLY FROM FIRMS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED. 

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date for U.S. Embassy in Brussels to submit a Declaration of Eligibility (nomination letter) on your behalf: August 2, 2005.

2. It is anticipated that the Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be issued at end of August/September 2005.

3. The closing date for receipt of bids is scheduled for December 2005 (at least 84 days after the issue of the IFB).

CERTIFICATION

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DOES NOT SERVE AS THE CONTRACTING AGENCY FOR NATO PROJECTS.  HOWEVER, ALL FIRMS WHOSE FACILITY IS LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES MUST BE CERTIFIED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO BID FOR THIS PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center Norfolk, Contracting Department, Philadelphia Division intends to solicit on an other than full and open competition basis a requirement for McAfee IntruShield Intrusion Prevention systems consisting of:  4 ea. McAfee IntruShield 3000 sensor appliance; 4 ea. McAfee IntruShield 3000 Sensor Appliance Fail Over Model; 2 ea. McAfee IntruShield Global Manager Software; 12 months of McAfee Gold Technical Support; 2 ea. Dell 2850 servers and 48 ea. 1000B-TX mini-GB Intrfc Cnvrtr.  The procurement is being processed through other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with McAfee, Inc. and its authorized resellers for this requirement.  This procurement is to meet the U.S. Joint Forces Command’s requirement to defend the NIPRNet and SIPRNet networks.  The USJFCOM requires a nework internet protection system that can protect a host platform neutral solution with virtually any SSL-enabled server against attacks targeting the underlying Web server software via an encrypted SSL tunnel.  McAfee’s IntruShield’s network intrusion prevention system provides comprehensive network protection against both clear-text and encrypted attacks providing the capability to decrypt and inspect SSL traffic.  McAfee’s IntruShield system provides the USJFCOM with the required capability to logically segregate traffic passing through an IPS appliance and apply multiple discrete security policies for network, subnet, or even each separate host being protected by the device.  McAfee’s Intrushield system will also enable USJFCOM to retain the same equipment when its infrastructure changes from 100 MB backbone to 1 GB backbone.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement by the specified response date.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals.  However, the Government will consider information received by the specified response date.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed procurement action based upon responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information submitted in response to this notice.  The NAICS code is 423430 and the small business size standard is 500 employees.

The Government intends to evaluate offerors based on Evaluation Commercial Items with paragraph completed as follows:  N00244M313     EVALUATION OF OFFERS –USING CAPABILITY TO PERFORM AS MINIMUM CRITERIA, PAST PERFORMANCE AND PRICE FACTORS (APR 1996) (FISC SAN DIEGO) (a)  The Government plans to award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers.        (i)  CAPABILITY TO PERFORM     (ii)  PAST PERFORMANCE     (ii)  PRICE (b)  Only those Offers which are determined by the contracting officer to be technically capable of performing under Factor (i) will be further evaluated under Factors (ii) and (iii).  In the second step of evaluating those offers determined under Factor (i) to be technically acceptable, Factor (ii), PAST PERFORMANCE, is significantly less important than Factor (iii), PRICE.   At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offeror's best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   To even be evaluated as technically acceptable/unacceptable, the Offeror must furnish a technical plan and product literature that demonstrates that the offeror can meet all requirements stated in the Statement of Work.  (c) By submitting a signed proposal under this solicitation, Offeror asserts that it is technically capable of performing the specification/ statement of work and all aspects of this contract.  The contracting officer will validate offerors technical capability to perform by verifying that the offeror has financial resources, organization and facilities required to perform the contract.  TECHNICAL CAPABILITY TO PERFORM represents MINIMUM acceptable criteria.  Under this factor, offers will be determined to be either technically acceptable or unacceptable.  Failure to be determined technically acceptable under this factor will render the offer to be unacceptable and to not be considered for award.   (d)  Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE information will be used to make a determination of whether the offeror has a satisfactory record of past performance.  Offerors should, therefore, provide performance history and references to demonstrate satisfactory performance for up to three prior similar contracts performed within the past three years. See the end of this notice for a sample past performance history sheet.  PAST PERFORMANCE information should be provided on the form provided as an attachment to this solicitation.  Information utilized will be obtained from these references as well as any other sources who may have relevant information.  Offers which lack relevant past performance history will receive a neutral rating for this factor.  Any Offeror's proposal which has no relevant past performance history, while rated neutral, may not represent the most advantageous proposal to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful proposal when compared to the proposals of other offerors. The Contracting Officer will evaluate Offeror's PAST PERFORMANCE as follows: NEUTRAL:  No relevant past performance available for evaluation.  Offeror has asserted that it has no relevant directly related or similar past performance experience.  Proposal receives no merit or demerit for this factor. OUTSTANDING:   No risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of any degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon offeror's past performance. SATISFACTORY:  Very little risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, or of degradation of performance, or lack of customer satisfaction based upon the offeror's past performance. MARGINAL:  Significant potential risk anticipated with delivery of quality product, on time, and of degradation of performance based upon the offeror's past performance. All responsible Offerors are to submit current pricing, delivery time, payment terms, cage code, Dunn and Bradstreet number, Tax Identification Number and all applicable specifications regarding this solicitation.  Also required are copies of applicable commercially published price lists pertaining to your company’s services that meet the specifications, along with applicable government discounts. Initial pricing (quotes) and all technical information must be received no later than 3:00 PM (Pacific Savings Time), 18 July 2005 and will be accepted via FAX (619)-532-1088, Attn: Brian O’Donnell (619.532.3445) or e-mail brian.odonnell@navy.mil).

The Contractor Performance Data Sheet shall be completed in its entirety.  Data other than that requested on the Contractor Performance Data Sheet will not be considered.  Additionally, offerors are urged to submit brief and concise responses, within the confines of the space allotted.  Failure to submit the completed Contractor Performance Data Sheet (along with the proposal) shall be considered certification (by signature on the proposal) that the contractor has no past performance for like or similar items for the Government to evaluate. CONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE DATA SHEET NOTE:  THE INFORMATION PROVIDED MAY BE USED TO EVALUATE THE OFFEROR'S PAST PERFORMANCE IN MEETING COSTS/PRICE, TECHNICAL, AND DELIVERY OBJECTIVES.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Radiation Biology Branch (RBB) plans to procure a Resonance Magnet and gradient real time digital control system on a sole source basis with Resonance Research, 10 Cook Street, Pinehurst Business Park, Billerica, MA 01821. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 500 employees. This acquisition will be processed under FAR Part 12, Acquisition for Commercial Items and will be made pursuant to the authority in FAR 13.5 to use simplified procedures for commercial acquisitions.  Currently, NCI is actively seeking methods of measuring oxygen concentrations in tumors and normal tissue.  The Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) project is developing a technique which would allow us the ability to measure the complete oxygen map of a tumor and its surrounding normal tissue.  We have improved our techniques to a point where a new more homogeneous magnet and gradient system are required to advance our imaging achievements.   The following unique specifications are required for the magnet and gradient system in order to meet the NCI requirements:  1) three axis gradient amplifier that is capable of handling 60 Amps per channel with a rise time of 250 microseconds, 2) A real-time digital control system that can sweep the magnet at high rates which is necessary to achieve the very high scan rates and, 3) A power supply of very high stability (+/- 20 ppm/8 hours at an output of 220 Amps.  Resonance Research is the only source known to the NCI that can provide the magnet and gradient system necessary, which include (electronics: amplifiers, digital control systems, and power supply) to properly use the government owned Resonance resistive magnet and gradient coils. Hardware and software must be compatible with existing equipment. This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can perform the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other furnished information must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform this requirement.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 pm EST, on July 22, 2005.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Contract Specialist, via fax at 301-402-4513 or via electronic mail holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA). Please reference NCI-50082-NG on all correspondence.

<DESC>This is a combined/solicitation notice of intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI-5084 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 2001-25).  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) intends to procure, on a sole-source basis, using simplified acquisitions procedures, the production of 3 non-GMP grade master cell stocks of E. coli; containing plasmids, which express HIV gene products from Merck & Co., Inc. for use in NIAID Project #: 05-FR-009.  The anticipated period of performance is 08/11/05-08/10/06.  Also, NIAID will have the option to procure 3 additional master cell stocks with an anticipated period of performance of 08/11/06-08/10/07.  This product will be used as starting materials in the manufacture of DNA vaccines used in FDA-regulated human clinical trials and must be manufactured under conditions meeting US regulatory requirements for raw materials and processing conditions.  

The Contractor will utilize their proprietary process for selecting clones which are capable of yielding high levels of plasmid DNA in a batch/fed-batch fermentation process.  The Government will provide the following: A minimum of 20 ug of each plasmid; and the sequence of the gene insert of each plasmid and plasmid map for each plasmid.  The Contractor will perform the following task 3 times- once for each of the 3 different plasmids provided by the VRC.  An option will exist in FY06 for a second round of production of 3 additional cell stocks for each of 3 different VRC plasmids.  Also, the contractor will transform a high yielding E. coli cell line with a VRC provided plasmid encoding an HIV gene product.  Upon selection of a high-yielding clone using the Contractor’s selection process, the Contractor will prepare a Master Cell Stock.  The cell stock, although not required to be manufactured under GMP conditions, should be acceptable for the future generation of master/working cell banks under GMP.  Deliverables: 1. A minimum of 50 vials of master cell stock for each of the six plasmids provided by the VRC.  2. A testing report showing, at a minimum, the results of the following tests: a. Cell Stock Purity; b. Restriction enzyme analysis of plasmid DNA produced by the cell stock; and c. Any additional tests performed by the Contractor, will provide a report describing the transformation, clone selection and procedure for preparing the cell stocks or a letter authorizing the VRC to cross-reference the Contractor’s IND or BMF concerning cell selection and cell stock preparation.
 
Merck has been identified as the only responsible source for this procurement and is a leader in the field of vaccine development.  Merck possesses a proprietary screening process for the selection of high-yielding E. coli clones containing plasmids which express HIV gene products. They have successfully used this selection process to manufacture DNA plasmid vaccines against HIV which have been tested in FDA approved clinical trials. In addition, Merck has the in-house capabilities and capacity to begin work on this project immediately.  Switching to another manufacturer would result in significant time delays and additional cost to the government as new technologies would need to be developed resulting in delayed arrival of the VRC HIV DNA vaccine into the clinic.  This is not a Small-Business Set Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NIACS) Code for this acquisition is 325412 and the small-business size standard is $11.5 million dollars.  This is a firm fixed-price contract and the FOB terms are destination and Net 30.  The anticipated period of performance will be 8/11/05- 8/10/06 with an option for one additional year.    These items are to be shipped in specified quantities at the end-user’s request. FAR provisions and clauses that apply to this acquisition:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3, Contractor Terms and Conditions, Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders, Commercial Items; FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act; FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; and FAR 32.703-2, Availability of Funds.  In order to be considered for an award, an offeror must have completed the online electronic Representations and Certifications located at http://orca.bpn.gov/ in accordance with FAR 4.1201(a).

2.  CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION:   Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 3 to 5 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution. The purpose of the white paper is to preclude unwarranted effort on the part of an offeror whose proposed work is not of interest to the Government.

Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch.  In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, a fax number, and an e-mail address with their submission. All responses to this announcement must be addressed to the technical POC, as discussed in paragraph five of this section.  

3.  SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES:  It is recommended that white papers be received by the following dates to maximize the possibility of award: FY 05 should be submitted by 1 Aug 05; FY 06 by 15 Nov 05; FY 07 by 1 May 06; FY 08 by 1 May 07; FY 09 by 1 May 08; and FY 10 by 1 May 09.

V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:

1.  CRITERIA:  The following criteria, which are listed in equal order of importance,  will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit - Including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation, (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, (3) Innovativeness of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness, and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees (if any).   Also, consideration will be given to past and present performance on recent Government contracts, and the capacity and capability to achieve the objectives of this BAA. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals.  Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.  

2.  REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS:  Only Government employees will review the white papers/proposals for selection.  The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks."  These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements.  The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries.  Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.   

VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:

1.  AWARD NOTICES:  Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC.  Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract.  Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner.  Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.

All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement.  Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after proposal submission. 

2.  ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:  

Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require up to a TS/SCI facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access up to TS/SCI information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.

3.  REPORTING:   Once a proposal has been selected for award, offeror's will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS.  Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.  

VII.  AGENCY CONTACTS:

Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical points of contact, as specified below:

REQUIREMENTS:  Abt shall continue their design work for the benefit offset demonstration project and add an early intervention model.  Interested sources that believe they have the capability to perform the services required should submit a capability statement to Dawn Caracci via email at dawn.caracci@ssa.gov.  Responses shall be marked Abt - EI, CAPABILITY STATEMENT, and shall be received no later than JULY 27, 2005, 3:00PM EST.  All responsible sources will be considered.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The purpose of Amendment 2 to Solicitation No. 14350405RP43251 is as follows: 1.  To insert the Section H clause entitled "ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST" 	ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (a)	It is the policy of the Department of the Interior to avoid contract awards which could create potential conflict of interest.  Such a situation could occur in this instance when the Contractor or any Subcontractors have business, financial, real property, farming, mineral rights, or other interests, as well as professional activities that create conflicting roles which could potentially bias a Contractor's judgment or result in unfair competitive advantage to the Contractor and thus impede the Government's objective of obtaining impartial, technically sound, and objective performance of the contract. (b) Any request for waiver from the terms of this contract provision shall be directed in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a full description and justification of the required waiver. (c) The Contractor, or any of his officers or representatives, shall not involve himself in any situation during performance of this contract which may result in conflicts as contemplated in Paragraph (a) above.  Failure to comply with this provision may be cause for termination of this contract for default. (d) The Contractor must disclose any interest which may develop after contract award which may result in his placement in a conflicting role with his performance of this agreement.  Failure to comply with this provision may be cause for termination of this contract for default. (e) The Contractor shall include this clause, including this paragraph in all subcontracts and consultant agreements; however, subcontractors and consultants shall be directed to send any requests for waiver to the Contractor who shall then inform the Contracting Officer as described in (a) above. 2.  To insert the following Section I clauses: FAR 52.203-6 "RESTRICTIONS ON SUBCONTRACTOR SALES TO THE GOVERNMENT" FAR 52.237-10 "IDENTIFICATION OF UNCOMPENSATED OVERTIME" DIAPR 1452.204-70 (JUL 1996) "RELEASE OF CLAIMS"  3.  To insert the Provisions L clause entitled "CONFLICT OF INTEREST RESTRICTION" 	CONFLICT OF INTEREST RESTRICTION In order to avoid an organizational conflict of interest, or the appearance of a conflict of interest, anyone who is presently involved with loss adjustment or sales of the FCIC crop insurance programs related to this contract, or receives any funding from insurance providers who currently conduct crop loss adjustment and sales of this program, shall not be eligible to participate in the activities of this contract as a prime contractor or subcontractor. 4.  To revise Provisions L.6 entitled "INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF TECHNICAL AND COST OR PRICING PROPOSALS."  The General Instructions state that the Offeror shall submit a copy of their DCAA audited rates.  Offerors shall provide these rates, if available.   5.  To revise Provision M.2 entitled "EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AWARD."  Part 2 of the provision describes past performance.  The following sentence is hereby added: The Government reserves the right to use past performance information from sources other than those provided. 6.  Due to this amendment, the due date for the receipt of questions regarding this procurement has been extended until 4:00 PM on Wednesday, July 13, 2005. 7.  Questions and Answers The following concerns were posed in regards to this solicitation. Please note that the verbiage of the concerns may have been revised, but have not lost their significance. 1.   Q- Page 10, C.2 lists ALL Category C APH crops insured through FCIC; however, Page 11, C.3 (C.1.4) specifies crops to be targeted.  Is it correct to assume that only the following crops must be evaluated under this project: [apples, peaches, grapes, CA citrus, almonds, and blueberries] and all other crops listed on page 10 can be ignored by this evaluation (e.g. cranberries, walnuts, figs, macadamia nuts) A-All perennial Category C APH crops are to be evaluated.   However, targeted crops will probably have more detailed evaluation because of regional interview sessions, input from the specialists and specific requirements under the contract for targeted crops.  Thus, target crops will play a key role. 2.  Q-Page 11, C.1.1 states "Contractor shall analyze program experience data for 1996 through the 2004 crop years by crop and region".  Can it be assumed that in this instance, the term 'region' is intended to mean the least aggregated level of data (e.g. county)? Or does RMA desire to be presented with program experience at the 'regional' level (i.e. the area covered by each RMA regional office). A-At a minimum, it must be by crop and RMA RO region or crop region determined by the contractor.   3. Q-Page 12, C.1.5 (i) requires "recommendations for program improvements in underwriting methods and procedures used to establish ??prices". Additionally, item (j) of the same Task requires "an impact of the changes on ??prices?" Isn't the pricing methodology used to set price elections for the APH insurance program independent and unrelated to program provisions, insurability requirements, etc.?  If so, what is RMA's intent with these references to prices as they are affected by underwriting methods and procedures? A- Changes may have an impact on establishing price or delivery and must be part of the determination by the contractor for any changes recommended. 4.   Q4-1- Page 24, H.9 states that 'RMA will furnish facilities at the RMA RO's for the applicable interview sessions with RMA personnel'.  Is it correct to assume that by this statement, RMA wishes to hold the interviews with the RO's in person, rather than over the phone?    Or is this a Contractor decision to make?  Q4-2- In section C.3-Specific Tasks & Work Assignment, sub section C.1.3, it states, "The Contractor's evaluation shall include interview sessions with applicable RMA RO specialists or staff from the five RMA RO's (Davis, Raleigh, Spokane, Springfield, and Valdosta) with responsibilities for perennial Category C APH crops growing areas."  Are these interviews (1) required to be conducted in person as with the "feedback sessions" which are described in section C.3 Specific Tasks & Work Assignment, sub section C.1.4, (2) expected to be conducted via telephone or other form of electronic conferencing or (3) is this left up to the option of the Offeror in preparation of the proposal?  A- As provided in the SOW, interview sessions are to be held in the targeted RMA RO and at least two other sessions within the regions.  The offeror should outline their intentions in their proposal, which would be evaluated under technical approach. However, interview sessions in the five RMA ROs, who will provide meeting space as outlined in the SOW, would necessitate face-to-face and may require additional contact by telephone, e-mail, fax, mail or meetings as required or determined by the contractor. 5. Q- In section D-Packaging and Marking, sub section D.2, it states, "Unless otherwise directed by the Contracting Officer, if not hand-delivered by the Contractor, all reports shall be delivered by First Class mail or regulated package carrier."  Are Federal Express (Fed-Ex) and United Parcel Service (UPS) considered "regulated package carriers"?  A- Yes.   6. Q- Sections H.3-Key Personnel, L.6-Instructions for the Preparation of Technical and Cost or Pricing Proposals, Section 3.0-Capabilities Statement, and M.2-Evaluation Factor for Award, Evaluation factor 1.1-Key Personnel, discuss requirements of the Offeror in documenting the expertise of known key personnel considered to be essential to the work being performed under this contract, and various requirements of the Contractor relating to "successor" personnel.  What additional actions (if any), would be required of an Offeror or Contractor in the case where additional personnel are added to the Project Team after the initial proposal has been submitted?  A- If they are considered to be key personnel; the clause at H.3 Key Personnel would apply.  It states "The Contractor shall obtain the Contracting Officer's written approval prior to implementing any change in these key personnel assignments" 7. Q-In section L.6-Instructions for the Preparation of Technical and Cost or Pricing Proposals, General Instructions, bullet (5), what does "DCAA" stand for?  A- Defense Contract Audit Agency 8. Q- In sections L.6-Instructions for the Preparation of Technical and Cost or Pricing Proposals, Section 3.0-Capabilities Statement, and M.2-Evaluation Factor for Award, Evaluation factor 2.1-Past Performance, reference is made to "past performance references".  Based on a review of the "Past/Present Performance Questionnaire" included as Attachment 3 to the solicitation, we are uncertain if these "past performance references" are to be for Government Contracts only.    Do you want non-Government contract references as well, or is the Government sources sufficient?  A- Any sources, either non-Government or Government are sufficient. 9. Q- In section L.8-Indentification of Set-Aside, it states, "This procurement is being processed as a total set-aside for small businesses.

<SUBJECT>A -- Technology for Agile Coherent Optical Transmission Architecture (TACOTA)
<SOLNBR>BAA05-36

<DESC>This is a modification to the BAA 05-36 entitled Technology for Agile Coherent Optical Transmission Architecture (TACOTA) which was posted on April 26, 2005. You are notified that the following changes are made: Proposal due date is revised to August 26, 2005.  Areas of interest are revised as described below.  Program scope is revised as described below.

Areas of Interest
Modifications to the original BAA are made in the individual areas of interest as follows.

I. 1550 nm Coherent Optical Transmitter & Receiver Technology
This modification clarifies the definition of receiver sensitivity that is discussed in the original BAA.  Sensitivity is defined as the number of fiber-coupled 1550 nm photons per bit at the TACOTA receiver input required to achieve the desired bit error rate.  It is recommended that proposals include optical power budgets for TACOTA receivers that provide estimated optical losses referenced to fiber-coupled 1550 nm optical power in the single-mode fiber at the receiver input.  Although sensitivity is characterized by 1550 nm photons, receiver sensitivity calculations and analyses should include any effects resulting from two-way (up and down-conversion) wavelength translation.

II. Phase-Sensitive Wavelength Translation Technology
This modification is revised so that 1550 nm intra-band wavelength translation is no longer within the development scope of TACOTA.  Additionally, offerors need only address one of the remaining cited translation bands.  That is, successful offerors will develop and demonstrate one of the following two wavelength translation scenarios:

	(1) phase-sensitive translation between the 1550/500 nm bands; or
	(2) phase-sensitive translation between the 1550/3800 nm bands.

Offerors who choose to include both translation scenarios are encouraged to provide a cost breakdown that itemizes the two efforts.

III. Application-based Link Demonstration
This modification downscopes the level of effort required to test system-level TACOTA performance.  Offerors need only execute laboratory-based testing sufficient to demonstrate system-level TACOTA link performance targets, as additional more rigorous testing will take place at government laboratory facilities.  It is not imperative that TACOTA equipment be fully ruggedized; equipment should be transportable with minimal need for recalibration and be able to be easily configured and integrated with other components and/or the testbed.  TACOTA links will be tested over various ranges both with and without receive adaptive optics correction.  These links will be evaluated to determine bit error rate, sensitivity, throughput and the ability to handle atmospheric impairments.

Proposals should address transmission impairments relevant to free-space optical communications, as well as potential design paths to alleviate such effects.  Implementation of these mitigation approaches is not necessarily required as part of the TACOTA program.  In particular, transmission through either the atmosphere or through water introduces both longitudinal and transverse phase aberrations to a coherent optical communication beam.  Longitudinal phase aberrations change the overall optical phase of the beam on a timescale of hundreds of Hertz, which affects the receivers ability to both amplify and extract the information in the beam.  Transverse aberrations will change the optical phase across the wavefront, thus limiting the size of the receive aperture over which the received beam can be considered to be coherent.  Transverse aberrations have the effect of reducing the coupling efficiency into single mode fiber and dramatically increasing scintillation over that seen in incoherent free-space optical systems, which generally use multimode fiber receivers.  Both longitudinal and transverse phase aberrations are highly path-dependent and their effects should be carefully considered in developing proposal responses to the BAA. 

Program Scope
This modification specifies the length of the Program development phases.  The TACOTA program will consist of a 18 month Phase I effort with Go Ahead critical milestones at the end of 15 months.  This will be followed by a 18-month Phase II option to achieve the full performance targets.  Offerors should provide a plan to meet all the performance metrics specified in the BAA or a clear justification of why the performance metric(s) cannot be met.  These performance targets should be included in Enclosure 2 and should reflect the performance goals established in Section I.

<DESC>** Subject Synposis is hereby canceled.**

The contractor shall provide all labor, materials, equipment, and tools necessary to perform at Offutt AFB, NE and designated areas.   This effort is to seek qualified sources capable of providing support on behalf of Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) for modeling and integration work in support of The Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF) and Battlespace Environment Institute (BEI).  The ESMF collaboration is building high-performance, flexible software infrastructure to increase ease of use, performance portability, interoperability, and reuse in climate, numerical weather prediction, data assimilation, and other Earth science applications.  The ESMF defines an architecture for composing multi-component applications and includes data structures and utilities for developing model components.  ESMF is aiming to create a framework usable by individual researchers as well as major operational and research centers, and seeks to engage the community in its development.  ESMF is on schedule and will be the dominant whole-earth framework for decades to come.

DoD established the Battlespace Environments Institute (BEI) within the broad ESMF, of which, AFWA is a co-founder.  This will allow DoD to tailor access to 19 major earth system modeling components and 30 ESMF applications to meet its requirements.  The BEI will foster cross-service and cross-agency collaborations and savings, and the rapid transfer of new models to support DoD Battlespace Environments Missions. The emphasis of this requirement is to exploit existing technology, establish a close working relationship between AFWA and the earth scientists and computational experts from major U.S. Earth modeling centers, and assist AFWA in fulfilling its set of BEI obligations. More specifically, the short- and long- term space weather model development goals of a multi-year project 

Requirements include but not limited to are: 1) Establish definitions, evaluation methodologies, metrics, presentation formats, and contribution policies for a Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) high-performance computing benchmark with relevance to AFWA operational requirements and the WRF user community at large.  2) Establish a WRF parallel benchmark web presence on the maintained WRF web site, also accessible through the official BEI web site. 3) Select a WRF benchmark case, preferably a case that coincides with a theater configuration targeted for operational implementation at AFWA.  4) Establish a threshold (minimum) set of benchmarks should be generated for the following series of super computing machines: IBM P4, Cray X1 and Origin 3000.  5) Act as the technical lead and objective officiator, final arbitrator and judge for all generic and vendor-specific optimizations made to officially released WRF baseline codes by hardware and/or software engineers working for AFWA and/or BEI.  6) Establish an objective verification method to determine the effects of generic and vendor-specific optimizations on the WRF benchmark case solution(s).  7) Make available starting WRF baseline (V 2.0.3.1) and all follow-on, optimized releases to the numerical weather prediction community off of the official WRF and the BEI mirror web sites.  8) Improved WRF performances should be tracked, quantified, graphically depicted and displayed on the WRF and BEI web sites on an as needed basis.  9) Ensure that WRF can interoperate as a coupled component within ESMF, to the extent that this can be done without compromising WRF performance or functionality for other users, applications, or coupling modalities.  10) Investigate feasibility of extending or integrating ESMF coupling mechanisms and approaches with other existing mechanisms and approaches to coupling (e.g. I/O API based techniques).  11) Participate in relevant BEI meetings and other activities, traveling when necessary and appropriate.  12) Consult and provide limited technical support to BEI application groups using WRF as a coupled component within ESMF.  13) Collaborate with the AFWA BEI team on the design of the extended space weather forecast system (coupled Hakamada-Akasofu-Fry (HAF) - Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements (GAIM) GAIM and HAFv.2-GAIM within the ESMF).  13) Install and generate a proof-of-concept, retrospective run of a one-way coupled the HAF-GAIM and HAFv.2-GAIM systems (outside the bounds of the ESMF) on AFWA’s development system.  14) Work with scientists and AFWA to devise an integrated software development plan to deliver prototypes real-time, one-way coupled HAF-GAIM and HAFv.2-GAIM modeling systems that is ESMF compliant/compatible.  15) Generate and provide WRF parallel benchmarks using the latest official release of the WRF modeling system, V 2.0.3.1.  16) Generate benchmarks using a case preferable to AFWA and coincident with a theater configuration targeted for operational implementation.  17) Work with the AFWA BEI team will generate a threshold (minimum) set of benchmarks for the following series of super computing machines: IBM P4 and P5, Cray X1 and Cray XD1, and SGI Altix 3700.  Objective set of benchmarks may also include Cray XT3 results. 18) Work with scientists to establish an objective verification method to determine the effects of generic and vendor-specific optimizations on the WRF benchmark case solution(s). 

Required support is commercial; therefore, FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, shall apply to this acquisition.  The contractor shall perform in accordance with the standards outlined in the Statement of Work (SOW).  Four statements of work will be posted.  This acquisition will be solicited as a Request for Proposals (RFP) utilizing FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation.  A requirements contract will result from the solicitation.  Period of performance will be for a base period starting 01 August 2005 through 30 September 05 and five (5) one-year option periods subject to the availability of funds.  It is anticipated multiple awards will be made.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this procurement is 541710 with a size standard of not to exceed 500 employees. The solicitations will posted ON OR ABOUT 5 JULY 2005. The entire solicitation will be made available ONLY on the Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.eps.gov.  No paper copies will be issued.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package.

<DESC>This announcement is amended as follows: 1.  The anticipated release of the RFP is changed to August 2005. 2.  The point of contact is changed to Kathleen Roe, at roe.kathleen@epa.gov or 513-487-2144. The remaining text is unchanged. The U.S. EPA has a requirement for the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Certification and Compliance Division (CCD).  CCD has responsibilities under Title II of the Clean Air Act Amendments of Nov. 1990 (CAAA) which include implementing certification and compliance monitoring programs for mobile source standards and rules.   The objective of this solicitation is to provide CCD and other divisions within OTAQ with support in economic, environmental, statistical, financial, evaluative analyses, technical and engineering analyses, communication, outreach, guidance, regulatory program support, web computer system, and database support and development, and support for implementation and compliance monitoring of air pollution regulations and programmatic requirements. Such support may include cost/benefit analysis in support of regulations, support related to conducting voluntary programs and evaluating their results, summarizing and documenting public comments, review of state requirements, support analyzing, characterizing, estimating and presenting fuel economy data, support in developing and maintaining certification fee credit tracking systems, support in evaluating trends in compliance, performing systems design, development, installation, operation, administration, and business re-engineering, and providing support for outreach and communication.   Significant potential exists for conflicts of interest (COI) under this procurement.  Therefore, it is considered in the best interest of the Government to preclude from award consideration as a prime contractor or subcontractor, all motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, nonroad vehicle and nonroad engine manufacturers and fuels and/or fuel additives producers, all firms in the field of emission control/reduction, energy efficiency and/or energy technologies, as well as point source emitters of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), exhaust and evaporative hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), air toxics, and/or particulate matter (PM).  Furthermore, all offerors will be required to submit a COI plan requiring them to identify the projects they are working on and explain how potential or actual Organizational Conflicts of Interests can be either mitigated, avoided, or neutralized.  The solicitation will contain the following provision,  "Prohibition of all motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, nonroad vehicle and nonroad engine manufacturers and fuels and/or fuel additives producers, all firms in the field of emission control/reduction, energy efficiency and/or energy technologies, as well as point source emitters of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), exhaust and evaporative hydrocarbons (HC), carbon dioxide (CO2), air toxics, and/or particulate matter (PM)."  The text of this clause will be as follows: 	"The purpose of this contract is to provide support for the development, analysis, implementation and compliance monitoring of certain air quality regulations and requirements.  Whereas these regulations and requirements directly affect motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine,  nonroad vehicle and nonroad engine manufacturers,  fuel and fuel additive producers, emission control, energy efficiency and/or energy technology firms and firms that are point source emitters of NOx, SO2, HC, CO, CO2, air toxics, and/or PM, the Contracting Officer has determined that a significant potential for an actual or potential COI will result.  Therefore, any firm in an above described regulated industries will be considered ineligible for award of any contract resulting from this solicitation.  The specific determination whether any other offeror is to be considered ineligible for award will be made by the Agency on a case by case basis." The solicitation and resulting contract shall also contain the clause, "Limitation on Future Contracting."  The text of this clause will track with Limitation of Future Contracting, Alternative V (Headquarters Support), EPAAR 1552.209-74 (MAY 1994), except for paragraph (c).  Paragraph (c) of the clause shall read as follows: 	"Paragraph c:   Unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor agrees not to enter into a contract with or to represent any party, other than EPA, with respect to the specific activities performed under this contract.  Specifically, enter into contracts or represent motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine,  nonroad vehicle and nonroad engine manufacturers,  fuel and fuel additive producers, emission control, energy efficiency and/or energy technology firms and firms that are point source emitters of NOx, SO2, HC, CO, CO2, air toxics, or PM that are affected by the policy and regulations generated from this contract if the purpose is to shield or protect the company from adhering to EPA's regulations or policies.  These restrictions apply during the life of the contract." The Government anticipates award of a cost plus fixed fee term (LOE) contract with a twelve-month base term and four (4) twelve month options to extend the term.  The base level of effort for each term will consist of 14,000 direct labor hours.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRE-SOLICITATION MODIFICATION IS TO CANCEL THE NOTICE OF INTENT SYNOPSIS AND OPEN THE REQUIREMENT AS A FULL AND OPEN REQUEST FOR QUOTE. THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN FAR SUBPART 12.6, AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION. PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED. This solicitation is for FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541611-Administrative Management and General Management Consulting Services.  The solicitation number is PR-NC-05-10471, and the solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-04.   A firm, fixed-price contract is anticipated to result from the award of this solicitation. This procurement is for Roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine.  Introduction  The primary mission of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development (ORD), National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory (NHEERL) is to perform high quality, peer reviewed effects-based research to improve the Agency?s ability to make decisions about the health risks associated with exposure to environmental contaminants.   Roundtable activities are designed to be convening mechanisms for dialogue and exchange of scientific  information among individuals, including government officials, who represent all sides of particular, broad-based issues of public policy. A Roundtable on Environmental Health Sciences, Research, and Medicine would provide a structured opportunity for the exchange of information and the identification of mutual concerns among interested parties in a nonadversarial setting. Members include representatives from federal agencies, academic researchers, professional societies, associations, and private industry. The Roundtable would not provide advice or recommendations on any specific issue or policy pending before any government agency.  Background.The integral relationship between the environment and health necessitates the active participation of knowledgeable health professionals in both clinical and community contexts.  Underlying the need for enhanced education of health professionals is the need for more research--research that will further elucidate the linkages that exist between the environment and human health-- and the development of more effective preventive and therapeutic interventions. Federal agency interest and support for research in this area (primarily from National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), EPA, and  the Department of Energy (DOE)) has been growing in recent years, as the importance of integrating environmental health into health care becomes recognized as an important objective. In its broadest sense, the environment is one of the major determinants of human health and well-being.  Healthy environments promote individual and community health; unhealthy environments can create substantial morbidity, mortality, and disability, in addition to sapping the economic welfare of societies. The broad range of disease endpoints influenced by environmental exposures and the fact that these exposures can be controlled or prevented points to environmental health sciences research as one of the most promising means of improving individual and public health. This promise is rapidly being realized, in part, as a result of refinements in molecular biological techniques that enable scientists to enhance their understanding of the relationships between the environment and human health.  These techniques, combined with traditional tools of environmental health research will enable scientists to define (1) how environmental exposures affect our health, (2) how individuals differ in their susceptibility to these effects, and (3) how these susceptibilities change over time. The challenge is to develop science-based health care and policy making that integrates advances in environmental health sciences and research.  Scope of Work.  The Contractor shall convene roundtables two times a year and  twice in conjunction  with small public conferences. The conferences shall be planned in accordance with company/institutional policies. The Contractor shall limit the Roundtable membership to 35;  members shall be chosen for their professional perspective as well as their scientific credentials, and shall include:  federal researchers and policy makers, industry representatives, academics, and consumers.  The need for more in-depth and detailed discussions on specific topics is likely to emerge during the course of the Roundtable discussions.  In order to appropriately address these topics, the Contractor shall sponsor no more than two small public conferences a year on topics agreed to by the Roundtable membership. In selecting conference topics, the Contractor shall consider the timeliness of the issues, the amount of information already available on the topic, and whether or not the Roundtable can offer additional information or a breadth of perspectives that would be useful to the discussion of the topic.  In addition, the Contractor shall hold six regional Roundtable conferences. The Contractor shall provide a neutral setting for interested parties from the academic, industrial, consumer, and federal research perspectives to meet and discuss sensitive and difficult issues of mutual interest. The purpose is to exchange scientific information  and discussion across sectors and institutions, and to illuminate issues, not resolve them.  Specific agenda topics shall be determined by the Roundtable membership and shall focus on areas such as: enhancing environmental health in health care; clinical and environmental health research strategies; susceptible populations; and workforce and health professional education.  The Roundtable will not provide advice or recommendations on any specific issue or policy pending before any government agency. The contractor shall submit summary reports from each Roundtable conference.  The reports will not contain recommendations.  Product and Dissemination Plan.    The Contractor shall submit summaries of each workshop and quarterly status reports. The quarterly reports shall provide a summation of meetings and workshops held during said time period.

<CONTACT>Roxie Myers, Procurement Assistant, Phone 559 297-0706 Ext. 4831, Fax 559 294-4833, Email rjmyers@fs.fed.us
<DESC>Project Schedule: The Forest Service expects to award the design and construction contract in the fall of 2005.   The Site will be immediately available to the contractor to commence site preparation and materials staging, while the weather cooperates.   Final design work, which includes the preparation of final construction drawings and specifications, and project work and safety plans, will be accomplished from October 2005 to May 2006.  Otherwise construction is not expected to begin until the site is accessible in late May or early June 2006.    The Forest Service expects that construction will be completed in the 2006 construction season and that there will be a minimum of 3 optional years of O&M to assure the site is stable and a vegetative cover established.
	
Project Location:  The Juniper mine is located at an elevation of 8,500 feet in the Stanislaus National Forest, Summit Ranger District, about 40 miles east of Sonora, California.  

Directions: HWY 108 east of Sonora to Forest Service road 5N01, approximately 35 miles, on the right, follow signs to Niagara OHV area.  Stay on 5N01 for approximately 12 miles to the turn off for Forest Service road 5N33, the entrance gate to the Site is a few hundred yards up 5N33, which is closed to the public.  The 5N33 turn off is between Sardine and Red Rock Meadows.  Haypress Meadow, and a cluster of summer cabins, is 1 -2 miles past the turn off.

Project Description:  The Juniper Uranium Mine Site (Site) is an abandoned open pit uranium mine.   After discovery of uranium in 1955, the mine produced an estimated 500 tons of ore from 1956 to 1966.  Ore processing was not performed on site.  The main site features, including the open pit and three overburden and waste rock piles, encompass approximately 34 acres.  The estimated combined volume of the waste rock and overburden piles is approximately 50,000 cubic yards.  The Forest Service plans to consolidate the waste piles and sediments from outwash areas around the site back into the open pit in an engineered Group A mine waste repository.  Because of a spring at the bottom of the pit and seeps emanating from the pit head wall, construction of an under drain (drain rock, perforated polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping, drainage fabric, and sand layer) to prevent groundwater from flowing into the repository will be required.  Contaminated material is to be consolidated into the repository in a prescribed order, covered with a 30-mil flexible geomembrane liner, a sand drainage layer and a minimum of 3 feet of clean soil from waste pile #3.  Disturbed areas and the final cover material will be graded, blended in with natural contours and revegetated to minimize surface erosion.  Because of the partially saturated condition of waste pile # 2, which is the most significant source of waste to be place in the repository, a water treatment system will be required. The repository is expected to generate drainage that will require treatment for a brief period of time after construction.  The Forest Service expects to use an on site passive ion exchange to treat drain down from the repository.  Design specifications for treatment will be developed based on analytical results of drainage after construction is completed.  This project will require 100% performance and payment bonds.

Brief Hazard Description:   (Hazards/Environmental Impacts):  Elevated levels of uranium and gamma radiation have been detected in the area of the open pit and waste rock pile #2.  Levels of gamma radiation were highest in waste rock pile #2 (125 to 11,500 micro Rem per hour) and the mine pit (30 to 6,500 micro Rem per hour).  Uranium was detected above the 1,064 mg/kg recreational Preliminary Remediation Goal (PRG) on the surface of waste rock pile #2.  Sediments containing radio nuclides, including Uranium and it’s decay products continue to migrate offsite from the pit and waste pile #2 with spring runoff, frequent summer thunderstorms and windborne dust.   Red rock creek and the area immediately around the site are utilized by the public, wildlife and grazing cattle.  Sensitive areas immediately down gradient from the site include Red Rock and Sardine meadows.  Pre bid tour scheduled date:July 15, 2005, 10:00AM to meet at Summit Ranger District,Stanislaus National Forest, Pinecrest CA.  Estimated Government Price Range is $1,000,000 and $5,000,000

<DESC>NAICS Code: 421490   Minimum Specifications for Mobile, High Speed Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) Spectrometer Amendment #2:  FT-IR Spectrometer Technical Questions & Answers.  The original response date of 07/22/05 remains unchanged. Could you please define "high speed" ? Answer:    An FT-IR spectrometer must have high throughput capability, allowing for over 200 scans per second.  The telescope emits radiation so any black body calibration source needs to be in front of the telescope.  We recommend a seperate high accuracy black body following the design principles of  NIST. Answer:  The unit we are asking for has to be compact and portable, and is designed to be located in helicopters or fixed wing aircraft.  For this reason the blackbody used for instrument calibration is placed internally between the inferometer and telescope.  Additionally, the EPA completes  a one time calibration of the telescope before data collection to address any issues regarding radiation from the telescope.  This is a combined synopsis/request for quote for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional  information included in this notice.  Quotes are being requested and a written RFQ will not be issued.  Shipping charges need to be included in price.  The current NAICS code is 423490 for this requirement. (the previous NAICS code from 1997 was 421490, which is also listed in the synopsis).  The  specifications for the Mobile, High Speed Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FT-IR) Spectrometer are as follows:   Background: One of the primary missions of the Landscape Characterization Branch (LCB) of the National Exposure Research Laboratory's Environmental Science Division (NERL-ESD) is the  research in advanced remote sensing technologies for environmental monitoring and characterization. NERL-ESD has a role to test and validate these technologies against a variety of applications, including: o	Biomass burning emission characterization and chemical speciation. o	Characterize  emissions from industrial chemical plants and CAFOs in support of regional clients such as Air Permitting and Planning divisions. o	Research in emission fluxes from CAFO, municipal landfills, and waste treatment facilities. o	Validation of data obtained by earth observing remote sensing satellites,  such as the NASA EOS systems. o	Homeland security related events including: o	emergency response to accidental releases or a terrorist release of chemical or biological agent - the library of chemical candidates includes all known chemical and biological agents.  Sampling of gaseous emissions is a  difficult task that is often dangerous to implement and the results uncertain due to the sampling instruments and protocols involved. Emission sources are often in hazardous areas and are hard to access for sampling or sensor placement. Emergency responses to chemical releases require real-time  analysis and reporting, which is often not achievable using direct sampling techniques. Stand-off sensing technologies allow for remote sensing of chemical emissions from distances up to 1km and beyond in some cases. Recent advances in sensor technologies including miniaturization have produced  very accurate systems that can discriminate thousands of chemical species in real time without active illumination sources or specialized reflectors. These systems are relatively easy to use and are very portable, requiring only small amounts of liquid nitrogen for cooling. The system proposed on  this request can be configured to collect data from airborne platforms such as helicopter, or on the ground using a telescope lens. Minimum Specifications: The requirements for this order consist of the design and development of a  fast-scanning and portable FT-IR spectrometer system. The system  is required to be a highly portable FT-IR spectrometer capable of calibrated absolute emissivity measurements, and is proven in rugged geophysical and remote sensing applications. The system shall consist of a small compact packaging, rugged and reliable performance, and low power consumption. This  mobile, high speed FT-IR spectrometer has to be capable of deployment on fixed wing aircraft, or a helicopter platform.  The contractor will need to provide a proven design and be able to demonstrate successful remote detection of chemical plume species under a variety of environments. 1.    Computer and Sensor: The spectrometer shall be integrated with a computer for system control and data analysis. The computer shall be capable of running all spectrometer control functions as well as being able to performing data analysis operations. The integrated computer shall enable housing of  the A/D board within the unit and provide a ready-to-go portable workstation, including the keyboard and display. The entire system shall be able to run on standard wall power and also use a 12 volts supply and inverter adequate for the power consumption requirements. 2.  Detector: The detector  shall be a single pixel LN2 cooled two-color InSb/MCT detector. 3.  Blackbody Calibrator:  An on-board warm/cold blackbody will be incorporated into the system, to enable on-the-fly calibration of the instrument.  This blackbody shall be between the interferometer and the outward looking  telescope. 4.   Fore-Optics and Sighting: The system shall have a 4" diameter Cassegrain type telescope which shall provide a 1.2? field of view (FOV). At a standoff distance of one kilometer this shall be able to provide targeting of an area approximately 21 meters in diameter. The telescope  shall include, through-the-lens viewing for boresighting. 5.  Software:  The following levels described shall also be provided in this deliverable: Level 1:  Acquire Sample and Reference Data and Subtract or Ratio. This shall give a raw spectrum of the species of interest with the background  removed.  If the Radiance was not used for the Sample and Reference data before the background removal, the software shall have the ability to use the blackbody to measure the instrument transfer function and to produce radiance measurements. Level 2:  Correlation of Level 1 Measured Spectrum with  a Known "Target" Spectrum.  A calibration of the instrument transfer function is needed for target species with broad peaks or with multiple peaks in order to derive radiance values. Spectral detection algorithms are performed on Radiance rather than on raw intensity data. The software shall  possess a technique to correlate these with the use of internal blackbodies measurements to an external blackbody. Orthogonal Subspace Projection (OSP) will be used to remove from 3 - 6 backgrounds from a sample scan. OSP addresses the issue of "known" backgrounds.  The OSP algorithm shall allow  for the specification of several backgrounds at once. All items shall be delivered to the U.S. EPA, 109 TW Alexander Dr., RTP, NC 2771 no later than 120 days after award.  FOB point shall be destination.  The following clauses apply to this request for quote:  FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to  Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items, and the specific evaluation criteria is as follows: (1) Technical acceptability of the item offered to meet the Government's requirement and (2) Technical acceptability shall be evaluated on a pass or fail basis.  Offers shall  provide descriptive technical literature in sufficient detail to demonstrate that the items offered meet the minimum requirements specified above;  FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations & Certifications- Commercial Items, shall be completed by offeror and submitted with quote, unless the offeror's  registered with CCR; FAR 52.212-4, Contract terms & Conditions- Commercial Items;  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms & Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items.

(a)  General: 
(1) Performance of this contract may require deployment of Contractor Personnel in support of military operations.  The Contractor acknowledges that such operations are inherently dangerous and accepts the risks associated with contract performance in this environment.
(2) For purposes of this clause, the term “Contractor Personnel” refers to the Contractor’s officers and employees.  Unless otherwise specified (e.g., subparagraph (b) of this clause), this term does not include personnel who permanently reside in the country where contract performance will take place.
(3) The Contractor shall ensure that Contractor Personnel working in an area of operations (AO, as defined in the Joint Publication 1-02, DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms) are familiar and comply with applicable:
(i) Military Service and Department of Defense regulations, directives, instructions, general orders, policies, and procedures, in particular Army Regulation 715-9 and Field Manual 3-100.21; 
(ii) U.S., host country, local, and international laws and regulations; and 
(iii) treaties and international agreements (e.g., Status of Forces Agreements, Host Nation Support Agreements, and Defense Technical Agreements) relating to safety, health, force protection, and operations under this contract.
(4) The Contractor shall ensure that this clause is included in all subcontracts.
(b) Compliance with Combatant Command Orders. The Contractor shall ensure that Contractor Personnel, regardless of residency status, working in the AO comply with all orders, directives, and instructions of the combatant command relating to non-interference in military operations, force protection, health, and safety.  The Combatant Commander or his subordinate commanders, in conjunction with the Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer’s Representative, may direct the Contractor, at the Contractor’s own expense, to replace and, where applicable, repatriate any Contractor personnel who fail to comply with this provision.  Such action may be taken at the Government’s discretion without prejudice to its rights under any other provision of this contract, including the Termination for Default clause.
(c) Contractor Personnel Administration.
(1) In order to maintain accountability of all deployed personnel in the AO, the Contractor shall follow instructions issued by the Army Materiel Command’s Logistics Support Element (AMC LSE) or other Contracting Officer’s designated representative to provide, and keep current, requested data on Contractor Personnel for entry into military personnel database systems.
(2) The Contractor shall coordinate with the AMC LSE or other Contracting Officer’s designated representative for logistics support, as follows:
(i) upon initial entry into the AO; 
(ii) upon initiation of contract performance; 
(iii) upon relocation of contract operations within the AO; and (iv) upon exiting the AO.
(3) Before deployment, the Contractor shall ensure that:
(i) All Contractor Personnel complete two DD Forms 93, Record of Emergency Data Card.  One copy of the completed form shall be returned to the Government official specified by the Contracting Officer’s designated representative; the other shall be hand-carried by the individual employee to the AO.
(ii)     All required security and background checks are completed.
(iii)     All medical screening and requirements are met.
(4) The Contractor shall ensure that Contractor Personnel have completed all pre-deployment requirements specified by the Contracting Officer’s designated representative (including processing through the designated Continental United States (CONUS) Replacement Center unless another deployment processing method is specifically authorized), and the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer’s designated representative that these actions have been accomplished.
(5)     The Contractor shall have a plan for timely replacement of employees who are no longer available for deployment for any reason, including mobilization as members of the Reserve, injury, or death.
(d) Clothing and Equipment Issue.
(1) To help distinguish them from combatants, Contractor Personnel shall not wear military clothing unless specifically authorized by a written Department of Army waiver.  Contractor Personnel may wear specific items of clothing and equipment required for safety and security such as ballistic or NBC (Nuclear, Biological, Chemical) protective clothing.  The CONUS Replacement Center or the combatant command may provide to the Contractor Personnel military unique Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE) to ensure security and safety.
(2) All issued OCIE shall be considered Government Furnished Property, and will be treated in accordance with Government Furnished Property clauses included elsewhere in this contract.  The contractor shall ensure that all issued OCIE is returned to the point of issue.
(e) Weapons and Training.
(1) Contractor Personnel may not possess privately owned firearms in the AO.  The combatant command may issue weapons and ammunition to Contractor Personnel, with the employee’s company’s consent as well as the individual employee’s consent, and may require weapons and other pre-deployment training.
(2) The Contractor shall ensure that Contractor Personnel follow all instructions by the combatant command, as well as applicable Military Service and DoD regulations, regarding possession, use, safety, and accountability of weapons and ammunition.
(3) All issued weapons, ammunition, and accessories (e.g., holsters) shall be considered Government Furnished Property.  Upon redeployment or notification by the combatant command, the Contractor shall ensure that all Government issued weapons and unused ammunition are returned to the point of issue using a method that complies with Military Service regulations for issue and turn-in of firearms.
(f) Vehicle and Equipment Operation.
(1) The Contractor shall ensure that Contractor Personnel possess the required licenses to operate all vehicles or equipment necessary to perform the contract in the AO.
(2) Contractor-owned or leased motor vehicles or equipment shall meet all requirements established by the combatant command and shall be maintained in a safe operating condition.
(g) Passports, Visas and Customs.  The Contractor is responsible for obtaining all passports, visas, and other documents necessary for Contractor Personnel to enter and exit any AO.
(h)     Purchasing Limited Resources. When the Combatant Command establishes a Commander-in-Chief Logistics Procurement Support Board (CLPSB), Joint Acquisition Review Board, or similar purchase review committee, the contractor will be required to coordinate local purchases of goods and services designated as limited, in accordance with instructions provided by the Administrative Contracting Officer or the Contracting Officer’s designated representative.

<CONTACT>Steven Jones, Contracting Officer, 202-287-1474, steven.jones@hq.doe.gov;Barry Page, Contract Specialist, 202-287-1506, barry.page@hq.doe.gov
<DESC>SUMMARY: On Jan. 12, 2004, the U.S. Secretary of Energy, the China Ministry of Science and Technology and the City of Beijing entered into a protocol to collaborate on the use of clean energy technologies in the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, entitled â€œProtocol for Cooperation in Clean Energy Technologies for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijingâ€ (see https://ostiweb.osti.gov/iaem/country-frame_bi.html).  Several joint working groups were created to implement the protocol, including a Green Building Working Group (GBWG) focused on the use of sustainable technologies and practices in the Olympic Village. The designers and developers of the Olympic Village have expressed strong interest in producing a model development that will be among the first in the world to achieve a Gold Rating under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design â€“ New Design (LEED-ND), a new rating system being created by the U.S. Green Building Council and others to facilitate the development of sustainable communities. Working with the designers and developers of the Olympic Village, the GBWG has identified a number of opportunities for the private sector, non-government organizations and academic institutions to help the Olympic Village achieve this goal. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) believes that an integrated technology, services and know-how package can be assembled that would significantly enhance the Olympic Villageâ€™s ability to achieve a LEED-ND rating in six key areas: 1. Site Planning; 2. Water Conservation Products and Processes; 3. Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Technologies and Practices; 4. Indoor Air Quality Management Technologies and Products; 5. Material Recycling and Solid Waste Management Systems; 6. Innovative Professional Education and Training Initiatives. The U.S. DOE now intends to work with the private sector, non-government organizations and academic institutions to form a comprehensive technology, services and know-how package for submission to the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Games of the XXXIX Olympiad (BOCOG) responsible for the Olympic Village. This package will include offers of products, services, technical assistance, consultation, education and training. The U.S. DOE anticipates that this package may provide an opportunity for participating U.S. companies, non-government organizations and academic institutions to demonstrate their products and services in the China market and to develop relationships that will be beneficial beyond the 2008 Olympic Games. The U.S. DOE invites expressions of interest from the private sector, non-government organizations, and academic institutions wishing to participate in the development of this package. The Chinese members of the GBWG are interested in product and service donations, price discounts and other concessions that will help make US products and services competitive with offers from other nations.  Once a comprehensive package is developed and submitted to the Chinese GBWG, the selection process will take place. Products: 1. CHP system for National Convention Center 2. High-efficiency chillers for wastewater heat pump system 3. High-efficiency windows for residential high-rises 4. High-efficiency lighting fixtures, including T-8 fluorescents with electronic ballasts           inunderground garage 5. Recycled/recyclable carpeting 6. PV-powered outdoor lighting fixtures 7. Building-integrated photovoltaics 8. Shading devices to optimize passive solar performance 9. Ventilation and daylighting systems for underground garage 10. Noise mitigation technology/procedures to reduce traffic noise adjacent to village 11. Water-saving toilets, urinals and fixtures 12. High-efficiency pump and motor systems throughout the development (i.e., in wastewater           heat pump system, mechanical ventilation of underground garages, rainwater           consumption system, constructed wetland, etc.) 13. Modular chillers to be removed after Games. 14. Automatic lighting controls for underground garage 15. LED signage within buildings 16. Wind turbines/towers for Mongolia wind farm 17. Hybrid ventilation equipment for underground garage 18. Alternative water-heating equipment (solar thermal, tankless heaters) 19. Concrete recycling 20. Municipal solid waste combustion technology 21. Bio-foam building insulation 22. Low VOC paints 23. Low VOC sealants/solvents/adhesives 24. Low VOC carpet 25. Radiant heating/fan coil cooling units 26. Rooftop gardening liners/materials 27. Water-conserving landscape irrigation equipment 28. Permeable road surface materials Development projects: 1. Construction/demolition of temporary buildings on Olympic Village site, with greater           than 80% recyclability 2. Construction of engineered wetlands in Village 3. Rainwater collection, storage and distribution system 4. Construction of traffic noise mitigation system 5. Design and construction of a zero-energy building within the Olympic Village (a building           that produces as much or more energy than it consumes.) Analyses: 1. Improving the efficiency of the entire wastewater heat pump system. 2. Optimizing energy efficiency of residential buildings, including passive solar           performance. 3. Assessing life-cycle cost of CHP system at National Convention Center 4. Conducting a whole-building simulation of at least one residential high-rise 5. Evaluating optimal motor and pump system sizing appropriate to tasks 6. Recommending optimal hot water temperature to maximize efficiency of the chillers and           overall wastewater heat pump system 7. Quantifying the impact of using direct wastewater versus indirect wastewater on cost and           efficiency of chillers in wastewater heat pump system Other services: 1. Commissioning of residential high-rise buildings and systems 2. Designing communications/interpretation materials to educate media, public and           potential buyers about green features and their benefits 3.

<DESC>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) intends on issuing a Purchase Order, utilizing Simplified Acquisition/Commercial Items/Sole Source procedures to Group 1 Software, Lanham, MD for the purpose of purchasing a COTS Address Correction, Geocoding & Spatial Client Server software package FOB Destination to Bluemont, VA.  The software package consists of:  

A) Address Standardization and Correction: Product must accept US street addresses and standardize the address to meet USPS requirements. For example Street maps to ST, Avenue to AVE, Northwest to NW. Product must add zip+4 to standardized address, and correct the address when possible to add missing address information. Product must be able use conflated datasets, which provides the ability to geocode locations that may not exist in USPS data set. Examples are locations such as gated communities, general delivery areas, and other miscellaneous areas not eligible for US Postal delivery. Products must be able to be run in batch, real time- interactive, and web applications. 
B) Geocoding: Product must accept a standardized and corrected address and geocode the address to the specific location, determining the latitude and longitude of the physical address (not the zip+4 center point). Address level geocoding. 
C) Spatial Component: Product must accept a latitude/longitude coordinate and provide a PIP (Point In Polygon) capability to determine whether the given coordinate is within a given polygon defined by a map. The product must provide the ability for maps to be defined as polygons to support that lookup. The product must be able to determine the distance from the lat/long to the nearest border of the map so a 'confidence level' can be determined. Product must be able to create buffer zones, which can then utilize with confidence codes to help determine if the locations will need further validation to information to determine if the address is in/out of a hazard/flood plan area. The product must be able to identify the number of address within a certain area, i.e. hurricane tracks......
D) The product to meet the following technical requirements:
a) The product must have an Application Programming Interface (API) available for integration with C++ or Java programs.
b) The product must support the requirement to load various maps and associated data sets for PIP needs. Specifically, the ability to locate a given lat/long point in relation to Flood Plain Maps is required. Since various Flood Plain Maps are available on the market, the product must be able to operate with 3rd party Flood Plain Maps.
c) Ability to append additional data to an address
d) Additional tech requirement: products must support conflated data sets which combine the benefits of USPS data sets and commercially available data sets from Navteq, GDT-Teleatlas, etc.
e) Spatial Component- products must be able to do multiple spatial comparisons in a single system "call" 
f) Unlimited user licensees for use in an Enterprise server wide environment.

Potential Offerors having objections to non-Government personnel participating in the evaluation of proposals and/or contract documentation including resultant contract administration activities shall contact the PCO prior to submitting their proposals.  

J.	BASIS FOR AWARD:  Contract award decisions, if any, will be based on an evaluation of which proposals or parts of proposals best further the Government objectives in the GPS OCX PRDA effort and on the availability of funding.  The Government intends to make multiple awards with one small business set-aside.  The selection of none, one, or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each Offeror’s proposal (both technical and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the GPS OCX PRDA.  Proposals are evaluated solely on the criteria published in this PRDA.  The proposals will be evaluated based on the following two criteria that are listed in descending order of importance.  No other evaluation criteria will be used.  Each criterion will be evaluated concurrently.


CRITERIA I

Mission Capability
The Offeror’s proposal will be evaluated separately for both technical content and program management on how well the proposal will achieve the overall PRDA objectives.  The evaluation will focus on the understanding demonstrated and the effectiveness of the Offeror’s proposed solution for:

a.	Offeror’s understanding of the technical scope and approach in accomplishing the objectives of the SOO and execution of the CSOW
b.	Degree of innovation displayed (balanced by lessons learned, best practices, and proven technologies)
c.	Management approach to accomplish the objectives of the SOO and execution of the CSOW
d.	Approved subcontracting goals (as applicable)

CRITERIA II

Cost/Price: Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Although an important discriminator, Mission Capability is significantly more important than Cost/Price.  The Offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable and realistic.

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated concurrently.

The Evaluation Teams will produce and document findings that thoroughly identify and describe strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies associated with each Offeror’s proposal when evaluated against each evaluation criteria.  Any information or data incorporated by reference or referral will not be considered.

Mission Capability Technical Merit ratings will be rated: Outstanding – a significant or exceptional aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has merit and exceeds expectations in a way beneficial to the Air Force and will be included in the contract or inherent in an Offeror’s process; Good – meets expectations; Marginal – aspect of or omission from proposal that may contribute to a failure in meeting specified minimum objectives; Unacceptable – materiel failure to meet objectives; or Unique – may not meet all Air Force objectives but offers a unique innovation that justifies special consideration.  Mission Capability  Program Management will be rated Acceptable – Yes or No. Cost/Price rating will be Reasonableness (“Yes” or “No”) and Realism (“Yes” or “No”).

K.	DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: The delivery address for proposals is: SMC/GPK (Attn: Carol Laechelt), Los Angeles Air Force Base, 2400 South Pacific Avenue, Building 410, Fort MacArthur, San Pedro CA 90731.  Personal delivery of proposals or delivery other than on 20 June 2005 shall be coordinated 24 hours in advance of the proposed due date/time with the PCO to ensure timely submission.

Offerors shall pre-coordinate delivery time with either the PRDA PCO (Carol Laechelt) or the PRDA Deputy Program Manager (Capt Grant Leeds).

L.	AWARD NOTIFICATION: The PCO will notify Offerors whose proposals have not been selected for negotiation/award as soon as possible.  When a proposal is not selected for award, an Offeror may submit a written request for pre-award debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505(a).  Any post-award debriefing of Offerors shall be accomplished in accordance with FAR 15.506.

M.

<DESC>Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL), a nuclear fusion research facility operated by Princeton University under contract to the United States Department of Energy, is seeking expressions of interest from firms and organizations qualified and experienced in the conduct of oral history interviews. This is a Request for Information (RFI) announcement, not a solicitation. After consideration of response information, comments, and capabilities, a solicitation may be issued at a later date.  Interviews will be conducted with four internationally-recognized plasma physicists to document their life-long involvement with -- and contributions to -- controlled thermonuclear fusion research. Three of the interviewees reside in California, and the other resides in the United Kingdom. At least one trip to each of the interviewee’s locations will be required. Both the interviewer and interviewee will be required to sign over copyright in and to the interview to Princeton University. The individual being interviewed will have an opportunity to restrict access to specific sections or to the full transcript for a finite period of time to protect the privacy of living individuals. A restriction statement will be written into the copyright agreement signed by both the interviewer and interviewee before interviews commence. The agreement will also include a statement allowing the interview to be posted on the internet at some time in the future when restrictions have lapsed. The interviews will be audio taped, transcribed by a professional transcriber, and edited by both the interviewer and interviewee for accuracy. The edited transcript will be placed on the Department of Energy Web site. The original tapes of the interview will reside at archives at Princeton University.  Interviews will focus on the individual’s work in the fusion research area. The Interviewer will prepare questions to guide and structure the interviews. Interviewers should be historians with a doctorate in the history of science and history of physics with oral history interview experience. Offerors will include interviewer(s) names and qualifications in their proposals, and the selected contractor shall not substitute proposed individuals without the express approval of PPPL. The interviewer(s) will conduct preparatory research prior conducting the interviews.  This project will result in two products for each individual interviewed: digital audio recordings of interviews, and edited transcripts of the interviews in both digital form and hard copy. Source selection criteria will, at a minimum, include: (1) Experience and education of proposed interviewer; (2) Prior experience of organization supporting interviewer; (3) Proposed time schedule to complete the interviews; and (4) Price. All interested and capable parties are invited to submit capability statements, budgetary cost information, and comments in relation to this RFI. This information should be submitted via electronic copy to Ms. Arlene White, Senior Buyer, PPPL, at awhite@pppl.gov. All phone inquiries should be directed to Ms. White at 609-243-2080.

<SUBJECT>89 -- Notice of Our Valued Suppliers
<DESC>MEMORANDUM FOR DSCP SUBSISTENCE PRODUCE VENDORS

To Our Valued Business Partners:  

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your continued support of our war fighters.  During these times, it is important that the level of support remain high, while remaining aware of the ever-changing world events which can cause disruption to customer support.  We here at the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), as well as our customers and their respective Headquarters personnel, appreciate all you have done, and will continue to do, to support our war fighters.

The DSCP is a leader in providing its customers with cost savings, and quality product, and is always striving to continue to improve its way of doing business.  To continue to improve DSCP’s service to its customers, the Produce Acquisition Branch is initiating a new business initiative.  In lieu of issuing weekly buys to support troop, DeCA Commissaries or School Lunch Programs, DSCP will be entering into long term Indefinite Quantity Contracts (IQC’s).  An IQC contract will be awarded to a full line produce provider to delivery an entire catalog of items to one or more customers exclusively.  The IQC contract will greatly reduce the amount of paperwork that is handled by DSCP and its customers.  The new business practice will also reduce cost for the customer.  There are some areas within the DSCP Produce network that already operate under this new business practice, others are just beginning.  DSCP Produce plans to have customers throughout the continental United States under long-term contracts within the next 12-18 months.  

In addition to supporting the customer through the use of IQC contracts, DSCP Produce intends to utilize an electronic ordering system.  In an effort to streamline our ordering and receipt process, future contracts will require vendors to be able to accept, acknowledge and receipt orders through Electronic Data Interchange (EDI).  Therefore, to continue to provide produce to our customers, vendors must be EDI compliant within the next 18 months.  

The system currently used by DSCP Customers is Subsistence Total Ordering and Receipt Electronic System (STORES).  STORES will electronically submit a customer’s order directly to the contracted vendor.  It also automatically sets up the invoice process that is completed when the customer acknowledges receipt at time of delivery.

The EDI Guidelines for Implementation to can be found at the DIBBS website (https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil/) under Notices (at bottom of page).  This document outlines the points of contact and EDI transaction sets that you as a vendor will be responsible for implementing.  Although a timeframe has yet to be developed for full implementation, the sooner your company is EDI capable the better equipped it will be to assist in providing the customers with improved services.  

If your company is able to exchange information electronically through ANSI X12 format, we could set your company up as an EDI vendor immediately, being able to receive orders and send invoices electronically.  The transaction set for an order is an 850, while the transaction set for an Invoice is an 810.  It is highly recommend that you utilize these transactions sets in unison to provide a seamless order and payment process.  While this is a business decision for your firm, there are companies available for a fee that will turn your flat files into EDI Invoices (810 transactions).

To reiterate, all produce vendors must be EDI compliant within the next 18 months to continue providing product to our customers.  If you have any questions, concerns or need assistance, please contact Frank Holder, frank.holder@dla.mil, 215-737-3311; Joanne Bonese, Joanne.bonese@dla.mil, 215-737-2913 or Dawn Leason, dawn.leason@dla.mil, 215-737-4364.

<SUBJECT>M -- Air Force Space Command, Uni-Comm project, consolidation of O&M  of core enterprise comm and IT services command-wide.
<DESC>Air Force Space Command - Uni-Comm-Notice-1.

12 July 2005.


1.  The Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Uni-Comm project is an initiative to consolidate management of operations and maintenance of core enterprise communications and information technology (IT) capabilities and services command-wide, thereby improving the efficiency of essential AFSPC communications and IT services to the space combat warfighter.  The AFSPC Uni-Comm project will also seek economic and operational efficiencies through consolidation of services where appropriate.  The project supports the policies and guidance of the Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Commander of Air Force Space Command.  Overall objectives of the AFSPC Uni-Comm project include the following:

  *  Establish and manage AFSPC-wide network operations and maintenance core services under contract.

  *  Support a Major Command (MAJCOM) management capability to operate, protect, and defend the AFSPC enterprise network.

  *  Provide all AFSPC-owned installations (except some locations as noted) standardized core communication services with the ability to exceed standard service levels as missions warrant.

  *  Provide management and cost efficiencies at the earliest opportunity and over the life of the project.

  *  Support the single Designated Approval Authority (DAA) concept (for certification of network systems for meeting information assurance requirements).

2.  The AFSPC Uni-Comm project is expected to eliminate the management and cost inefficiencies inherent in operating multiple contracts at multiple sites.  Existing core communications and IT services are expected to include data (NIPRNET – Non-Secure Internet Protocol Network – and SIPRNET – Secure Internet Protocol Network), voice (unclassified/admin phone, DRSN – Defense Red Switch Network, a secure voice network), Land Mobile Radio (LMR) and Video Teleconference (VTC).  It is expected the following main operating base (MOB) locations will transition to Uni-Comm (Note: some Geographically Separated Units (GSUs) that do not have host-base or host nation support are also expected to transition to Uni-Comm):

  *  F.E.Warren Air Force Base (AFB), WY (20 Air Force [AF], 90 Space Wing [SW]).

  *  Los Angeles AFB, CA (Space and Missile Center [SMC]).

  *  Malmstrom AFB, MT (341 SW).

  *  Patrick AFB, FL (45 SW).

  *  Peterson AFB, CO (21 SW and some GSUs):
          - 6th Space Warning Squadron - Cape Cod AFS.
          - 13th Space Warning Squadron - Clear AFS Alaska.
          - Det 3, 18th Space Surveillance Squadron - Maui, Hawaii.

  *  Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station (AFS), CO.

  *  Schriever AFB, CO (50 SW and some GSUs):
          - Onizuka AFS, CA (21 Space Operations Squadron [SOPS]).
          - 22 SOPS Det 1 Vandenberg AFB, CA.
          - 22 SOPS Det 4 Oahu Hawaii.
          - 23 SOPS, New Boston AFS, NH.

  *  Vandenberg AFB, CA (14 AF, 30 SW).

3.  Disparate service levels and performance criteria are not conducive to the efficient operation of the AFSPC enterprise network in an ever-evolving AF environment.  The AFPSC Uni-Comm project will professionalize AFSPC enterprise networks through centralized management and standardized tactics, techniques and procedures in accordance with Air Force and Department of Defense guidance.  The scope of the Uni-Comm effort will mirror the U.S. Air Force Concept of Operations for Air Force Network Operations, Nov 2004, and other Air Force initiatives where appropriate.  This project shall be conducted in accordance with current Air Force acquisition planning efforts and shall leverage best business practices.  

4.  AFSPC contemplates industry involvement with the Uni-Comm project prior to release of any final Request for Proposal through the release of draft requirements documents, statements of work, and acquisition strategy documents for comment and recommendation.

5.  Industry Day.  AFSPC will host an industry day on 28 July 2005 to present a detailed briefing introducing the Uni-Comm project.  An open forum question and answer session will be conducted following the briefing.  In addition, one-on-one discussions can be arranged for this first industry day upon request, but the discussions will be for the purpose of providing information (for acquisition planning and developing the Uni-Comm solicitation) to the Air Force Uni-Comm team's use; the Air Force Uni-Comm team will not use these one-on-one discussions to provide additional information to potential offerors.

Attendance at this event, or participation in any associated event, is not mandatory and does not preclude a potential offeror from participation in the planned Uni-Comm acquisition.  Briefings presented by the Uni-Comm team will be posted to FedBizOpps before or after the Industry Day.


  *  Briefing Date:  28 July 2005.

  *  Location at Peterson AFB:  Building 1 (HQ AFSPC), Auditorium.
         (Auditorium is located at Building 1 entrance on East side of building and does not
          require a badge or access to the controlled area in the building).

  *  Time:    Start:  0900,    End:  1600.

  *  Point of Contact for Arranging Access to Peterson AFB:

         Name:  John Vaughan.
         Office Symbol:   AFSPC CSS/SCT.
         Phone Number:   (719) 567-5679.

          Phone Number:  (719) 567-5679.
          e-mail address:  Paul.Vieira@Peterson.AF.mil

One-on-Ones, if requested.  NOTE:  Please indicate by 24 July 05, prior to Industry Day, if you desire a one-on-one session.  Sessions will be scheduled to begin the afternoon of Industry Day, but depending on the number of sessions requested could extend into the following day.  Location:  Planned to be in the same area as Building 1.  Formal room placement to be announced at Briefing to Industry.  Estimated time:  Not more than 2 hours per contractor team for this initial session  Final scheduling will be determined based on number of requests for one-on-one sessions.

6.  It is anticipated that a second industry day will be held to review the draft statement of work and conduct one-on-one question and answer sessions with industry.  Announcements for additional industry day(s), one-on-one discussions on concepts and draft documents and postings of draft documents for comment will be by future FedBizOpps announcements.

7.  Additionally, AFSPC respectfully requests that industry, should they so desire, provide comments or answers for the following questions via e-mail no later that 24 July 2005; send responses to the contracting officer, Stephen Cooper, 50 CONS/LGCZW, e-mail address: stephen.cooper@schriever.af.mil.

  a.  What challenges and operational impacts do you foresee in consolidating core, command-wide enterprise communications and information technology (IT) capabilities and services?  What requirements are paramount to be addressed in this level of effort?  What type of approach (e.g., teaming arrangement for management, level of operations, involvement of small business companies) would you recommend?

  b.  Warfighter customers (Numbered Air Force (NAF), Center and Wing commanders) are concerned that they will lose current capabilities, and could also lose the ability to directly influence capabilities and services under the command-wide Uni-Comm consolidated contract.  What methods or procedures would you suggest to provide the warfighting customers operational insight, local control of contract execution, and influence on level of service provided?  How would you propose to ensure each location receives the necessary (and desired) level of service at least at the level currently required?

  c.  In order to consolidate all core communications and IT capabilities and services at the MAJCOM level, existing contracts may transition in their entirety or be modified to allow de-scoping and transitioning. Currently, core enterprise information technology networks and services for AFSPC are provided by multiple contracts with periods of performance ending in Fiscal Year (FY) 07 through FY 12.  In order to minimize transition costs and impacts to current contracts, AFSPC intends to implement a phased transition approach over a 5-year period.  What problems do you foresee with this approach? What type of transition planning would you recommend?  What type of contracting vehicle, performance assessment approach, and incentive programs would you recommend?

  d.  In order to consolidate all core communications and IT capabilities and services at the MAJCOM level, several existing base-level contracts already consolidated across the installation (those including IT and communications as part of a complete base or installation-wide contracting vehicle) will need to be de-scoped for transitioning.  The Wings are concerned that cross utilization efficiencies and synergies realized by consolidating all base functions will be lost.  How would you plan for this, keeping in mind the need to mitigate this concern?

Responses are intended for market research and acquisition planning by the Uni-Comm team; as such, we may incorporate some or all responses into any solicitation document under the Uni-Comm program to improve the acquisition.  A summary of information received will be posted in a future notice to FedBizOpps.  Submission of any information considered proprietary prior to the release of the formal solicitation should be deferred until discussed with the contracting officer.  No proprietary information or response is requested or expected at this time.

8.  Note:  Information in this notice, such as the NAICS code and locations of performance are preliminary only and subject to change during acquisition planning.  The solicitation, when released, will have the final requirement.

9.  General information for contractors can be found at:  http://www.schriever.af.mil/50cons/

The Office of the Legal Adviser, Department of State (DOS), has a requirement to replace the current SAN to provide adequate storage space and state-of-the-art technology and to insure the availability of the millions of pages of potential evidence in the litigation.  In addition, we plan to use the current SAN at the disaster recovery site and thus, need to utilize the same contractor for continuity of service.  This justification and approval to procure using brand name only covers the necessary equipment/services needed to upgrade our DotHill Storage Area Network (SAN).   The SAN is dedicated to providing large amounts of storage to 6 servers of various operating systems in a network.   This also allows the same servers to provide the same data which creates a fail safe network. Our current DotHill SAN has been in place since 2001 and its SanNet1 technology has been replaced with SanNet2 technology.  At the current utilization rates we will exceed the SAN's capacity within the year.  The contract will require a solution that meets NEBS Level 3 and MILSPEC 810S certification for high reliability and uptime that is required for this mission critical project. This solution must also provide 8 built-in fibre ports that will eliminate the need of purchasing a separate fibre switch.  The SAN1 system being replaced will be moved to a remote site where it will be available as a contingency system.   This will require standardization between both systems.  Both the software and hardware configurations would need to be identical between these two systems to allow for the transition to the contingency system in the event of an emergency.  The Office of the Legal Adviser (L) represents the United States in international litigation.  The effectiveness of the U.S. position in this litigation depends upon the system enhancements and maintenance to insure the continued operation of this mission critical system. The L/CID upgrade of the SAN solution will assist in the establishment of our disaster recovery system since the current SAN will be used as the core component; staying with the same manufacturer allows both systems to 'act and play' as a single system

The details of this arrangement are listed in clause SMC H006 of the Model Contract.  Potential Offerors having objections to non-Government personnel participating in the evaluation of proposals and/or contract documentation including resultant contract administration activities shall contact the PCO prior to submitting their proposals.  

J.	BASIS FOR AWARD:  Contract award decisions, if any, will be based on an evaluation of which proposals or parts of proposals best further the Government objectives in the GPS OCX PRDA effort and on the availability of funding.  The Government intends to make multiple awards with one small business set-aside.  The selection of none, one, or more sources for award will be based on an evaluation of each Offeror’s proposal (both technical and cost/price aspects) to determine the overall merit of the proposal in response to the GPS OCX PRDA.  Proposals are evaluated solely on the criteria published in this PRDA.  The proposals will be evaluated based on the following two criteria that are listed in descending order of importance.  No other evaluation criteria will be used.  Each criterion will be evaluated concurrently.


CRITERIA I

Mission Capability
The Offeror’s proposal will be evaluated separately for both technical content and program management on how well the proposal will achieve the overall PRDA objectives.  The evaluation will focus on the understanding demonstrated and the effectiveness of the Offeror’s proposed solution for:

a.	Offeror’s understanding of the technical scope and approach in accomplishing the objectives of the SOO and execution of the CSOW
b.	Degree of innovation displayed (balanced by lessons learned, best practices, and proven technologies)
c.	Management approach to accomplish the objectives of the SOO and execution of the CSOW
d.	Approved subcontracting goals (as applicable)

CRITERIA II

Cost/Price: Cost/Price includes the reasonableness and realism of the proposed cost and fee and consideration of proposed budgets and funding profiles.  Although an important discriminator, Mission Capability is significantly more important than Cost/Price.  The Offeror’s cost/price proposal will be evaluated using one or more of the techniques in FAR 15.404, in order to determine if it is reasonable and realistic.

No other evaluation criteria will be used.  The technical and cost proposals will be evaluated concurrently.

The Evaluation Teams will produce and document findings that thoroughly identify and describe strengths, weaknesses, and deficiencies associated with each Offeror’s proposal when evaluated against each evaluation criteria.  Any information or data incorporated by reference or referral will not be considered.

Mission Capability Technical Merit ratings will be rated: Outstanding – a significant or exceptional aspect of an Offeror’s proposal that has merit and exceeds expectations in a way beneficial to the Air Force and will be included in the contract or inherent in an Offeror’s process; Good – meets expectations; Marginal – aspect of or omission from proposal that may contribute to a failure in meeting specified minimum objectives; Unacceptable – materiel failure to meet objectives; or Unique – may not meet all Air Force objectives but offers a unique innovation that justifies special consideration.  Mission Capability  Program Management will be rated Acceptable – Yes or No. Cost/Price rating will be Reasonableness (“Yes” or “No”) and Realism (“Yes” or “No”).

K.	DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS: The delivery address for proposals is: SMC/GPK (Attn: Carol Laechelt), Los Angeles Air Force Base, 2400 South Pacific Avenue, Building 410, Fort MacArthur, San Pedro CA 90731.  Personal delivery of proposals or delivery other than on 20 June 2005 shall be coordinated 24 hours in advance of the proposed due date/time with the PCO to ensure timely submission.  Complete proposals must be received by 1200 hours (noon) on Tuesday, 21 June 2005 Pacific Daylight Time.  Offerors shall pre-coordinate delivery time with either the PRDA PCO (Carol Laechelt) or the PRDA Deputy Program Manager (Capt Grant Leeds).

L.	AWARD NOTIFICATION: The PCO will notify Offerors whose proposals have not been selected for negotiation/award as soon as possible.  When a proposal is not selected for award, an Offeror may submit a written request for pre-award debriefing in accordance with FAR 15.505(a).  Any post-award debriefing of Offerors shall be accomplished in accordance with FAR 15.506.

M.	DATA RIGHTS:  The Government assumes that since this is research and development funded exclusively with government funds related to GPS OCX, all technical data developed or used in the course of this program are provided with unlimited rights.  All system architecture risks and associated risk assessments will be provided with unlimited rights.  Offeror(s) shall comply with DFARS 252.227-7013 Rights in Technical Data-Noncommercial Items, DFARS 252.227-7014 Rights in Noncommercial Computer Software and Noncommercial Computer Software Documentation and DFARS 252.227-7017 Identification and Assertion of Use, Release, or Disclosure Restrictions.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR INFRARED EMITTANCE TEST CHAMBER.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to answer a question regarding the electopolish finish. The question and answer is as follows: QUESTION: Can the engineer be a little more specific about the term " Mirror Finish" for the chamber? The term "mirror finish" is a bit subjective.  Is it literally a finish like that on a bathroom mirror for instance, or is a cold finished stainless steel that has been electro polished acceptable? Is the purpose of the interior surface to be highly reflective for the use as part of the Infrared equipment that it is going to be used with? ANSWER: The intent of the electopolish finish is not be like a bathroom mirror which would be capable of reflecting light to some detector.	The intent is to make the chamber easier to clean and reduce the amount of surface area in the chamber to reduce outgassing.  A good website for information on the electo-polishing process is  http://www.electropolish.com/  .  The due date for receipt of offers is not extended.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 6/30/2005. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.  These documents reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>Amendment-02 for Solicitation RFQ-NCI-50061-NV is being issued to answer questions received from an interested vendor.  The due date for proposals is changed to August 1, 2005 at 1:00PM EDT.

Question 1:

What quantitation limits does the NCI need for these four analytes?

Answer 1:

1-OHP:  0.1 ng/L (urine volume: 0.5 mL)
2-naphthol:  0.5 ng/ml (0.5 mL urine)
MDA:  0.05 umol/L (50 ul urine)
8-OHdG:  0.5 ng/ml (50 ul urine)

Question 2:

What is the sample size that is expected to be available for the analysis?

Answer 2:

Sample volume sizes are in parentheses above.



This is a combined synopsis/solicitation to procure the analysis of 1000 urine samples for two PAH metabolites (1-OHP, 2-naphthol) and two oxidative stress markers (8-OHdG, MDA). The services herein are commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance FAR 12  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will NOT be issued.  This solicitation RFQ-NCI-50061-NV includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-04.  

The North American Industry Classification code is 541380, and the business size standard is $6M.  This solicitation is NOT set-aside for small businesses.

BACKGROUND:  PAHs have shown to cause mammary cancer in experimental animals. Some epidemiological studies have shown significant associations between breast cancer and occupational exposure to PAHs, active and passive smoking, and consumption of well-done meats which contains high levels of PAHs.  Although these are potentially important exposures for breast cancer, the evidence is not clear.  Exposure assessment for epidemiologic studies is based on information from interviews.  Measurements of urinary PAH metabolites in subjects with PAHs exposure in an epidemiological study would reduce misclassification of exposure and provide information on total PAH exposure.  Simultaneous measurements of 1-OHP and 2-naphthol would, therefore, provide better understanding of the total, as well as route-specific, PAH exposure and help clarify the relation of these chemicals with the risk of breast cancer.  There is growing interest in the role of oxidative stress from chemicals like these and breast cancer development because of cross-talk between oxidative stress and hormonal imbalance.  There are, however, a limited number of population-based studies of oxidative stress and breast cancer.  Among several biomarkers of oxidative stress, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and malondiadelyde (MDA) are most frequently used because of their biological importance and the sensitivity of the assay.

CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor shall perform the following tasks on 1000 urine samples sent all at one time:  1) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 1-OHP;  2) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 2-naphthol;  3) Analyze 1000 urine samples for 8-OHdG; 4) Analyze 1000 urine samples for MDA; and 5) Provide results of the analyses in an Excel spreadsheet to the Project Officer containing sample ID, test-date, test results and if applicable, quality control data. GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITES:  NCI will ship the 1000 urine samples on dry ice. Samples will be coded and will not have any personal identifiers attached.

EVALUATION CRITERIA:  Offers will be evaluated based on the following technical criteria.  The technical portion 	of the proposal will receive paramount consideration in selecting a vendor.  However, price will also be a significant factor in the event that two or more vendors are determined to be essentially equal following the evaluation of technical factors.  1)  Technical Approach – 50% proposed methods for measurements of urinary metabolites of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and biomarkers of oxidative stress must be sound and fully described. The proposed approach must be consistent with the stated goals and objectives of the Statement of Work i.e., measurements for 2 biomarkers of PAH metabolites and 2 biomarkers of oxidative stress.  2)  Experience  - 40% the proposed staff must have experience in conducting analyses described in the Statement of Work, including similar efforts,  Measurements of urinary metabolites of PAHs and oxidative stress for groups of Chinese women and children is a plus.   3)	Understanding of the problem – 10% must demonstrate that the proposed approach, including appropriateness of allocation and effort of proposed personnel and allocation of resources, is sufficient to accomplish the tasks in the Statement of Work. Adequate plans for quality control and timely delivery of products must be provided.  4)  Costs –is a consideration but not scored.
