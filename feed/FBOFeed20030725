<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c), with American Dental Association Health Foundation (ADAHF), of Gaithersburg, Maryland, to acquire services for the characterization of polymer crystallinity in gradient libraries using infrared microscopy.  Services are required for the Polymers Division at NIST. *****Sole source determination is based on the Government's need for a combination of skills to perform the following: characterization of polymer films using infrared microscopy; measurement of the composition, degree of crystallinity, degree of degradation, and protein adsorption of polymeric materials, of a combinatorial library format.  Materials will be model dental materials and the ADAHF will consult in determining appropriate test conditions for making comparisons with real dental materials.  The ADAHF is uniquely qualified to perform the required services because they have the capability of providing a combination of researchers that includes both scientists and dental clinicians.  Using the combined expertise, the ADAHF is able to provide high-quality spectroscopic characterization of dental materials with focus on clinically relevant measurements, and also to analyze the results and provide crucial comparisons with clinically relevant materials, thus making translation of laboratory research possible.*****The period of performance will be a twelve-month base year, plus one option period of twelve months.*****The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541690, and the size standard is $6.0 million.*****No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations.  However, responses received by August 8, 2003, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.*****See Numbered Note 26.*****

Provide Armstrong RADA 4DR or equivalent mixing valves.  These valves must have integral check valves and be certified as being compliant with ASSE Standard 1017.  The thermostatic mixing valves must sense recirculating water temperature in order to prevent overshooting the output temperature.

The 130-degree F. output temperature must be maintained at flow rates from 2 GPM to 43 GPM.  Outlet and inlet thermometers with appropriate ranges shall be installed along with each mixing valve.  The solicitation will address the sizing of existing hard copper piping at each building.  All new piping installed as well as any existing insulation that is removed shall be insulated with a minimum of 1 1/2" fiberglass insulation and covered with a protective outer jacket.  Since these hot water heaters primarily serve medical care buildings, the timeframe for hot water interruption must be limited to a maximum of two (2) hours.  The completion date is 30 calendar days from issuance of the Notice to Proceed.  Cost range is between $25,000 and $100,000.  Award is subject to the availability of funds.

<CONTACT>Judy Jennings Chief, Concessions Management 3039692661     ;
<DESC>Description The National Park Service intends to issue a Prospectus to solicit proposals for two concession contracts to provide calmwater motorboat interpretive tours, transportation, and cargo hauling services for the general public in Canyonlands National Park.  The Prospectus will be issued July 28, 2003, for a 145-day response period and proposals are due on December 19, 2003, no later than 4:00 p.m.  The concession contracts require calmwater motorboat interpretive tours lasting for one day or less, canoe haul-out services, and transportation of people on the Green and Colorado Rivers above the confluence of these rivers and no farther downstream than Spanish Bottom on the Colorado River within Canyonlands National Park.  The concession contracts authorize cargo hauling services and "drop-off" and "pick-up" services for backcountry users along the river corridors on the Green and Colorado Rivers above the confluence of these rivers and no farther downstream than Spanish Bottom on the Colorado River.  These businesses are seasonal in nature with most services occurring from March 1 through October 31.  Services will be provided on a daily basis during this primary use period.  No government owned facilities or structures are assigned in the park for concessioners' use.  Concessioners will locate their offices, support facilities, and warehouses outside the park's boundaries.   The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR Part 51, has determined that the current concessioners have a right of preference in renewal of the contracts.  The current concession permits expire December 31, 2003.  The length of the new contracts will be for ten (10) years.  There is a printing cost recovery charge of $35 per Prospectus to be delivered via Federal Express (please provide a Federal Express address not a post office box number) or $30 per copy if picked up in person.  Checks or money orders must be payable to the National Park Service.  Cash cannot be accepted.  Prospectuses are available by contacting Judy Jennings, Chief, Business Resources Division, National Park Service, Intermountain Region, P.O. Box 25287, Denver, CO 80225-0278 (express mail address: 12795 West Alameda Parkway, Lakewood, CO 80228).  Inquires may be directed to (303) 969-2661 or judy_jennings@nps.gov.

<DESC>The Contracting Office, AAC/WMO, Eglin AFB FL, intends to issue a one-year contract with two 1-year options for Interim Contractor Support (ICS) to the Deployable Power Generation and Distribution System (DPGDS).  The total period of performance of the base year contract for this new effort will be from 1 Dec 03 to 30 Nov 04, with two 1-year option periods with the first option year starting on 1 Dec 04 and ending on 30 Nov 05 and the second option year starting on 1 Dec 05 ending 30 Nov 06.  The Government may or may not choose to exercise the option year periods.  Currently the Government has a time and materials contract that was awarded as a sole source procurement with Radian Incorporated of Alexandria, Virginia, which runs from 1 Dec 02 to 30 Nov 03.  This new contract will cover at least the same tasks and scope as the existing ICS contract with Radian.  The DPGDS is made up of a 920KW prime power unit (MEP-PU-810A & B), primary switching center, secondary distribution center, various power distribution panels, remote area lighting system, cable reel pallet assembly, expeditionary fuel system, and various cabling and hardware. The following provides a list of some of the tasks required under this ICS contract: (1) Supply Support: The Contractor shall establish and maintain a supply and transportation priority system providing DPGDS parts and establish a worldwide distribution system.

The Contractor shall ship all parts by priority transportation to the requesters point of origin within 3 business days of its receipt of the request from the Program Office for priority orders and within 7 calendar days of the request for routine orders. When commercial transportation is used, the Contractor is responsible for delays, lost or damaged materials and shall remain obligated to meet the performance requirements of this contract. If Government transportation is directed, the Contractor will ensure that all documentation, marking, labeling, preparation, and packaging are in accordance with appropriate Government regulations and provide pick-up and delivery of all assets as directed by the Government Contracting Office, to/from Air Force Traffic Management Office. (2) Technical Services: The Contractor shall provide technical services to include maintaining and dispatching anywhere in the world, a Field Service Support Team with expertise specifically on the MEP-PU-810A & B Prime Power Units and additional distribution equipment, The Support Team must perform repairs and solve complex maintenance problems that are beyond the Government's capability, and provide On-The-Job-Training (OJT) as required.

The Contractor will ensure that their designated technical service representatives remain current in standard worldwide immunizations and maintain a passport. The Contractor personnel assigned to provide technical support shall obtain a passport through contractor resources and must comply with the security requirements listed in Industrial Security Manual, DOD and Air Force Series Regulations, and the contract DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification. These personnel will possess a minimum of a Secret security clearance. The Contractor will ensure a ready-to-depart capability within two business days (plus visa acquisition time, if required) of notification from the Government. Travel provisions will be based on the Government Joint Travel Regulations. Specific tasks to be accomplished include but are not limited to: on-site troubleshooting and repair of end-items, Line Replaceable Units, and/or components of the DPGDS; and provide OJT and informal instruction in DPGDS operation, maintenance, installation, removal, and system troubleshooting with special emphasis on safety. This OJT will be authorized and performed by the Contractor only in conjunction with an authorized site repair and only upon approval of the Government. Technical Services will be charged to the Government on Time and Materials CLINs using agreed to rates. (3) ICS and Warranty Management: The Governments DPGDS Performance Specification will be used by the Contractor to validate parts substitution/interchangeability to ensure they meet the required form, fit, and function (or other essential characteristics) of the original part. Whenever any DPGDS part is changed, substituted and/or modified, the Contractor will update all existing DPGDS documentation and provide the Government all source data and change pages required to update existing Commercial Technical Manuals (CTMs), or provide new DPGDS CTMs, if required. This data will be provided to the Government within 30 calendar days of any change being implemented. The Contractor will manage spares levels, demand data, as well as tracking of parts and historical records of all processed transactions.  The Contractor will also manage ICS replenishment and repair requirements on all DPGDS unique items to include receiving, approving, processing, and shipping Government-generated requisitions; verifying service agreements and part warranties, and approving shipment of repairable assets from site locations to the appropriate Contractor location; maintaining contact with ICS suppliers and vendors to identify and resolve all part problems such as long lead-time items, discontinued parts, and vanishing vendors; documenting part identification changes, and updating the ICS spares list to reflect correct parts identification information including part interchangeability and substitution data. (4) Spares Analysis: At the end of the ICS period, the Contractor will provide to the Government an LRU, component and repair parts demand data report containing a summary of the following key elements: failure trends, Reliability and Maintainability information, Mean Time Between Failure and Mean Time Between Critical Failure rates, mission criticality, order/ship times, and warranty repairs.

<DESC>The Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) intends to enter into negotiations with Cornerstone Systems Northwest for the purpose of receiving support and utilizations examples for the centralized web-based collaborative application that has been established (known as the CISNET Collaborative Knowledge Base). In September of 2000, the National Cancer Institute funded consortium of simulation modeling groups began the important work of building simulation models to study the impact of cancer control interventions on population and future trends as well as optimal cancer control strategies.  The Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) is a diverse group involving members from over a dozen different organizations at multiple sites around the world.  The contractor shall work with the CISNET member groups assisting them to maintain their model profiles and publish them to the collaborative knowledge base for sharing among all members.  The current user-base includes seventeen CISNET member groups as well as a number of anticipated CISNET "affiliate" groups.  It is critical that the CISNET modelers be given professional guidance in establishing their model profiles so that they are most comparable.  Cornerstone Systems Northwest is the only agency known that can provide the services required to assist with the CISNET members.  The anticipated award date for this sole source acquisition is January 1, 2004 for a period of one base year and three one-year options.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI3072 and is being issued as a Notice of Intent (NOI).  The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14.  This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 339111, which has a size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure on a sole-source basis from the only known manufacture Bio-Rad Laboratories, a Radiance 2100 Multi-Photon Dedicated System, multi-photon only system with no internal detectors and no visible lasers, which includes a) scan head fitted with IR compatible optics and laser input port, instrument control unit and computer interface kit, b) no visible light lasers, c) no internal detectors, but requires direct detectors.  This procurement is for a scanhead/ICU combination.  This is a precision crafted device that must be fully physically compatible with existing equipment (Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 Multiphoton microscope) and also controllable by the existing software to be functional.  Only Bio-Rad manufactures this specific device engineered for the Bio-Rad Radiance installation we currently have.  To procure any other product would require extensive re-engineering of the instrument to be physically compatible, and then would not allow us to use a single software package for operation.  The adaption of the microscope necessary to use other brand devices would also void our warranty and service agreements with Bio-Rad.  The Lymphocyte Biology Division (LBD) is engaged in an effort to image the interactions of immune cells within the tissues of living animals to further understanding of host defenses. For this purpose it has acquired a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 Multiphoton microscope that is capable of generating imaging data deeper within tissues than a standard confocal microscope. These experiments require the use of several colored fluorescent compounds to mark distinct cell types within a single tissue.  There is a significant need to upgrade the existing equipment to provide the highest quality and sensitivity of imaging in multiphoton mode in live animals.  Vendor is to deliver, install, and calibrate the new scanhead and ICU, provide a computer that meets Bio-Rad specification for operation of the new device, provide free two day on site training.

This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business concern.  The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 339111, which has a size standard of 500.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to procure a Benchtop Magnetic Cell Sorter from the only known manufacture Miltenyi Biotec Inc.  The Benchtop Magnetic Cell sorter is proposed as a sole source purchase on the basis that the Cellular Immunology Section is engaged in an effort to isolate very pure, specific cell populations of murine cells with high recovery, including rare cell populations, maintenance of cell viability, rapid sorting capability.  The Benchtop Magnetic Cell Sorter has the ability to handle large samples, high throughput and extremely frequent use.  This instruments technology allows the sorted cell populations to be analyzed by flow cytometry or PCR, in such a way that the magnetic microbeads, on which the technology is based will not interfere with the analysis as they can pass through the flow cytometer without obstruction or do not interfere with PCR amplification. The principle research effort of the Cellular Immunology Section is focused in the area of immune regulation in the pathogenesis and treatment of organ-specific autoimmune disease. The major goal is to further the understanding of the mechanism of action of these regulatory cells in preventing autoimmunity. We have identified a unique population of regulatory CD4+ T-cells which co-express CD25 which are capable of not only suppressing the induction of autoimmune disease in vivo, but also the disease induced by passive transfer of cloned autoantigen-specific effector cells.  In order to perform these experiments we have to be able to select for certain populations of murine cells by utilizing a sorting mechanism that will allow further manipulation, testing, and analysis.  This system has been utilized within our laboratory for several years.  This is the only known system that enables flow cytometry analysis on sorted cells without additional labor to remove the magnetic beads used to sort the cells, which could render the sorted cells unusable for the desired experiments.  Loss of this instrument is severely detrimental to the laboratorys continued research as the majority of our continuing experiments are designed around this technology and it would be cost prohibitive to the laboratory and the overall research goal to alter methodologies.  The unique features include the following: 1) Cell sorting can be performed in as little as 15 minutes 2) Ability to separate large numbers of cells by utilizing different size columns available from the manufacturer 3) Proven ability to withstand extremely high use 4) Technology utilizes microscopic magnetic beads that will not adversely affect sorted populations 5) Compatibility with flow cytometry, PCR and other subsequent experiments and analytic methods of resulting populations without additional labor 6) Sorted populations are available for immediate analysis or experimentation 7) Capability of selecting for very rare cell populations (down to a frequency of 10-8) 8) Manufacturer carries a broad range of reagents allowing for positive or negative selection of specific murine cell profiles 9) Small overall footprint 10) User-friendly design and software.  The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) price, 2) warranty, 3) capability to meet required specifications 4) training of staff 5) set up of equipment 6) Delivery time. Anticipated Date & Place of delivery September 29; NIH/NIAID, Maryland 20892; FOB-D.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: FAR 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-3 Offerors Representations and Certifications Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-4, Contractor Terms and Conditions Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders Commercial Items applies to this acquisition.

<DESC>The National Telecommunications and Information Agency, Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS), Telecommunications Theory Division develops innovative telecommunications techniques and engineering tools through the use of electromagnetic theory; digital signal processing techniques, models of human perception; propagation modeling and noise analysis. ***  An important component of the Division's mission for exploration of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and interference issues is the characterization of emitter waveforms and receiver response characteristics. The technology required to fully characterize these waveforms is more challenging to create than the associated receiver technology. Therefore measurement systems tend to lag behind communication systems in terms of bandwidth, signaltonoise ratio and data rate. This disparity has risen dramatically with the advent of ultrawideband (UWB) and advanced radar systems. These systems can approach emission bandwidths that are on the order of 1 GHz. There currently is no way to perform a full characterization of these waveforms with existing test equipment.  RF spectra are traditionally characterized by measuring the power spectral density across wide frequency ranges using spectrum analyzers. Although spectrum analyzers provide wide frequency tuning capabilities, and techniques have previously been devised by ITS to extend the dynamic range of spectrum analyzer measurements for certain classes of signals, the resulting measurements cannot be used to reconstruct the original waveforms. Measurement techniques that rely upon highspeed digitization of RF waveforms allow partial reconstruction but suffer from limited singleshot bandwidth and poor dynamic range. The Theory Division seeks to produce a measurement with extended dynamic range while preserving all the information required to fully reconstruct original UWB and radar pulse waveforms. The Theory Division needs to develop a novel, cuttingedge tool that will accomplish this goal, and which will be used throughout the NTIA Institute for Telecommunication Sciences (ITS) to combine current analogtodigital (A/D) technologies with a set of variable dynamic range radio frequency (RF) front ends that will overcome existing limitations and provide for full characterization of UWB and radar pulse waveforms.   ***   The SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE AS OF AUGUST 8, 2003.  Please submit a written request (e-mail preferred) to Michelle Sandoval, Purchasing Agent, at Michelle.Sandoval@noaa.gov.  This acquisition will be conducted under the authority of FAR Part 13.106, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (NTE $100K).    FAR provisions in full text are available online at http://www.arnet.gov/far/.  The date for response to the solicitation will be August 27, 2003.  The anticipated award date is September 18, 2003. Although large business responses are welcome, please be advised that small business will receive preference among closely ranked responses.

<SUBJECT>S -- Utility Privatization of Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Systems at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma
<SOLNBR>SP0600-03-R-0130
<RESPDATE>080803

<DESC>DESC: The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Air Force plans to offer the privatization of the electrical, natural gas, water and wastewater infrastructure systems at Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operations, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility system replacements. As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the above-mentioned utility system(s). The successful firm will be required to provide expansions to the system(s) to meet future needs of the government. The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, materials, tools, and equipment necessary to own, maintain, and operate the utility system(s). The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc., of the system(s) to ensure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area. The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, maintain and operate the utility system(s) in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract. Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of a Right-of-Way (ROW) as an attachment to the RFP. The utility system(s) will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract. Past performance information from potential Offerors shall be submitted as directed in the RFP. The utility systems being privatized are described as follows: Installation: Vance Air Force Base, Oklahoma. System Descriptions: Electric, Natural Gas, Water and Wastewater. The electrical distribution system at Vance AFB is through a single 69-kilovolt kV transmission line into a substation located on the north end of the installation, west of Hairston Gate.  The 69 kV transmission line feeds a 69/12.47kV, 7500 KVA transformer.  The 12.47 kV distribution level voltage is fed underground to an electrical switching station, which is adjacent to the OG&E substation but is owned by the Air Force.  The electrical distribution system consists of five 12470/7200 volt three-phase feeders.  The distribution system consists of approximately 78,000 linear feet of underground service and an estimated 25,500 linear feet of overhead service. Vance Air Force Base currently receives a hydropower allocation from the Southwest Power Administration (SWPA). The estimated savings benefit for Vance is approximately $350,000 per year in electric commodity cost. A successful privatization effort would force SWPA to revoke the allocation and distribute it elsewhere. Revocation of the allocation and the resulting economic effect will be included in the governments privatization calculations. The RFP will convey this information. The natural gas distribution system  is supplied to the base by Oklahoma Natural Gas Company via a single four-inch 200 psi supply line which is master-metered at the base perimeter. The distribution system consists of approximately 13 miles of underground main which is normally maintained at 16 psi; the main lines are all wrapped and coated steel pipe with cathodic protection. The water distribution system utilizes water supplied by the City of Enid via a single 10-inch main at approximately 60 psi. The base supply main carries water to a 300,000 gallon ground storage tank; water is pumped from there into a 500,000 gallon, 110 foot elevated storage tank. Water is distributed from that point through approximately 20 miles of mains, 90% of which are constructed of steel. The wastewater system consists of approximately 13.5 miles of sewer mains and one primary lift station and force main; five small lift stations and force mains are used to connect individual facilities into the main system. Wastewater is discharged into the City of Enids sanitary sewer system for treatment. See Note 26. All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered. Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer. Interested sources shall contact Bobby Jones at 703-767-2397 to be added to our bidder mailing list. A copy of the solicitation will be available after issuance, on the Internet at the below listed URL. The solicitation will be available sometime after August 8, 2003 LINKURL: http://www.desc.dla.mil/DCM/DCMPage.asp?pageid=246 LINKDESC: http://www.desc.dla.mil EMAILADD: Robert.E.Jones@dla.mil

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Z -- SOLICITATION NOTICE:  The Government intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to obtain best value construction services of a Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) for the modernization of the Northern Grains Insect Research Laboratory (NGIRL).  PROJECT SUMMARY:  The project will occur in Brookings, South Dakota at the Agricultural Research Service, NGIRL, built in 1960.  The project includes the modernization of the mechanical and plumbing systems of the existing 36,200 square foot facility; renovations to approximately 3,087 square feet of laboratory/office area; and proposed new construction totaling approximately 12,914 square feet.  The building will remain occupied during the project.  Building occupants and research operations must remain fully operational, but may be relocated.  

This procurement will be to complete the pre-construction phase services, with the expectation that this effort will continue into a complete construction/construction management service.  The successful contractor will be required to construct the facility and work with the A/E previously selected by the Government, for both Pre-Construction and Construction activities. 
The CMc will assist the Government in managing the design and construction with an emphasis on meeting goals relating to schedule, budget, scope, and quality.  The CMc provides management, technical, administrative, and quality control services to achieve these goals, as well as for providing construction of the project.  The CMc is required to work with the Architect-Engineer and the Government in a cooperative team effort to develop a quality design.  The A-E will prepare and update all cost estimates for the cost of construction at each stage of the Construction Documents development.  The A-E is obligated to design the project within a specified cost limitation and the CMc will review, analyze, and assess each estimate and limitation and shall prepare a cost estimate report for each A-E design submission.  No later than the submission of the midpoint of construction document, the CMc will prepare their cost proposal for construction.  The cost proposal shall not exceed the estimated cost of construction and will be used by the Government and the CMc to establish a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP).  Source selection procedures per FAR subpart 15.3 shall be utilized.  Evaluation of firms will be made on the following criteria:  (1) Past Performance and Relevant Experience; (2) Schedule and Resources; (3) Key Personnel; (4) Contract Administration; (5) Small Business Subcontracting Plan; and (6) Small Disadvantaged Business Participation Program. All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price.

The completion time is 24 months after the notice to proceed is issued.  The estimated price range for the project is between $5,000,000 and $10,000,000.  The NAICS code is 236220, with a size standard of $28.5 million.  This procurement will be conducted on an unrestricted basis in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program and using negotiated procedures.  Large Business firms will be required to submit a subcontracting plan with goals for small, small disadvantaged, woman-owned small, HUBZone small, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.  A bid bond and Miller Act Performance and Payment Bonds will be required. 

Solicitation No. 23-3K15-03, including the Program of Requirements (POR), will be available for viewing/downloading on FedBizOpps (www.fedbizopps.gov), on or about August 13, 2003.

There will NOT be any drawings or specifications.  TELEPHONE OR FACSIMILE REQUESTS FOR THE SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED. 

A single pre-proposal conference and site visit will be conducted on-site on August 26, 2003.  Attendance at the site visit is not mandatory but it is strongly encouraged.  Minority business contractors are asked to attend the Pre-Proposal Conference and provide copies of their business resumes to potential prime contractors for possible subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>PSC Military Housing Company (PCSMHC), acting on behalf of the Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence (AFCEE), and the Air Combat Command, is pleased to announce the release of its Request for Proposals for the Privatization of Military Family Housing at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. Please note that "Step One" proposals are due no later than 5:00 p.m. local time 18 August 2003, at the offices of PSCMHC. PSCMHC intends to employ a two-step RFP process. In the first step, each prospective offeror (or offeror team) will submit written evidence of its qualifications, experience, references, access to financial resources and a brief summary of its approach to the Cannon AFB project. PSCMHC, with Air Force concurrence, will pre-qualify those offerors that satisfactorily demonstrate their financial and technical capability and understanding of the requirements of the Cannon project. In the second step, up to five qualified offerors will be invited to submit fully specified technical and financial proposals. PSCMHC will evaluate proposals on the basis of evaluation criteria stated in the RFP and recommend a Successful Offeror (SO) to the Government. The Cannon Project involves the construction of 336 units, renovation of 910 units and the demolition of 384 existing units. The objective of this initiative is to provide quality management for the 1,246 unit housing community for a lease period of at least 50 years. The Government expects to contribute leased real property without any improvements, and may subsidize the project's financing to the degree necessary to enter into an agreement with the successful private offeror. The Successful Offeror (SO) will contribute cash equity, will obtain private sector debt, and will be responsible for managing and operating the Cannon family housing inventory. Except in very limited respects, and subject to certain specific cash-reserve requirements, the SO will be entitled to a portion of the project's operating cash flow as specified in the RFP and in the agreements that will be executed after selection of the SO. This transaction is not subject to requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The RFP is available at http://www.pscmhc.com.  Point of Contact Rusty Martin, PSCMHC, Phone (801) 363-2277, Fax (801) 363-1912, Email: rusty@psc-evg.com.

Sheet 2 contained draft government estimate information. The solicitation, attachments, and all other project information were erroneously deleted from this website the morning of July 22, 2003, but reposted the evening of that same day.  The reposted solicitation also included Attachment 2, Evaluation Matrix; however, sheet 2 had been deleted.  This modification is being issued to provide sheet 2 to afford all vendors the same information.  Please note that we did not intend for sheet 2 to be posted on July 18, 2003.  SHEET 2 DOES NOT CONTAIN THE CURRENT, COMPLETE GOVERNMENT ESTIMATE, AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON FOR PROPOSAL PURPOSES.  Also note that we will not be posting the current, complete government estimate.

<DESC>THE CLOSING DATE REMAINS UNCHANGED.  QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS: 1. Reference page 1.b. of Proposal Instructions.  The Instructions include the following language.  "Please note that there are no provisions for acceptance of late offers sent by overnight courier service (except by U.S. Postal Service Mail), regardless of the date of mailing."  We assume that DOT will accept overnight courier deliveries of the proposal made if received on or prior to the proposal due date.  Is this correct?  If so, should we consider this to be 12 hours of interpreters on site on Mondays?  This same question would be applicable to the other days of the week. The Government will except any timely proposal from whichever mail courier the offeror selects.  The government does not understand the second portion of the question and therefore can not respond. 2. Reference page 5 of the solicitation, Description of Policies with Regard to Cancellation of Service or Requests for Additional on Call Interpreters.  Is the offeror to include responses to these requests for policies in the proposal or is this to be provided after contract award?  If it is to be included in the proposal, in which volume should the responses be included?  If this is to be included in the Technical Volume, do the responses count against the 10-page maximum page limit?  Because the questions request cost information, we assume that the responses would be included in the Cost/Price volume. If the offeror has a Cancellation Policy they should include it in their proposal. They do not have to have a policy but there will be times when cancellations will occur and we will not want to pay for services we don't received.  If they have an hourly limit prior to services be delivered, they should state it.  Policy itself should be addressed in the Technical Proposal and will not included against the 10 page limit.  3. Reference Synopsis and Ordering Section of the SOW.  The Synopsis states that the anticipated contract is a firm-fixed-price contract.  The Ordering Section of the SOW states that the government will only pay for hours ordered - this sounds like the Government requests a Time and Materials Basis.  Please clarify how the offeror should provide its pricing information. The Government intents to award a firm-fixed price IDIQ contract.  The hourly rate will be fixed based on the proposed rates and the number of hours worked will be indefinite until some point in time.  The fixed loaded hourly rates should be based on the estimated hours as stated in Section B.  4. Reference Proposal Instructions.  It is stated that the offeror should submit One (1) original and one (1) copy of its proposal.  The number of copies requested for the Technical volume is not stated.  Please clarify the number of original and reproduced copies that are requested of this volume. One (1) original and one (1) copy of the entire proposal which includes a technical volume and a price volume is required. 5. Reference SOW page 2, Item 3. The SOW indicates that the contractor should "Provide one additional on-site interpreter, who will be designated by the Contractor as the on-site Interpreter Coordinator.  Is this position in addition to the time indicated in the schedule included in Item 2 on page 2?  For example, on Monday 1 interpreter is required for 6 hours.  Would the  Interpreter Coordinator also be on site for this 6 hour period? Yes, it is in addition to the on-call interpreters. 6. Reference SOW page 2 and Proposal Instructions page 4.  Please clarify the expectations of time for the interpreter and Interpreter Coordinator.  Based on the table of Core Interpreters on page 2 of the SOW, 75 hours per week would be expected for the Core Team of interpreters.  Based on the role of the Interpreting Coordinator, 40 hours per week would be expected.  On an annual basis, this equates to 5,980 hours.  The Pricing Information page (page 4 of the Proposal Instructions indicates 3 categories of service and estimated hours as follows:  0001 - 2,008 hours, 0002 - 3,846 hours and 0003 - 416 hours.  Please confirm that 0001 is for the Interpreting Coordinator and 0002 are for the Primary Interpreters.  Please confirm also that the 0003 code is for on call time for interpreters.  Confirmed.  7. Reference Proposal Instructions page 6, topic Ordering. This section contains the following sentence: The Government will only pay for the hours ordered, subject o the parameters for cancellation charges identified in the contract. This sounds like a time and materials contract rather than Firm Fixed Price.  Please clarify the nature of the contract. See response to Question 3 above . 8. Reference Proposal Instruction page 1, section c. This section suggests that the proposals include Tab indices.  The instructions also require that the proposals be printed on both sides of the paper.  With a maximum limit of 10 pages for the Technical Proposal Volume, it would seem that the use of Tabs would be difficult to satisfy the page limit.  Please confirm how the Government wishes the proposals to be packaging in regard to double-sided printing and the use of Tabs. The tabs pages are not included in the 10 page limit.  The Government's requirement as stated in Proposal Instruction, Volume 1-Technical Proposal , Section C is unchanged.

Q23.  Do you have an estimate of the number and type of cases that may be provided to the contractor to review and handle? 

 

A23.  No, in that there will be review of long term and newly received cases, it is hard to determine at this time. 

 

Q24.  Can the contractor enter the cases into its own case management system or must it enter into DLA's system?  Does DLA have an automated system, and if so, what kind?  WIll the contractor be given access to that system?

Q25.  It is understood that not all work would have to be completed at the government site.  What kind of work would have to be carried out at the site?  Is it contemplated that the contractor could pick up case files from the DLA Center and transport them to the contractor site for review/activities and then return the file to DLA at an appropriate time? 

 

A25.  Not all work will have to be performed at the site, however, Project Manager will make determination as to work that can be performed away from the DLA facility.

No additional questions will be entertained.

(Relative importance - 30) 
 
3. Current and Past Performance: The supplier must provide information and references to document a record of satisfactory performance on contracts of similar magnitude. Satisfactory performance as defined by the Postal Service is (1) quality of service, (2) timeliness of performance, and (3) customer satisfaction. Suppliers should provide proof of timeliness of performance (adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance). Suppliers should be able to prove good customer relations (a history of being reasonable and cooperative with customers; commitment to customer satisfaction, integrity and ethics).

5. Financial responsibility: Suppliers must provide adequate information to demonstrate their financial capability, and indicate if the company has the necessary working capital and/or other resources to perform the contract. Evidence of financial stability as indicated by the suppliers credit history will be one aspect of the evaluation.

This Sources Sought Synopsis is for the purpose of identifying potential sources.  The work to be performed encompasses basic custodial services in the Base Medical Clinics, the Child Development Centers, the Base Fitness Centers, and general commercial-type office facilities.  Custodial services required involve three types of standards:  quality standards, frequency standards, and performance standards.  Quality standards require that appropriate surfaces are free of dirt, debris, lint, smudges, streaks, etc.  Frequency standards require cleaning tasks to be performed at certain times, i.e., weekly, twice weekly, three times weekly, etc.  Performance standards are based on the number of defects permitted before a service is considered unsatisfactory. In all Medical facilities and Child Development Centers, the required cleaning is 100% Total Clean that is defined by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO).  The Custodial Services solicitation will include a requirement that work performed in the LAAFB medical facilities will be accomplished by Hospital Aseptic Management System (HAMS) certified personnel.  Immunizations, health screening, and personnel background investigations will be required of employees working in some areas.  At this time, Child Development Centers, Fitness Centers, and all office facilities total approximately 912,089 square feet and all Medical facilities total approximately 53,563 square feet and are located at LAAFB in El Segundo, Lawndale and San Pedro, CA.  Interested parties are requested to submit a Statement of Capability to enable the Government to ascertain the appropriate level of competition.  Capability Statements should address experience and qualifications in performing custodial services in medical, childcare and fitness center environments as well as general office building environments.

<SOLNBR>N0016403Q6625
<RESPDATE>081003
<CONTACT>DOUG MCDANIEL
<DESC>The Navy is seeking information on a replacement for the Marine Corps Stinger Missile.  In this Stinger Missile Replacement (SMR) effort, it is the Marine Corps desire to find a potential solution and gather technical and cost information to plan and budget for future requirements.  Potential technologies to be considered include kinetic energy, missile, directed energy, or others that could meet the requirements of this Request For Information (RFI).  The following are the tentative requirements of the SMR: (a) The SMR must be man-portable, with desired weight less than twenty-five pounds, and desired length less than sixty inches; (b) The SMR primary role will be as a Ground-to-Air (G-A) weapon.  Anticipated air targets include unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), helicopters, fixed wing (jet / Cessna-like), and ultra-lights.  It is desired that the SMR have the ability to engage  cruise missiles; (c) It is desired that the SMR have a secondary role as a Ground-to-Ground (G-G) weapon.  Anticipated ground targets include trucks, shelters, generator houses, and lightly armored vehicles; (d) The SMR may be utilized from shoulder or other stationary positions.  If utilized from shoulder, must be man-rated.  The SMR must be able to be utilized from an enclosure, with consideration of operator safety due to blast and recoil.  Other anticipated locations for employment include urban, shipboard, V-22, and Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC).  Ease of employment is a key consideration; (e) The SMR shall be capable of being operated in all environmental conditions, day and night.  It shall be capable of operating in temperatures ranging from -40.0 degrees Celsius to +51.67 degrees Celsius (-40 degrees Fahrenheit to +125 degrees Fahrenheit) and from 0% to 100% humidi ty.  The system must be fully capable of conducting worldwide operations in conventional and contingency combat operations including tactical nuclear, biological, and chemical warfare environments.  When subjected to the effects of a nuclear blast, the SMR should be at least as survivable as the Marine operating the weapon.  The SMR should be designed for use with mission oriented protective posture clothing level (4) and also compatible with current protective helmets and masks.  The SMR shall possess a chemical and biological survivability capability equal to the Stinger missile system.  The system can be expected to be in actual operation for a range of twelve to twenty-four hours a day. The average mission length will be 12 hours; (f) The SMR must have an effective range equivalent to or better than the current Stinger Missile for acquisition and engagement.  It is desired  that multiple warhead options for different effects be included.  The SMR must provide full operational capability within 90 seconds (required) from initial turn-on. An initial turn-on time of 10 seconds is desired.  Initial turn-on time is defined as the time required for the system to become energized "warm-up" and thus fully operational; (g) The SMR must have provisions for use with a Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) transmitter/receiver.  The SMR must be capable of all IFF Modes, including Mode 4, with migration path to Mode 5.   IFF must be simpler than the current STINGER system, or, if possible, transparent to the user.  The IFF must work in joint, interagency, and multinational (JIM) environments: (h) The SMR must be insensitive to expected Hazards of Electromagnetic Radiation to Ordnance (HERO), Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), and Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) en vironments; (i) The SMR is desired to have a per unit cost of less than $95K; (j) The SMR should be minimal smoke, with minimal launch signature.  Non-attribution is desired; (k) The SMR will be capable of being air delivered in its organic hard carrying case with the individual Marine during the assault phase of an airborne and/or amphibious operation.  The device will be capable of surviving environments associated with air drop (e.g. thermal shock, pressure change, moisture/condensation penetration, water submersion, shock and vibration); (l) The SMR must include tamper proof technology.  The ability to disable lost weapons is desired; (m) The device will be sufficiently ruggedized to withstand and/or be protected from the abrasive effects (e.g. pitting and scratching) and the penetration of blowing sand and dust particles while operating. The design of the system should als o prohibit the penetration of water, moisture, condensation, and salt spray; (n) The device will comply with applicable safety, health and human engineering requirements and not present uncontrolled safety and health hazards to personnel. As a minimum, the provisions of Military Standards 454, 882, and 1472 will apply to the system; (o) The SMR must perform its mission in the presence of airborne countermeasures.

<DESC>Sources Sought Notice Activity Address NSWC Indian Head Detachment Earle, 201 Highway 34 South, Colts Neck NJ 07722 Description The purpose of this Sources Sought Notice is to identify potential sources of novel materials that may be capable of mitigating the effects of packaged explosive commodities intended for military use. Desired materials must be lightweight and capable of being fabricated for weapon packaging applications at a reasonable cost. Materials currently being examined for this application include fibers such as S2 glass, synthetic fibers, pumice, glass composite armor, fiber-metal laminates, and metallic foams. Additional materials or variations of these materials, having the potential of possessing the desired properties are being sought for assessment. Current objective is to design a lightweight container, approximately fifty (50) pounds and eight ( 8) cubic feet in size that is capable of containing the blast effects of one pound of C-4.  The proposed container is to demonstrate capability only, i.e. mitigation/containment of blast impulse and shock waves. Continued research will be conducted to develop a practical technology. Future efforts include examining promising materials that will contain both blast and fragmentation effects of a packaged explosive item.  Please appropriately and precisely mark all proprietary information to be submitted in response to this source request notice. In any response to be submitted to this notification, the following information is desired for any material being considered: 1. Specific Strength (tensile strength x 10^3 / specific gravity)  2.

Specific requirements under the contract will be: (1) the ability to service all areas within the Fort Meade Military Reservation and all Federal service premises currently served by Government owned systems that are the subject of this requirement; (2) the ability to provide access to two [2] independent potable water sources to provide redundant supply linkage.  Independent potable water sources are two separate sources of supply from two separate treatment facilities.  One area of consideration [as a source] may be the existing Fort Meade plant.  

PROCESS:  This request is to gather information from interested parties and is an essential step in determining market interest for the privatization of the water and wastewater utility systems at Fort Meade, MD. In order to minimize costs both to potentially interested parties and the government, this notice is issued to determine market interest and feasibility as well as determining marketing strategies for privatizing the utility systems.  Should insufficient credible interest be identified for a privatization action, it is highly likely that no formal solicitation will be issued.  Should interest be determined sufficient, a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) may be forthcoming.   Interested parties should provide a statement of interest on company letterhead.  The statement of interest must not exceed a total length of 15 pages.

<SUBJECT>99 -- Homeland Security Centers of Excellence
<DESC>Background and Context:  
The Department of Homeland Security expects the United States academic community to play an integral role in securing the Nation.  To facilitate this involvement, the Office of University Programs, within the Science and Technology division of the Department, will establish university-based Homeland Security Centers of Excellence (HS-Centers), in accordance with the Homeland Security Act of 2002 that created the Department of Homeland Security, viz., to establish a coordinated, university-based system to enhance the Nations homeland security.   The purpose of these Centers is to provide a locus to attract and retain the nations best and brightest academic scholars in pursuit of homeland security related disciplines.  The HS-Centers are envisioned to be an integral and critical component of the new homeland security complex that will provide the nation with a robust, dedicated and enduring capability that will enhance our ability to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and recover from terrorist attacks.  
 
The HS-Centers will be mission-focused and targeted to research areas that leverage the multidisciplinary capabilities of universities and fill gaps in our needed knowledge and our ability to counter terrorist attacks and enhance the overall security of the nation.  The HS-Centers will complement other programs within the Department (including the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency) and in other federal agencies that fund projects-focused research aimed at the development and deployment of specific homeland security technologies and capabilities.  The selection of the HS-Centers will be coordinated with other federal agencies to minimize duplication of effort and maximize coordination of expertise and resources.
 
Call For White Papers:  
The Department intends to establish University based HS-Centers across a spectrum of short ranged and longer ranged mission-focused research and development areas. Likely areas of support include but are not limited to, risk-based economic modeling on the impact and consequence of terrorism, behavioral research on terrorism and countermeasures, public safety technology transfer, agro-terrorism countermeasures, and research and development of needed response technologies and operations.  Over the next several months, the Department will solicit additional white papers through a series of Broad Area Announcements (BAA) for a number of HS-Centers.  This initial round is soliciting white papers for the first HS-Center, to be awarded in accordance with the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by November 25, 2003. 
 
This solicitation is for a HS-Center focused on risk-based modeling, with a particular emphasis on economic aspects, to better understand the impact and consequences of terrorism and to provide decision-makers with validated tools to evaluate countermeasures and response actions.  The HS-Center will provide tools and expertise in modeling and simulation to support risk analysis, with the goal of developing predictive tools to assess vulnerabilities and potential responses to attacks to the Nations critical infrastructure.  The HS-Center will also provide policy-informed economic modeling and prediction, to identify the costs and benefits of alternate countermeasures and operation responses aimed at enhancing the security of individuals and systems.  These areas are drawn, in part, from the National Research Council Report of 2002, Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technology in Countering Terrorism located at http://www.nap.edu/books/0309084814/html/.    
 
White Paper Requirements:  
White papers should total no more than eight single spaced pages in 10pt font, including an executive summary and any attachments (all sections are required).  Section I (1 page maximum) should describe the composition and extent of participation of contributors to the proposing group, including other colleges and universities, national laboratories, industry, and state and local government.  Section II (1 page maximum) should identify and justify the advantages of citing the HS-Center in a particular region of the country and at the lead institution.  Section III (3 pages maximum) should describe the technical work plan of the lead and participant institutions; available relevant capabilities that can be applied or leveraged to meet the mission; and mechanisms for transitioning the research into operation capabilities.  Specific examples of direct relevance to homeland security should be used to validate the technical work plan.  If economic modeling, analyses and predictions is proposed as the predominant research area, then creative approaches to apply findings to the short and long term impact of attacks on national or local infrastructural assets such as energy, food and water would be an effective and compelling example. Similarly, if complex system modeling will be a focus of a Centers activities, the work plan should include specifics of how evaluative approaches will be developed to identify and marshal needed resources to respond to varying levels of attacks, either to people, infrastructure, natural resources or combinations of these. Of course, proposing groups are welcome to suggest derivative approaches and other examples in areas responsive to either or both of these interrelated identified themes.
 
Section IV (2 page maximum) of the white paper should describe the proposed management plan and organizational model for the HS-Center, and a top-level budget estimate that identifies allocation of funds across the center membership, and allocation to key activities, including management.  This section should present two options corresponding to funding levels at the $2M and $4M level per annum, for an initial three year funding cycle.
 
Submission and Evaluation of White Papers:  
White papers are to be submitted electronically and must be received by 4:00PM, Eastern Standard Time, 11 August 2003. Those planning to submit white papers can go to the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) site at http://www.orau.gov/dhsuce, for instructions, guidelines for submission procedures and details, and queries of a more substantive technical nature. The white papers will be reviewed and evaluated by a team of external independent experts.  The external expert evaluation team will provide their recommendations to the senior management of the Science & Technology Directorate.  Based on these reviews, invitations to the top candidates will be made by 6 September for full and detailed proposals.  Detailed instructions on preparation requirements will be provided at that time.  Completed proposal will be due by 1 October. A limited number of site visits will be made in early November, with an award announcement to follow shortly thereafter.  The Department of Homeland Security does not intend to make an award on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or for the use of such information.  Acknowledgment of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of the Department of Homeland Securitys evaluation of the information received. 

The white papers will be evaluated based on their ability to demonstrate:  
1.	Innovative and topic-related research directly related to advancing homeland security.
2.	Importance and effectiveness of proposed partnerships.  
3.	Established personnel and physical infrastructure that can be leveraged to successfully undertake the proposed research.

<SUBJECT>A--ACCESS 5 JOINT SPONSORED RESEARCH
<DESC>Access 5 Announcement  Special Notice.  This notice is for information and planning purposes as well as to promote competition. NASA is intending to lead a multi-agency project with the goal to enable routine, safe, and reliable operations of high altitude long endurance unmanned aerial vehicles in the national airspace system above 18,000 feet. The project objectives include developing and demonstrating technologies, and developing standards, regulations, and procedures to support such operations. Initial efforts will focus on flight above 40,000 feet, so NASA is currently seeking interested industry parties who meet the following criteria. Industry members must; Be a US owned company that is headquartered in the US and has its primary research and development or manufacturing facilities located in the US, and Have designed, built, and demonstrated an unmanned aerial vehicle that has operated above 40,000 feet with sufficient cruise range to transition multiple FAA sectors on a single flight.  NOTE:	  Since the FAA has current policy with respect to the operation of free flight balloons, Access 5 will not address issues associated with their operation. As such companies can not qualify solely on the basis of free flight balloon experience Participation criteria are expected to change as follow-on phases of the project are funded and progress permit. Project funding begins in government fiscal year 2004. Funding to support this project has currently been identified through fiscal year 2008. Initial funding is intended to begin the activity while additional funds are sought to complete the envisioned project goal.  NASA expects to conduct the project via a joint sponsored research agreement (JSRA) rather than a traditional procurement. Therefore the provisions of the Federal Acquisitions Regulations (FARs) do not apply to this announcement. The JSRA will allow industry greater participation in the project planning and implementation process. In addition the JSRA allows the negotiation of intellectual property rights. As a result industry members will;  1)	be required to, in aggregate across all industry members, contribute to the total program costs through in-kind or other cost deferral means, and 2)    not be allowed to charge profit and fee for work preformed on the project. An interested industry party may apply for membership at any time. Selection of industry members is subject to verification of their compliance with the membership criteria. Interested industry members should contact American Technologies Alliances (AmTech) stating their interest in participation and providing evidence of their qualifications against the stated criteria. AmTech is operating under a cooperative agreement  from NASA Dryden to administer JSRAs on NASAs behalf.  The initial cut off for the receipt of interest and verification of requirements will be August 15th in order to allow industry the maximum input into the project planning process. Applications by qualifying industry parties will, however, be accepted at any time. This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government pay for the information solicited.

<SUBJECT>R--SUPPORT FOR THE HUMAN GENE NOMENCLATURE COMMITTEE
<DESC>The National Library of Medicine intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University College London, Gower Street, London WC1E6BT, United Kingdom, under the authority of FAR 6.302.  University College London was awarded a contract (NO1-LM-9-3533) on September 30, 1999 to continue the maintenance and updating of a database of human gene nomenclature. The Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) at the University College London is the world's recognized authority for creating and maintaining standardized and systematic human gene names. The HGNC was founded over 24 years ago by the human gene mapping community and is recognized as the authoritative source of gene nomenclature by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO).  The purpose of the HGNC is to provide the scientific community with a unique and approved name and short-form symbol for every identified human gene, together with a description of each gene including its nucleotide sequence.  The HGNC also is responsible for coordinating gene nomenclature across species and for promoting the utilization of standardized gene nomenclature.  Due to the rapid pace of genome research the demand for new gene name assignments has seen an unanticipated increase with over 7000 new assignments being made in the past four years.  This number was nearly equivalent to the entire number of assignments made the previous 20 years.  As the cost of sequencing continues to decrease and gene identification methods improve, the number of expected gene assignments will continue to escalate.  The work of the HGNC is a critical component of human genome research world-wide since it acts as a central clearing house identifying and distinguishing genes thereby eliminating costly duplication of effort.  The standardization of gene names is absolutely essential in making the voluminous amounts of data generated by the human genome project manageable and searchable.  Genome database curation techniques rely increasingly on automated annotation and linking which have as their foundation a systematic, consistent, and hierarchical naming scheme.  Therefore, since the number of genes requiring nomenclature assignments is expected to increase and since a greater number of groups are concentrating on annotating the human genome, it becomes essential to provide a continuing high level of nomenclature support to the genome project.  The HGNC is a highly structured team of scientific experts, bioinformaticians, and editorial support personnel that have highly specialized skills not typically found in the general scientific community.  Therefore, introducing a new contractor who would have to acquire and train personnel as well as develop procedures would add materially to the time and cost of this project.  This notice of intent, therefore, is not a request for proposals.  However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  See numbered note 22.

<SUBJECT>66 -- Single Particle Soot Photometer Measurement System and Support
<DESC>In the absence of other qualified sources, it is the intent of the Meteorological Chemistry Group of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Aeronomy Laboratory (NOAA/AL) to acquire a Black Carbon Aerosol Measurement System from Droplet Measurement Technologies, Inc. (DMT) in Boulder, Colorado.    A.  BACKGROUND:  NOAA/AL has committed to measure the abundance of black-carbon-containing aerosols (commonly known as soot) in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Measurements of the number, size, and mass of aerosols containing black carbon are essential for properly characterizing the radiative balance of the atmosphere.  Soot is produced primarily in the burning of fossil fuels and biomass.  Changes in Earth's radiative balance from human activities and natural processes may lead to climate change.  NOAA/AL proposes to measure individual black carbon and other aerosol particles in internally- and externally-mixed states in the atmosphere.  In order to accomplish this goal a modified Single Particle Soot Photometer is required that can measure scattered light from individual particles in a laser beam and emitted light from single, incandescing particles that are heated by absorption of the same laser light.  By measuring incandescence at two wavelengths, particles containing black carbon can be distinguished from other absorbing and non-absorbing particles.   Sizes in the 0.1 to 2 micron diameter range will be analyzed.  B.  SCOPE:  This procurement is for a Single Particle Soot Photometer Measurement System and Instrument Technical Support.  C.  PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:  The measurement system will be delivered by November 1, 2003.  After receipt of the system the Contractor shall provide up to 120 hours of instrument related technical support during the following twelve-month period.   D.  SOLE SOURCE:  NOAA has determined that only Droplet Measurement Technologies, Inc. (DMT, Inc.) of Boulder, Colorado has a Single Particle Soot Photometer that can meet the following required performance and delivery specifications for a black-carbon aerosol instrument:  1) DETECTION OF SINGLE PARTICLES CONTAINING ELEMENTAL BLACK (GRAPHITE AND AMORPHOUS) CARBON WITH SIZES BETWEEN 0.1 and 2 MICRON DIAMETER AND AT NUMBER CONCENTRATIONS IN AN AMBIENT SAMPLE UP TO 5000 PER CUBIC CENTIMETER.  Carbon-containing particles must be distinguished in an ambient air sample from other particles containing other chemical components such as ammonium sulfate, sodium chloride and organics.  Detection occurs in a jet of ambient air containing the particles. The Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP-2) from DMT, Inc. can detect single particles containing elemental black (graphite and amorphous) carbon with sizes between 0.1 and 2 micron diameter and at number concentrations in an ambient sample up to 5000 per cubic centimeter.  Ground-based tests with atmospheric samples have been conducted in urban settings to show the basic performance of the system.  The detector, called a laser-induced incandescence photometer for atmospheric black carbon, uses the principle that light-absorbing particles will heat to incandescence when illuminated with high-intensity light (US Patent # 5920388 (July 6, 1999)).  The incandescence temperature, as determined by two- or three-wavelength pyrometry, identifies carbon when it is a principal component of the particle.  The photometer utilizes a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser (1.06 m wavelength) for particle heating and four optical detectors with filter elements arrayed around an aerosol jet for monitoring particle light scattering and incandescence.  The time-resolved signals from each of the detectors are digitized and stored for analysis for individual particles.  The detectors are selected for broadband and narrowband incandescence and infrared scattered laser light. The scattered light signal in the SP-2 nominally provides particle size information.  When a particle is heated to incandescence, the scattered light no longer provides accurate particle size information.  The signal from the broadband detector can instead be used to size the particle.  For black carbon particles sampled in a laboratory instrument, the signal positively correlates with the particle size.  The ratio of the two incandescence sensor signals can be used to determine the temperature of the particle and the temperature can be used to determine the composition of the particle.  The number of particle types that incandesce in a laser cavity depends strongly on laser power and wavelength.  Extensive tests have been performed at DMT to categorize the types of particles that can incandesce in the SP-2 configuration.  Only a few metal particles aside from black carbon have been found to incandesce in the instrument. 2) COMPLETE DATA PROCESSING AND STORAGE OF SINGLE-PARTICLE AVENTS USING SELECTED SIGNAL-PROCESSING HARDWARE AND CUSTOMIZED SOFTWARE.  The full response from each detector must be recorded for later analysis for each particle event up to a few hundred-particle events per second.  The software must also handle acquisition of instrument status data and provide some real-time analysis of the acquired data. The SP-2 software consists of three programs: the data acquisition program, which has three components, and two post-acquisition analysis and review tools.  The main data acquisition module acquires particle spectra at rates up to 5000 events/second with a 28% duty cycle, and is able to achieve a 100% duty cycle for particle rates below a few hundred per second.  Since the four digitizer channels each sample at 5 MS/sec, a 100% duty cycle corresponds to continuously streaming 40MBytes/sec of data, scanning it for randomly-occurring events, and saving the events to disk.  The two other data acquisition modules handle acquisition of housekeeping/instrument health data and provide real-time analysis of the acquired data.  The post-acquisition analysis tools extract numerous parameters from the spectra and categorize each spectra into particle size and type bins.  The SP-2 software has been highly tuned and customized for this application and has been thoroughly tested.  There is currently no other software available that can operate the SP-2 instrument at the same performance level. 3) DEMONSTRATED SUITABILITY OF THE PARTICLE DETECTION AND DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEMS FOR OPERATION ON AN AIRCRAFT PLATFORM.  The instrument systems must be able to function in the variable temperature, pressure, and vibration environment of an operating aircraft.  The basic detection system must be able to connect to an external inlet to acquire particles from outside the aircraft.  Maximum weight of the particle detection instrument must be less than 40 kg, excluding the sample pump and data system. The SP-2 was demonstrated on board the NASA DC-8 aircraft during a 6-week mission in early 2003 involving measurements in the Arctic troposphere and lower stratosphere.  The SP-2 prototype instrument successfully detected particles on several of the mission flights.  The weight of the SP-2 was less than 40 kg, excluding the sample pump and data system.  4) PROVIDE DELIVERY OF A COMPLETE BLACK-CARBON AEROSOL MEASUREMENT SYSTEM AND SUPPORT COMPONENTS.   The aerosol measurement system is being developed to participate in an airborne mission in mid-2004.  The time required for preparation of the system for flight and integration of the instrument on board the aircraft require that the basic instrument be received by November 1, 2003.  DMT, Inc. can meet this schedule.  E.  Conclusion:  DMT, Inc. is therefore uniquely qualified to carry out this effort.  This notice may represent the only notice.  See note 22.

<DESC>This announcement constitutes a pre-solicitation synopsis.  The Air Force intends to award an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to  acquire two years requirements for a non-developmental (i.e. currently in  production) precision targeting system, specifically the Litening Targeting Pod  System (LTPS), to be integrated in F-16, F-15, A-10, and B-52 aircraft  possessed by the Active Duty Air Force, United States Air Force Reserve Command  (AFRC) and the Air National Guard (ANG).  The Precision Attack System Program  Office (PASPO) contemplates using a single, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite  Quantity (ID/IQ) contract approach for the USAF acquisition and sustainment  requirements of the Litening Targeting Pod System (LTPS), which includes  Litening II, Litening ER, Litening AT and future Litening variants.  The  contract may include activities such as production of additional LTPS pods,  required support equipment, spares and product support to include, but not  limited to, field and depot level support, sustaining engineering, software  support, technical data, aircrew and maintenance training, initial spares,  provisioning and support equipment, flight test support, Interim Contractor  Support (ICS), Contractor Logistics Support (CLS), special studies, effort in  support of contingency operations and contractor field team support (CFT) to  include emergency fleet repair supports; as well as integration, test and  production and installation of future modifications and enhancements to the  LTPS.  The Contractor shall be responsible for all actions necessary to meet  USAF, AFRC and ANG requirements and ensure system and subsystem integration to  include configuration control, mitigation of parts obsolescence, total system  performance and future modifications, upgrades, and enhancements.  The ID/IQ  contract will be used for ordering and is intended to cover those types of  supplies/services which have historically been acquired sole source from the  OEM, Northrop Grumman Corporation, Rolling Meadows, IL, and future Litening  requirements for which the Government would solicit and negotiate with Northrop  Grumman Corporation on a sole source basis as authorized by FAR part 6.  The  estimated amount for the acquisition is $48M based on a two-year ordering  period and a five-year period of performance.  Contract efforts are subject to  FAR 52.232-28 availability of funds.  Anticipated award date for the basic  ID/IQ contract is Nov 03.  Contact Susanne Adams at (410) 765-8269 at Northrop  Grumman Corporation for subcontracting opportunities.

<DESC>This notice is a combined synopsis/solicitation Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this solicitation is NOI-RML #30010.  The solicitation documents and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2001-14 dated 05/30/03. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a Small Business Set-Aside.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 and the small business size is 500.  SCHEDULE:  The Rocky Mountain Laboratories, (RML), Laboratory of Human Bacterial Pathogenesis (LHBP) performs research on multiple, diverse human bacterial pathogens and the host/bacterial response during infection. The LHBP has purchased a custom designed, multi-genome GeneChip probe array specific to RML needs, containing the following bacterial genomes: Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia pestis, Borrelia burgdorferi and Coxiella burnettii and Chlamydia trachomatis.  This chip is unique and specific to RML.  No other chip of its kind exists. The RML custom chip contains twenty-one (21) different bacterial genomes condensed into six (6) different genuses of pathogenic bacteria. These gene chips will be used in RML experiments to analyze the bacterial response during host infection. The LHBP intends to purchase 3 lots of custom probe arrays, at 90 chips per lot, from Affymetrix. The design and manufacturing process of this custom gene chip is wholly patented and owned by Affymetrix. The chip is high density.  (USPNos. 5445934 and 5744305).  The custom GeneChip was made by photolithography manufacturing technology (USPNos. 5424186, 5510270), developed solely by Affymetrix.  The multi-genome GeneChip probe array must enable identification of   2-fold or greater levels of change in expression levels, and detection of as little as 1 mRNA transcript in a complex mixture of 100,000.  The GeneChip probe array must contain multiple unique probes designed to be Perfect Match (PM), 25-mer oligonucleotide probe pairs, to represent each mRNA transcript (full length gene) tested, and multiple probes designed to be Mis-Match (MM), to enable calibration of non-specific hybridization data (USPNos.5527681). Additional control sequences (yeast and commensal) must also be available on the chip for hybridization control, and housekeeping gene analysis.  The probe selection strategy for the multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array was based upon a probe design database (USPNos. 6188783) and was able to distinguish between highly homologous sequences and those of closely related gene families, strains, species and genus of bacteria. The multi-genome custom GeneChip probe array is  housed in a fixed volume reaction chamber (USPNos. 5945334, 6140044) providing automated and consistent hybridization of samples to the array. The chips processed by NIAID are in  Frederick, MD where the Affymetrix GeneArray Scanner, Fluidics Station, 640 Hybridization Oven, Micro Array Suite/Data Mining Tool (USPNos. 5871928, 6040138, 6197506), MicroDB, and LIMS software database are located. No other photolithography-based chip, apart from those purchased from Affymetrix  is compatible with the Affymetrix system currently in place in Frederick, MD.  In addition, there is no photolithography-based chip processing system on site at RML.    FOB Point shall be Destination, Hamilton, MT.  Inside delivery shall be 60 days after receipt of order (ARO).  Delivery location is Rocky Mountain Laboratories, 903 S. 4th Street, Hamilton, MT.  The following FAR provisions and clauses apply to this acquisition: 52.212-1 Instructions to OfferorsCommercial; FAR 52.212-2 EvaluationCommercial Items; FAR 52-212-4 Contract Terms and ConditionsCommercial Items; FAR 52-212.5 Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive OrdersCommercial Items; FAR 52.246-2 Inspection of Supplies-Fixed Price.
