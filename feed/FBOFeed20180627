<DESC>Sole Source FBO Notice for Procurement Request 0000HCCC-2018-23655<br />Title: Development and Demonstrations of Data Analytics Strategies for<br />Evaluating Organizational Safety Performance<br />The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Biostatistics and Epidemiology Branch, Health Effects Laboratory Division, Morgantown, WV intends to award a sole source firm fixed price purchase order to Appalachian State University, 1039 Stare Farm Road, Boone, NC 28607-4956 for the expert knowledge and technical services needed for assisting NIOSH researchers in conducting a research study of "big" data mining and data analytics strategies applied to assessments of large organizational data sets for safety behavior and performance obtained from at least two manufacturing and/or construction organizations with three option years. <br />Statement of Work<br />Development and Demonstrations of Data Analytics Strategies<br />For Evaluating Organizational Safety Performance
<p>A. Background Information</p>
<p>Safety and health programs within these industry sectors have made great strides in reducing the number of work-related injuries and fatalities, but the ability to prevent future injuries could be further improved by developing and implementing novel approaches for collecting, analyzing, and managing organizational data. The services provided with this contract will assist safety researchers in the Health Effects Laboratory Division (HELD) of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in Morgantown, West Virginia in conducting a research study on data analytics strategies for evaluating organizational safety performance. The project entails conducting at least two case studies with manufacturing and/or construction companies (hereafter, Company A and Company B) in which a strategic application of data mining and analytics techniques is planned and implemented to evaluate each company's safety performance. Unlike traditional approaches that tend to focus on lagging safety indicators (e.g., number of OSHA recordable, first aids, near misses), the purpose of this project will be to describe a comprehensive data collection and analysis strategy that integrates multiple organizational data sources and metrics to reveal potentially important insights associated with leading safety indicators (e.g., safety-related behaviors, procedures, processes, decision-making, etc.). The project's specific aims are:</p>
<p>&bull; Develop and implement an Analytics Readiness Audit for Company A and Company B that will evaluate each company's safety and health program including (a) their data collection, storage, and sharing methods, (b) data quality, and (c) safety performance and management systems, and (d) safety climate/culture. <br />&bull; Develop data collection systems and sources, and prepare data sets by aggregating, cleaning, and formatting the relevant safety, injury, illness, production schedule, supply chain, human resources, and market and economic data.<br />&bull; Conduct a four-phase analytics process that may consist of descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics to identify patterns in the data and develop models to help prevent future injuries. <br />&bull; Develop industry-specific and more general guidance documents that will be published in the occupational safety literature that will describe the analytics processes that were conducted to increase the likelihood of the adoption of these techniques within and across industry sectors.</p>
<p>B. Objectives</p>
<p>The objective of this contract is to obtain expert knowledge and technical services needed for conducting data analyses using "big" data mining and data analytics strategies, and for applying these methods and techniques to large organizational data sets obtained from at least two manufacturing and/or construction organizations (Company A and Company B).</p>
<p>C. Services to be provided</p>
<p>Independently, and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, materials, equipment and facilities, needed to perform the Statement of Work below:</p>
<p>Year 1<br />1. Develop (in consultation with NIOSH personnel) a written proposal for conducting a Analytics Readiness Audit-an evaluation of each company's safety and health program including (a) their data collection, storage, and sharing methods, (b) data quality, and (c) safety performance and management systems, and (d) safety climate/culture <br />3. Conduct an Analytics Readiness Audit for each company<br /><br />Year 2 (option year) if funds are available<br />1. For each company, complete a written report of findings resulting from the Analytics Readiness Audit <br />2. For each company, prepare data sets as needed for analytics by aggregating, cleaning, and formatting the relevant safety, injury, illness, production schedule, supply chain, human resources, and market and economic data</p>
<p>Year 3 (option year) if funds are available<br />1. For each company and in consultation with NIOSH personnel, develop of written multi-phase analytics proposal consisting of one or more of the different types of descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and/or prescriptive analytics to identify patterns in the data and develop models to help prevent future injuries<br />2. Implement the multi-phase analytics process with each company</p>
<p>Year 4 (option year) if funds are available <br />1. In collaboration with NIOSH personnel, develop a final written report for each company describing the results of the Analytics Readiness Audit, description of and modifications to the data sources and data structures, all analytics strategies implemented and their results, interpretation of the findings, and recommendations for program improvements in a format suitable for publication the occupational safety literature.<br />2. On the basis of the successes (or failures) in conducting each case study, and in consultation and collaboration with NIOSH personnel, develop a written manuscript suitable for publication as an industry specific or a general guidance document describing promising practices and strategies for applying analytics techniques to organizational safety data.</p>

Explanation for how the agency intends to use the product or service in terms of function to be performed:<br />As part of cellular therapy manufacturing and red cell genomics services, the DTM/CPS also offers core research support, including new research technologies to measure cellular safety, purity, potency and consistency and for red cell genotyping. Traditional assays which are based on flow cytometry and serology only provide superficial information about cell quality and red cell phenotype prior to infusion. Hence improved methods are needed to perform additional analysis prior to using these expensive experimental therapies in humans. The 10x genomics single cell separator provides a simple, sophisticated, and sensitive method of identifying ane separating single cells for high resolution analysis for research and clinical characterization. <br />3. Performance requirement or essential physical characteristics. <br />In order to operate at optimal levels and incorporate novel research technologies for clinical use, the following attributes of the 10x single cell seperator are critical for high resolution cell characterization. Generate single-cell transcript counts from up to 100,000 cells per run. Produce &gt;90,000 individual nanoliter-scale partitions leveraging ~750,000 unique 16 bp Barcodes, Capture cells at high efficiency up to 65%, Low doublet rate 0.9% per 1,000 cells, Achieve deep profiling of complex cell populations with high-throughput digital gene expression of individual cells, Provide stand-alone, turn-key analysis pipelines and visualization software for novice and expert users alike, Include a microfluidics chip that is compatible with a wide range of eukaryotic cell sizes, and types (e.g. adherent cell cultures, suspension cell cultures, tissues, blood, etc.), Rapid time to lysis facilitates an accurate view of the transcriptome with minimal impact on gene expression.</p>
<p>Shipments will use government carrier at the expense of the government unless otherwise arranged.<br />The contractor shall bear the cost of replacement for reagents and disposables found to be damaged or defective upon receipt by NIH or for incorrect or incomplete shipments.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address</strong>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E126, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institute of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) plans to procure on a sole source basis services to investigate radiation induced gene expression changes in heart, lungs and liver samples of mini pig model after exposed to whole body irradiation from GenUs BioSystems at 1808 Janke Drive, Unit M, Northbrook, IL 60062.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-1(b)(1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6. The North American Industry Classification System code is 541380 and the business size standard is $15.0 Million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>The Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) exists to plan and conduct pre-clinical and clinical research on the biologic and therapeutic effects of radiation administrated alone or in combination with other modalities of treatment; to develop novel technology and imaging based approaches for radiation oncology; to investigate the natural history of disease to understand and evaluate means of diagnostic assessment for the purpose of optimizing treatment selections; and to provide radiation therapy as well as general oncology consultations for patients admitted to other Clinical Research Center (CRC) clinical services, in a collaborative approach.</p>
<p>Total RNA isolated from 72 organ samples provided by the NCI from mini pigs after whole body irradiation will be used for this study. To obtain a global assessment of changes that occur in these samples in response to radiation, mRNA expression profiles will be analyzed by the Contractor. Data analysis will include a pathway analysis to identify differences in expression of mRNAs that are relevant for each radiation dose.</p>
<p>The core strength and sole focus of the Contractor shall be expression profiling on microarrays. The Contractor shall provide gene expression profiling: consisting of amplification of RNA, hybridization to microarrays, and data. The purpose of this requirement is to provide full service gene expression analysis using unique and proprietary protocols and systems developed to provide highly sensitive and reproducible Gene Expression results for Total RNA starting quantities of as little as 50 picograms.</p>
<p>The Contractor shall offer three tiers of processing various quantities of Total RNA. The first tier involves a single round of amplification (standard procedure, established in FDA-sponsored MAQC study, 2006) to generate labeled material to hybridize to the microarray platform. This first tier of processing can work with as little as 20 ng of Total RNA sample. The second tier of processing utilizes a double amplification process and generates enough labeled material to run multiple technical replicates for each sample. The Contractor shall routinely work with less than 1.0 nanogram of starting material with this method, and can go down to 50 picograms of Total RNA with the NCI third tier of amplification methods. Protocol shall consist of established processes such as sample recovery, sample handling and preparation, utilization of various reagents and enzymatic reactions, application of samples to the microarray, post-treatment of the array, scanning and image capture, and statistical analysis of the data.</p>
<p>The NCI has already performed a biomarker signature study using whole blood collected from a mini pig model after whole body irradiation. For this study, the NCI is using organs which were provided as part of a collaborative study. These organs were collected after sacrificing the animal after whole body irradiation. The mini pigs are a small sized breed of pig called Gottingen mini pig.</p>
<p>Extensive qualification and quantification processes ensure high caliber results. The entire procedure requires a sophisticated laboratory with highly-skilled laboratory technicians to carry out the multiple parts of the experiment. Highly specific mRNA expression arrays shall be used by the Contractor as were used in the previous studies for the mouse organ samples and minipig blood samples. By using the same platform, microarray analysis will allow the NCI to compare previous data from the whole blood analysis. Due to variability and limited size of samples, the ability to generate consistent results from difficult sample conditions is a requirement. In addition, in order to be able to expand and complete the ongoing research using these treatments, the micro-array analysis must be compatible with previous experiments processed by the Contractor for the NCI. Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to current gene expression studies performed in the aforementioned by the NCI laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>The following qualifications are required:</strong></p>
<p>&bull;The Contractor shall provide highly sensitive and reproducible results of gene expression studies for total RNA starting quantities of as little as 50 picograms. <br />&bull;The Contractor shall provide unlimited up-front consulting to determine the best experimental design and sample handling for the upcoming study prior to submitting samples. <br />&bull;The Contractor shall be able to provide processes such as sample recovery, sample handling and preparation, utilization of various reagents and enzymatic reactions, application of samples to the microarray, post-treatment of the array, scanning and image capture, and statistical analysis of the data. <br />&bull;The Contractor shall provide the NCI with a comprehensive data analysis and be willing to give support for exclusive and unlimited data analysis and consulting.<br />&bull;The Contractor shall be able to generate consistent results from difficult sample conditions (variability and limited sample size). <br />&bull;The Contractor shall be able to expand and complete the ongoing analysis using these treatments. The microarray analysis must be compatible with previous experiments.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>
<p>The NCI will ship the RNA samples within one (1) week after the approval of the purchase order and the Contractor shall complete the following tasks:</p>
<p>&bull;The Contractor shall assess the quality of these 72 RNA samples. <br />&bull;The Contractor shall notify the Project Coordinator, of the results by providing pictures of the gel and graphs.<br />&bull;The Contractor shall amplify the RNA using in vitro transcription and again assess the quality of the cDNA before the actual labeling of the chips. <br />&bull;The Contractor shall perform data analysis once the experimental procedure is completed. <br />&bull;The Contractor shall then perform the final statistical analysis and send the data to the Project Coordinator.<br />&bull;The Contractor shall offer full services for Agilent gene expression microarrays which will allow seamless merging of previous data from multiple experiments.<br />&bull;The Contractor shall use Agilent's 60-mer Sure Print technology, coupled probe design, high density arrays with multiple replicated probes, and special labeling methods for optimal sensitivity and specificity similar to that found only on Agilent's whole genome expression and miRNA microarrays.<br />&bull;The Contractor shall use Gene Spring analysis software from Agilent for data analysis allowing for the comparison of past, current, and future experiments conducted by the Contractor.</p>
<p>The statistical analysis shall consist of the following data:</p>
<p>-Master list with both up and down regulated genes with fold change and p value<br />-Gene Ontology classifications<br />-Venn diagrams of different combinations<br />-Heat maps of the NCI's interest in CDs shipped via FedEx using the NCI's FedEx account.</p>
<p>The length of the experimental process and discussions shall be two (2) to three (3) weeks. This will lead to the acceptance of the analysis criteria by the NCI Project Coordinator. The aforementioned data shall be shared with the NCI electronically.</p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong></p>
<p>The period of performance shall be for twelve (12) months from date of award. Sample processing and microarray hybridization process will start as soon as the NCI ships the samples to the Contractor. The final data analysis and the data in the final format shall be shipped to the NCI Project Coordinator.</p>

<DESC>This is a synopsis of an intended Repair Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) with Raytheon Company (96214) and serves as the pre-solicitation synopsis notice for all repair orders issued by the NAVSUP WSS for the period a five-year period estimated from January 25, 2019 to January 25, 2024 for the evaluation and repair of various repair components of the Navy Weapons System manufactured and repair. This intended BOA covers the repair of the APY-10 Radar System in support of the P-8 Aircraft. The items are specified within the attached document as listed below.<br />
<p>None of the items under this acquisition are subject to the Trade Agreements Act (TAA), but rather, the entire balance is subject to the Buy American Act (BAA), which requires delivery of end products of specified countries or as otherwise consistent with the governing statute and implementing regulations. The applicable BAA and TAA clauses and certificates will be included in the solicitation and contract. Other potentially applicable clauses and certificates, for example those governing specialty metals, commercial derivative military articles, and the prohibition against acquiring munitions list items from Communist China military companies, will also be included.

<p>Orders issued under the Basic Ordering Agreement and pursuant to this synopsis will be issued pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). The items contemplated for procurement of repair require Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source previously approved by the government for repair of these items will be solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit the information detailed in the NAVSUP WSS (Philadelphia) Source Approval Information Brochure for Repair. This brochure identifies technical data required to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made.

<p>Project Description:  (Approx. quantities)</p>
<p>Construct a replacement irrigation diversion weir across the Lower Yellowstone River and fish bypass channel through Joe's Island.  The weir consists of a steel W-pile section foundation with reinforced concrete crest structure capping it, and will be upstream of an existing wooden weir constructed in 1911-1912, with riprap placed between the weirs.  Ninety-four W-pile sections are driven to a depth of approximately 37 feet. The weir length is approximately 700 linear feet and amount of formed reinforced concrete is approximately 500 cubic yards. The construction requires the use of sheet pile coffering and constructed in segments in order to not block the entire river.</p>
<p>Bypass channel will be approximately 2.2 miles long with ~75-foot bottom width, ~200-foot top width, ~18 feet average excavation depth with varying side slopes.  The channel side slopes will be protected with a layer of riprap on bends, the invert and side slopes protected with cobbles processed from the excavation, and the entrance and exit and two locations within the channel protected with riprap structures.  The channel excavation requires intense dewatering system to be designed by the Contractor, and earthen cofferdams at the channel entrance and exit.</p>
<p>Approximate quantities are as follows: ~980,000 CY of excavation, ~99,000 Tons of quarried riprap, and ~34,000 CY of cobbles for invert protection.  Most of the excavation will be wasted on Joe's Island in an existing natural high-flow channel for a length of ~9000 feet.</p>
<p>Project will also require seeding and planting of trees and resurfacing an access road for approximately 6000 linear feet.  Relocation of a historic wooden cableway tower and a building to new locations, and removal and coiling of cable that spans the river.  The work scheduling will be affected by irrigation and fish passage dates.</p>
<p>The estimated construction cost of this project is between	$40,000,000 and $50,000,000.<br />_______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>The Contractor will be required to commence work within 10 days after notice to proceed and complete the work 900 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed.  Provisions will be included for liquidated damages in case of failure to complete the work in the time allowed.  Performance and payment bonds will be required.

<DESC><p>Coherent 2D-IR spectrometer, utilizing NIST-supplied mid-IR laser pulses (&gt;100 cm-1 FWHM bandwidth, tunable from 3700 cm-1 to 1000 cm-1). The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing turn-key systems composed of an IR pulse sequencer, sample holder, IR detector, and control software. NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 1,000 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice. Note that 13 CFR &sect; 125.6 is applicable to this procurement, and as such, would need to comply with the limitations on subcontracting or qualify as a non-manufacturer (see https://www.sba.gov/contracting/contracting-officials/non-manufacturer-rule/non-manufacturer-waivers). If a small business cannot meet the requirements of 13 CFR &sect; 125.6 in response to the below requirements, it should indicate so in its response. <br />The Material Science and Engineering Division maintains a state-of-the-art facility for non-linear optical characterization of soft-materials. The facility is centered around a 3 kHz repetition rate, ultrafast laser system, capable of providing tunable laser pulses with duration ranging from 3 ps to 8 fs and center wavelength ranging from 0.25 to 12 micrometre. The facility currently focuses on both vibrationally resonant sum-frequency generation (SFG) and coherent, 2D visible spectroscopy. This procurement is to extend the capabilities of the facility with a coherent 2D-IR spectrometer, utilizing NIST-supplied mid-IR laser pulses (&gt;100 cm-1 FWHM bandwidth, tunable from 3700 cm-1 to 1000 cm-1).</p>
<p>Coherent 2D-IR spectroscopy requires a minimum of 3, precisely timed, laser pulses to be incident on the sample: a pump pair, separated by time t, and a probe, separated from the pump-pair by time t. Often a fourth, reference pulse is employed for heterodyne detection of the probe. A complete spectrometer consists of an IR pulse sequencer, sample holder, IR detector, and control software.</p>
<p>Coherent 2D-IR can be performed in multiple configurations, including fully-noncolinear (&lsquo;4 in a box'), noncolinear pump-probe, and fully-colinear pump-probe (self-heterodyned). The spectrometer must support at least one of the three modes. To assure rapid data collection, the spectrometer must implement frequency domain, heterodyne (either of self- or reference) detection. The system must support facile generation of all phase sequences necessary for artifact rejection. The system must be able to acquire single pulse response at the 3 kHz repetition rate of the IR source.</p>
<p>Potential vendors are asked to comment as to their ability to meet or exceed the specifications outlined below. Values listed in parenthesis represent currently expected minimum specifications; however, this list may be modified and/or expanded should a formal procurement be pursued. <br />Specifications:<br />2D IR spectrometer consisting of the following:</p>
<p>IR pulse sequencer<br />&bull; Spectral coverage: (2.6 to 10)&nbsp;micrometre via 3 grating sets<br />&bull; Spectral resolution: better than 5 cm-1 at 5.5 &#61549;micrometre<br />&bull; Maximum double pulse delay (t) greater than 5 ps at 5.5 micrometre<br />&bull; Double pulse delay resolution less than 50 fs<br />&bull; Maximum probe pulse delay (&#61556;) greater than 10 ps<br />&bull; Probe pulse delay resolution less than 50 fs<br /><br />IR detector/spectrometer<br />&bull; LN2 cooled 2D MCT array<br />&bull; Dewar Minimum hold time of 8 to 10 hrs<br />&bull; Spectral coverage: (2. to 10.5) micrometre<br />&bull; Spectral resolution: better than 1 cm-1 /pixel at 5.5 micrometre<br />&bull; Two gratings for high (75 l/mm) and low (30 l/mm) resolution operation.<br />&bull; Minimum number of pixels: 128x128<br />&bull; Minimum number of bits resolution: 14<br /><br />System optics<br />&bull; All optics necessary for<br />o generation of IR pulse sequence<br />o recombination at sample<br />o transport to spectrometer/detector<br />shall be provided in an integrated, enclosed, purgeable housing with an overall footprint not to exceed 24"x55"<br />&bull; Optics will include appropriate attenuation for pump, probe and reference beams.</p>
<p>System performance<br />&bull; Single-shot probe and reference spectrum acquisition at 3 kHz<br />&bull; Pump pulse pair cycling at 3 kHz<br />&bull; Vendor-provided phase cycling schemes for scatter-free data collection in the implemented geometry.<br /><br />Control electronics and software<br />&bull; The system shall be completely controlled by vendor provided software. Bug-fixes and updates will be provided at no cost for 1 years after installation. <br />&bull; Software will allow independent operation of shaper for &lsquo;external' experiments (2D-SFG). <br />&bull; Vendor will provide a control computer, monitor, keyboard and mouse compatible with system hardware.</p>
<p>Electrical<br />&bull; Each powered component will operate on less than 15A/120 VAC. <br />&bull; Total electrical load of the system (spectrometer, including camera, chiller, computer, etc.) not to exceed 45A at 120 VAC.</p>
<p>Instruction to Responders: <br />Companies that are capable of providing this 2D-IR spectrometer are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to Wendy.Paulo@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. <br />Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:<br />1. Name of the company(s) that offer the required supply. In addition, provide a point of contact for the company(s).<br />2. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery.<br />3. Rough estimate of pricing (if available, not required); and<br />4.

To satisfy this requirement, the vendor shall provide the original documentation from the manufacturer stating they are an authorized dealer/distributor for the items being procured. This letter shall be on the manufacturers  official letter head or from an official manufacturer  email and guarantees the products are safe, are not counterfeit or adulterated devices, have maintained adequate storage conditions, and that:

All product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or 
Guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the vendor to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment. 

An EXAMPLE of an acceptable OEM Authorized Dealer letter is attached (SEE ATTACHMENT 1). 

LIMITATIONS ON SUBCONTRACTING AND THE NON-MANUFACTURER RULE (NMR)

The requirement that a non-manufacturer supply the product of a small business concern is referred to
as the Non-Manufacturer Rule (NMR) [13 C.F.R.  121.406]. In order to qualify as a small business
concern for a small business set-aside, an offeror must either manufacture the item in accordance with
the Limitations on Subcontracting (see FAR section 52.219-14, 52.219-27 and 13 C.F.R.  125.6) or
supply the product of a small business made in the United States.

<DESC>Synopsis: <br /><br />Announcement.<br /><br />The U.S. Army Network-Cross Functional Team, with Program Executive Office C3T, will host a tactical network related forum to discuss needs for distributed computing (mission command) solutions, including the potential to deliver Cloud services to tactical formations. This Technical Industry Forum will take place from August 1-2, 2018 in Raleigh, North Carolina at the Marriott Raleigh City Center. All persons who wish to attend this forum must register no later than 5:00p.m. (EST) July 20, 2018. Registration is available at this link: <br /><br />https://armytacticalcloudindustryday.eventbrite.com<br /><br />The goal of the event is to assist industry partners and interested government organizations in identifying and aligning their efforts with Army tactical network modernization priorities. This event is meant for a technical audience to include Cloud service providers, systems and software engineers, architecture experts, data analytical experts and integrators. The Army encourages non-defense IT companies to participate in this two day forum, as these companies may have innovative solutions to enable: data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, block chain, multi-level security, identity and access management and storage and delivery across Army tactical formations operating in a disconnected, intermitted and limited bandwidth (DIL) environment. <br /><br />The first day will provide an introduction to Army hierarchy and decision making structures in order to enable technical audience members to understand the physical and network environments in which the Army operates. Technical panels will then discuss Army network implementation, management, and constraints in four distributed computing (mission command) related areas: 1. Data Logistics; 2. Infrastructure; 3. Enterprise Service Architecture; 4. Mission Partner Environment. <br />The second day will offer an opportunity for conversation and technical exchange between audience members and Army network technical experts and user community representatives. This day will reseat panel members who will be prepared for conversation exchange on each topic area addressed on day one. This will enable vendors, in an open session, to ask questions for clarification, operational understanding (uniformed operators will be present) and technical understanding. Each topical session will have a moderated panel and will field questions from attendees regarding that topic. At the end of the event, for those interested, the Army will host a &lsquo;doing business with the Army' session for those vendors who would like to understand how to respond to Army solicitations, work with Small Business Offices and explore types of Army contracts that might be employed to seek capability. This session is optional. This information is intended to help scope follow-on white papers and demonstrations resulting from this technical forum. <br /><br /><br />Problem Statement: <br /><br />The U.S. Army seeks to leverage Cloud capabilities within the tactical ecosystem. This tactical compute Cloud will be constrained by a variety of factors that fall into the following categories: Data Logistics, Infrastructure, Enterprise Service Architecture, and Mission Partner Environment. Each of these areas is affected by the operational environment including contested and congested environments, low bandwidth, spectrum denied, and many other factors that preclude traditional cloud solutions. The US Army is seeking capability ideas in the above categories that will meet the needs of the operating force.<br /><br /><br />DRAFT AGENDA: Dress code for both days: Military: Duty Uniform; Civilian: business casual<br /><br />DAY 1<br /><br />0700-0800: Registration/Breakfast <br /><br />0800-0810: Opening remarks<br /><br />0810-0830: Remarks MG Pete Gallagher<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Director, Network CFT <br /><br />0830-0850: Remarks MG Dave Bassett<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PEO C3T<br /><br />0850-0950: "Army 101": Operational Structure Mr. Erik Hanson<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. John Bender<br />Description: Overview of the Army's structure, units, and operating methods. <br /><br />0950-1005: Break<br /><br />1005-1100: "Army 201": The Network Mr. Erik Hanson <br />Description: Overview of the Army's networks and how they relate to the Operational Structure, challenges relating to the network, and what cloud related problems we are asking industry to solve.<br /><br />1100-1130: UPDATE: Mission Command Software Development Kit Mr. Krupal Kapadia, Chief Engineer, product manager Tactical Mission Command <br /><br />1130-1230: LUNCH<br /><br />1230-1330: Topic 1 Panel: Data Logistics <br />Description: Soldiers &amp; Sensors generate mass quantities of data that must be aggregated for analysis at higher echelons; the outcome of which must be transferred as actionable intelligence to the edge of the battlefield.<br /><br />1330-1430: Topic 2 Panel: Infrastructure <br />Description: Army Units are not aligned on a single baseline - often requiring units to integrate legacy technology into advantaged environments.

<CONTACT>Brian D Serra, Agreements Officer, Phone 407-208-3357, Email brian.d.serra.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Request for Solutions:<br />Air Defense Artillery Long-Term Evolution Orientation Device<br /><br />1. Purpose<br /></strong>This Request for Solutions is issued to identify a unique solution for an Air Defense Artillery Long-Term Evolution Orientation Device. The Government will evaluate the solutions with the intent of negotiating an Other Transaction Agreement under the Training and Readiness Accelerator (TReX).<br /><br /><strong>2. Summary and Background<br /></strong>The U.S. Army desires a Long-Term Evolution (LTE)-based device to provide real-time orientation and positioning status to support air defense simulated engagements during live force-on-force training exercises.<br /><br />Currently, Army Combat Training Centers (CTC) use laser based systems to replicate direct fire engagements. Laser based systems have limitations when targets do not have the ability to utilize Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System (MILES) detectors, such as United States Airforce (USAF) aircraft, Army aviation helicopters or Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) platforms. Many of the Air Defense Artillery (ADA) engagements (such as missiles) can be stimulated if both the target location and a reasonable weapon orientation at the time of engagement is known. Two CTCs (the National Training Center (NTC) and Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC)) have or soon will have an LTE-based instrumentation network. The LTE network will allow the integration of commercial items, such as devices that provide orientation. This project will develop (if possible and reasonable) a prototype providing a weapon orientation device that will communicate across the existing CTC LTE network. This device will enhance pilot, ADA and Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) training at the CTCs.<br /><br />The Combat Training Center Instrumentation System (CTC-IS) Program fielded capabilities for the CTCs at the NTC at Fort Irwin, California; the JRTC at Fort Polk, Louisiana. CTC-IS is an integrated system of computer software and hardware; workstations; databases; voice, video, and data recording, production, and presentation equipment; interface devices; and communication networks. It provides the tools for the Combat Trainer and the Training Analysts to collect, analyze, and present training performance feedback to the training unit in the After Action Review.<br /><br /><strong>The full RFS and Technical Supplement can be viewed on the TReX website, located at the following link: <a href="https://trainingaccelerator.org/2018/03/air-defense-artillery-long-term-evolution-orientation-device/">https://trainingaccelerator.org/2018/03/air-defense-artillery-long-term-evolution-orientation-device/</a> </strong><a href="https://trainingaccelerator.org/system-of-systems-controlled-environment-test-infrastructure-sceti/"></a></p>

The US Customs and Border Protection, Border Enforcement Contracting Division, Pacific Branch, under the authority of FAR 6.302, has awarded Delivery Order 70B03C18F00000441, effective June 18, 2018 through September 17, 2018, to ITC in the interest of ensuring continuity of services for the requirements of the Office of Field Operations, San Diego Sector for these critical services. The bridge contract covers the unexpected gap between the ending of the old contract for which ITC was the incumbent, and the separate solicitation for a new longer-term competitive contract for the same services. This notice is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for prospective offerors. The determination not to compete this short-term bridge action is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest intends to award a sole source contract to Methow Natives, Winthrop, Washington, for forestry services for restoration work to prevent the spread and establishment of invasive plants, establish native vegetation, and provide visual quality on the hillsides bordering State Route (SR) 20.  In the spring of 2017, State Route (SR) 20 washed out on the Methow side of Loup Loup Pass in the vicinity of MP 212 to MP 222.  WSDOT North Central Region Office completed repair of a washed out section during the summer of 2017.
<p>Site restoration work will be performed on approximately 8 acres.  Restoration activities will include:  planting one-gallon trees, shrub and forbs; seeding; seed collection for dispersal in the fall; watering of plant; soil de-compaction; and weed control.  Restoration site should be seeded in the fall, after the area has received adequate moisture.  One-gallon plants will be planted in the fall after adequate rainfall to ensure survival.  Plants will be planted in holes large and deep enough to provide space for root growth.  Wood chips and fertilizer will be used where necessary to retain moisture and provide nutrients to the soil.</p>
<p>Contractor shall provide 400 1-gallon tree seedlings and shrubs.  Plants may include Ponderosa pine, Serviceberry, Rose, and Spirea.  Government will provide 535 lbs. of Phacelia and fireweed seed.</p>
<p>Contract performance period is from time of contract award in 2018 through December 31, 2019.</p>
<p>Service Contract Labor Standards (formerly known as the Service Contract Act of 1965) wage rates, apply.  Offerors shall possess a Washington State Farm Forest License (FLC) and a U.S., Department of Labor, Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Workers Protection Act (MSPA) Registration on the quotation due date.</p>
<p>Solicitation will be available on, or about, July 02, 2018.</p>
<p>All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the government. Prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award of a contract. Lack of registration in the SAM on the part of the offeror will render an offeror ineligible for award. Offerors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by contacting askSAM@gsa.gov, or via the Internet at http://www.sam.gov.</p>

<DESC><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1), with Carl Zeiss Microscopy for a Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope, for the Engineering Laboratory, Materials and Structural Systems Division at NIST, Gaithersburg, Maryland.</p>
<p>The Engineering Laboratory, Materials and Structural Systems Division serves as the world-class resource for developing and promoting the use of science-based tools - measurements, data, models, protocols, and reference standards - to enhance both the global competitiveness of U.S. industry through innovations in building materials and construction technology; and the safety, security, and sustainability of the nation's buildings and physical infrastructure.<br /><br />The Polymeric Materials Group of the Materials and Structural Systems Division has a requirement for a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM-LSM800). <br /><br />The required system is an upgrade to an existing laser scanning confocal microscope to replace the existing aging scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) LSM510 Meta instrument. The LSCM system is a vital technique for measuring surface/subsurface morphology, 3 dimensional (3D) microstructure, and fluorescence using multiple laser lines. The LSCM instrument is the key instrument and is heavily used for many projects (internal and external collaborations, OA, consortia) in the Polymeric Materials Group (PMG). The current instrument was manufactured in 2008 and purchased in 2009. The manufacturer (Carl Zeiss) has stopped the production of LSM510 series around 2010 and no longer provides service contract support (no software upgrade either) since 2016. Replacement parts to this old LSM have been discontinued. <br /><br />Therefore, it is vital to purchase a new LSCM to allow for uninterrupted continuation of services and projects. <br /><br />Compatibility of the new confocal microscope system to our old system in the aspect of hardware and software is crucial. Only Carl Zeiss Microscopy's LSCM is fully compatible with the current hardware and software, due to the proprietary nature of the instrument design and operation. <br /><br />Carl Zeiss Microscopy is the sole manufacturer, and sells directly to customers. No other systems in the market were identified as being compatible with the existing hardware and software.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, responses received by July 9, 2018 will be considered by the Government.</p>

<CONTACT>Cheryl D Allen, Phone 202.606.2054 , Fax 202.606.1464, Email Cheryl.Allen@opm.gov
<DESC>This is a notice of intent that the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) plans to award a non-competitive contract for Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHB) Medical Review Services to Independent Medical Expert Consulting Services, Inc. (IMEDECS), 2060 Detwiler Road, Suite 100, Harleysville, PA 19438. We will conduct this acquisition in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13. We intend to issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ) to IMEDECS for FEHB Medical Review Services and award a bridge contract resulting from the RFQ no later than July 6, 2018. The bridge contract will be indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity and include fixed prices for each contract line item number. The bridge contract will provide interim services for 30 to 90 days until the proposed contract resulting from the existing competitive acquisition can be awarded. The period of performance for the bridge contract is expected to be three months: a one-month base period and two one-month options.
<div><br />&nbsp;
<p>The purpose of this notice of intent is to satisfy the requirements of FAR Subpart 5.2. This notice of intent is not an RFQ. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement or quotation, which we will consider. All responsible sources must submit their capability statements or quotations in writing via e-mail to Cheryl D. Allen, Contracting Officer, at Cheryl.Allen@opm.gov no later than five days, 3:00 P.M. Eastern Time, of the published date of this notice. We will not consider responses received after this date and time. Verification of receipt of electronic transmissions is the sole responsibility of the respondent. The Government will not be responsible for any costs incurred for capability statements, quotations, or any other documents prepared in response to this notice. We will not issue an RFQ. We will consider any requests for an RFQ as non-responsive. A determination not to compete this action based upon responses received is the sole discretion of the Government. All contractors must be registered in System for Award Management prior to execution of a contract award. If we do not receive any viable responses, we intend to award a contract to IMEDECS without further notice.</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>The OPM Federal Employees Insurance Operations (FEIO) group administers the FEHB Program for Federal employees, retirees, temporary wildland firefighters and fire protection personnel, employees of Federally recognized Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations (tribal employer), and their eligible family members. FEIO is responsible for resolving disputed health insurance claims between members and their health insurance carrier. Two types of health insurance plans participate in the FEHB Program, Fee-for-Service (FFS) plans and Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO). FEIO is comprised of three Health Insurance Groups. Health Insurance 1 administers the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Service Benefit contract; Health Insurance 2 administers the remaining FFS plan contracts and experience-rated HMO plan contracts; and Health Insurance 3 administers the community-rated HMO plan contracts.</p>
<p>Each health plan under the FEHB Program contracts with OPM to provide certain health benefits to all members enrolled in its participating plan. Under the terms of the contract, members are entitled to pursue claims disputes by following a formal dispute resolution process described in the plan's brochure. After giving the plan the opportunity to reconsider its decision, members may request OPM to review the plan's denial of benefits or benefit limitation. OPM is responsible for making the final determination on disputes between the health benefit carrier and insured member per Title 5 U.S.C. Chapter 89, 5 CFR Part 890. In some cases, because of the complexity of the medical issue/condition involved, it is necessary to obtain an external medical review advisory opinion from a medical consultant before OPM makes a final decision on the claim.</p>
<p>Health Insurance 1 is responsible for monitoring the medical review services contract. Nurse Consultants determine the medical specialty category and the appropriate medical specialist. The contractor is required to provide an expert opinion by medical specialists appropriate to the particular disputed claim under review.</p>

DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification for Single Source Awards IAW FAR 13.106-1
For
Over Micro-Purchase Threshold but Not Exceeding the SAT ($250K)


Acquisition Plan Action ID:  VA260-18-AP-4281

Contracting Activity:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, Seattle VA Medical Center.  Facilities Management Service Purchase Request 663-18-3-211-0457

Brief Description of Supplies/ Services required and the intended use/Estimated Amount:  This requirement is to provide Puget Sound Healthcare System Gastroenterology Department with repairs and maintenance to a scope that is leased from Olympus America Inc.  

Unique characteristics that limit availability to only one source, with the reason no other supplies or services can be used:  The Seattle VAMC is currently leasing Olympus Scope GF-UE160-AL5 SN: 1111920 from Olympus.  Olympus America Inc, has proprietary rights of their equipment, and is the only authorized vendor to preform repairs and maintenance, and calibration of their scopes.  

Description of market research conducted and results or statement why it was not conducted:  A Olympus America Inc, retains full proprietary rights to this technology.  No other service provider is authorized to calibrate this equipment.  No other company is authorized to perform the repair without voiding the warranty.  Reviewing the market for similar maintenance indicates that retaining rights to this type of system is common within the industry.
 
Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Award Criteria:</span></strong></p>
<p>52.212-2 EVALUATION--COMMERCIAL ITEMS (OCT 2014)</p>
<p>(a)	The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government and whose offer is the Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable (LPTA). Award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1.	TECHNICAL AND MANAGEMENT APPROACH (non-cost)</p>
<p>Each Offeror will be evaluated on a contractor-provided approach formulated to meet the requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW). The proposal should fully outline the capabilities and methodology to provide the services as required.  Proposal must include pricing for all option periods.</p>
<p>2.	PAST PERFORMANCE (non-cost)</p>
<p>Offerors will be evaluated on their recent (within the past 3 years) performance of relevant services as described in the requirements of the SOW.  Past performance will be evaluated to determine that each offeror has performed in a satisfactory manner in the performance of similar services as those specified in the SOW and whose past performance does not pose a risk to the Government.   Offerors should provide references for the same or similar work performed for Federal, State, and local government and private clients.  For each services project used to demonstrate the relevant past performance, the Offeror must provide appropriate point of contact information for the individual within the client agency/firm overseeing the services performed.  An Offeror may also provide information on problems encountered on the identified projects and the offer's corrective actions.  The Government will consider this information, as well as information obtained from any other sources, when evaluating the offeror's past performance.  An offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance if the offeror has no record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available.</p>
<p>3.	PRICE</p>
<p>A comparison of proposal pricing received in response to the solicitation will be made in order to make a determination of fair and reasonable pricing in accordance with the Firm Fixed Price nature of this acquisition action.</p>
<p>Technical and past performance, when combined, are significantly less important than price.</p>
<p>(b)	Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c)	A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.  Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database.  Information provided to the Contractors SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the Suspension of payment paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. 

(h)  Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via the SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 866-606-8220, or 334-206-7828 for international calls.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

(a)(1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that 
(i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals 
(A) Are   are not   presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;
(B) Have   have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks  have , the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); 
(C) Are   are not   presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision;
(D) Have  , have not  , within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,500 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.
(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:
(i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(2) Examples. 
(i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C.  6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C.  6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. During the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.
(iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C.  6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.
(iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).
(ii) The Offeror has o has not o , within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. 
(2)  Principal,  for the purposes of this certification, means an officer, director, owner, partner, or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). 
This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code.
(b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.
(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible.
(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings.
(e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation -Commercial Items Oct 2014
(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical ability to meet specifications, past performance and price. Offerors shall provide specifications and other necessary information to demonstrate it meets the requirements of this solicitation (e.g. pictures, websites...). Offerors shall provide name, title and phone number of principal for no less than three prior or current contracts for similar scoped projects performed during the previous three years. To be technically acceptable, the submitting offeror must submit relevant and current past performance in ALL areas noted in this combined synopsis/solicitation. The Government will evaluate each offeror's experience on the basis of its depth and its relevance to the work that will be required under the prospective contract.

(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).

(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.
Addendum to 52.212 2  Evaluation of Commercial Items
a. BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This acquisition will utilize the Lowest Priced
Technically Acceptable (LPTA) procedure to make a best value award. A decision on the
technical acceptability of each offeror s quotations will be made. For those offerors which are
determined to be technically acceptable, award will be made to that vendor with the lowest
overall price. While the Government will strive for maximum objectivity, the technical go/no go
process, by its nature, is subjective; therefore, professional judgment is implicit throughout the
evaluation process. The Government intends to make an award based on the initial quotations. If
further questions are required, the contracting officer may contact the offeror or offerors. Award
will be made to the responsible offeror whose quotation conforms to all solicitation requirements,
such as terms and conditions, representations and certifications, technical requirements, and also
provides the best value to the Government based on the results of the evaluation described in
paragraph (b) below.
(b) The LPTA evaluation process will be accomplished as follows:
(1) Technical Acceptability. Each offeror s technical quotations will be evaluated to determine if
the offeror provides a sound, compliant approach that meets the requirements of Part 5 of the
Performance Work Statement and demonstrates a thorough knowledge and understanding of
those requirements. An evaluation rating of Technically Acceptable / Non-Acceptable will be
assigned upon completion of the technical quotations evaluation. If an Offeror receives a
technical rating of  Non-Acceptable  they will not be considered for award.

The applicable published E.O. minimum wage is incorporated by reference into this contract.
(i) The Contractor may request a price adjustment only after the effective date of the new annual E.O. minimum wage determination.

Offerors who fail to provide sufficient information (e.g. documentation, specifications, etc.) that clearly demonstrates an ability to meet the Government's technical specifications will be considered non-acceptable. If an evaluation of Non-Acceptable is received, the Offeror will not be considered for Award<br />2. Price<br />Price will be evaluated for reasonableness. Your company is encouraged to discount its rates. If price discounts are offered, identify the percentage of price discount and/or price reduction offered.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to enter into discussion and may award a purchase order on the basis of initial offers received, without discussions.

The Government may reject any or all quotations if such action is in the public interest; and issue a purchase order to other than the quoter with the lowest priced quotation.</p>
<p><br />The award will be made to the vendor whose submission represents the best value to the Government. The Government may award to other than the lowest priced Offeror or the highest technically rated Offeror utilizing trade-offs. Pricing will be evaluated separately from technical factors and used as a trade-off. The importance of price in the evaluation will increase with the degree of equality among quotations of the non-price factors.</p>
