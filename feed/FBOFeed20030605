<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition & Logistics Division, on behalf of the Manufacturing Metrology Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Fisba Optik of Rochester, NY for ITEM 0001 – Quantity 1 - Fisba Optic Model uPhase 2 SR Interferometer Probe - Specifications:  A phase shifting interferometer of the Twyman-Green type with 0.02 wavelength or better phase sensitivity and a 5 mm aperture, overall no larger in size than 170 x 170 x 50 mm - including the objective lens, with a 500 x 500 pixel resolution detector, 4% and 80% reflector, fiber coupled, single frequency, stabilized HeNe laser source, complete with dedicated PC computer system including analysis software, WIN 2000 OS, 15" flat panel display and color printer, an 8-hour laser frequency stability of less than 12 x 10E-9 and a 3-nanometer displacement repeatability.  ITEM 0002 – Quantity 1 - Fisba Optik u Lens - Specifications:  2 mm collimator, with a 10 mm working distance and a 2 pin bayonet or other appropriate mounting to match item 0001.  ITEM 0003 – Quantity 1 - External Interface Module -Specifications:  Permits Control of Fisba Interferometer via host program using Windows messaging; includes sample.

The sole source determination is based on NIST’s need for a phase measuring interferometer with 0.02 or better wave resolution, which is small enough in size to meet the technical requirements.  The probe will be moved over a small optical lens as the test piece during the measurement process.  The weight and bulk of the probe will be a limiting factor for the NIST research in both the speed of the scanning process and the close proximity of the probe to the test piece.  Fisba Optik is the only known source to meet NIST’s stringent specifications.

  ***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required on or before October 30, 2003.***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.

***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by June 16, 2003, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The Office of Management and Budget has instructed all federal agencies to adopt use of the Central Contactor Registration system as a single, government-wide system for storing contractor procurement and payment information.   By October 1, 2003, a vendor must be registered in the CCR in order to receive contracts and purchase orders from most federal agencies, including the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.  CCR is a self-service database.  Vendors register themselves and maintain their own information through the CCR web site. If not already registered, we encourage entities interested in USBR business to register in the system now, to avoid any disruption or loss of awards after the revised regulation takes effect.

<DESC>The FAA has an evolving requirement for a Service Life Extension Prog= ram (SLEP) to extend by 20 years, the service life of the Airport Surveilla= nce Radar Model 9 (ASR-9).  Included is the requirement to either extend th= e service life of co-located Mode Select Beacon System Sensor (Mode S) syst= ems or utilize an alternative.  In preparation for meeting these requiremen= ts, the FAA is completing a preliminary design study of the components and = configurations of those systems to determine how they are best changed, wit= h use of commercial off the shelf parts, in order to assure operational sup= portability while increasing reliability, easing maintainability and reduci= ng ownership costs.  The FAA is also completing an engineering model to pro= of design concepts in actual hardware and software.  Those events constitut= e the first phase of meeting the SLEP requirements. The FAA is now entering=  into a second or production/implementation phase.  It is planned for this = phase to include the final development, test, production, delivery and inst= allation of equipment.  Included also are training, engineering and logisti= cs support.  Requirements of this phase include the following: =C2=A7=09Extending the Service Life of the ASR-9 and Mode S (or utilizing a= n alternative secondary system) to at least 2025 by solving current and fut= ure supportability issues. =C2=A7=09Providing for improved reliability and easier maintenance of both = the primary and secondary systems. =C2=A7=09Reducing cost of ownership. =C2=A7=09Providing a platform that will support the implementation of futur= e requirements. =C2=A7=09Utilizing Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) and non-proprietary non-= COTs hardware and software to the fullest extent possible. =C2=A7=09Using an open system architecture that provides seamless portabili= ty to next generation COTS processors, is compatible with future technology=  insertion, and maximizes commonality of components between the ASR-9 and a=  secondary radar system. =20 The purpose of this announcement is to: =C2=B7=09Announce the Government=E2=80=99s readiness to enter into this nex= t phase of the SLEP, and gauge industry capability and interest in actively=  participating in a competitive procurement.=20 =C2=B7=09Make known the availability to industry of data generated from the=  first phase of the SLEP, and allow industry time to become familiar with t= hat information and with the respective systems. =20 =C2=B7=09Engage industry in dialogue with respect to the aforementioned dat= a and FAA plans.  =20 =C2=B7=09Make public the following WEB site: www1.faa.gov/ats/atb/sectors/s= urveillance/asr9slep Vendors interested in participating in a competitive procurement for the se= cond phase are requested to submit a capabilities statement not to exceed 1= 0 pages in length.  It is requested that this statement address the followi= ng: =20 =C2=B7=09Provide a synopsis of experience with either primary or secondary = digital radar systems, with particular focus on design and modification.  =20 =C2=B7=09Provide a synopsis of experience with developing and implementing = major hardware and software modifications to operational radars and real-ti= me data processing systems within the National Airspace System. =C2=B7=09Provide a synopsis of experience in updating complex systems for t= echnology insertion. The FAA will not use the capabilities statements to screen or down select. =  Rather, they will be used to determine the range of vendor interest, exper= ience and capability.  Also, vendors who submit the required capabilities s= tatement will be provided with a compact disk that provides documentation i= n significantly greater detail than is available via the WEB site.  Additio= nal information will be provided as it becomes available.=20 This is not a request for offers, nor is it the Government=E2=80=99s intent= ion to use this as a screening device for any such future requests.

<DESC>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is soliciting proposals under a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) for innovative research and development projects to streamline and automate analysis of forensic biological samples.  In the United States, there is a substantial backlog of samples requiring short tandem repeat (STR) DNA marker analysis.  Approximately 600,000 convicted offender samples and 180,000 no-suspect (Aunsub@) case samples currently remain to be analyzed nationwide.  To address this issue, Congress enacted The DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act of 2000, which focuses on defeating the backlog by providing additional manpower and instrumentation for use with existing STR typing methodology.  While the current STR methodologies are valid and accurate, they are also labor-intensive and time-consuming.  This BAA focuses on introducing automation into the process flow for analyzing forensic biological samples.  This is another approach to addressing the backlog of samples and preventing the backlog from recurring.  The BAA Proposal Information Packet is currently available and will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) web site http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Hard copies of the BAA document will not be available. The site provides downloading instructions.  All future information about this acquisition, including amendments, will also be distributed solely through the FBO site.  Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. This acquisition is being issued as BAA-0034339.  The FBI Laboratory is recognized as a world leader in the application of scientific methods to the examination of physical evidence in criminal investigations.  Since its inception in 1932, the FBI Laboratory has striven to enhance its services to the law enforcement and criminal justice communities through the research, development, and deployment of new or advanced forensic techniques and protocols.  The FBI Laboratory conducts research to develop new techniques of forensic analysis.  The FBI Laboratory must be in a position to provide prompt, accurate, and thorough responses to the thousands of requests it receives annually.  However, as the scientific, technical, and legal aspects of forensic science continue to become more complex, it has become increasingly challenging for the FBI to stay on the cutting edge of technology.  In order for the FBI Laboratory to continue to serve as the technical leader in the criminal justice community, it turns to outside expertise to address advanced forensic applications and initiatives.  A more detailed description of each area of interest and format of submissions is included in the Proposal Information Packet.  The Proposal Information Packet describes the process for proposal submission/evaluation.  There will be no formal Request for Proposals or other solicitation with regard to this BAA, nor does the issuance of the BAA obligate the Government to fund any subsequently invited proposals nor pay any proposal preparation costs.  Although no portion of this announcement is set?aside for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) or Minority Institutions (MI) participation, the Government encourages applications from these institutions.  Proposals from all responsible sources capable of satisfying the Governments needs may be submitted and shall be considered.  This notice constitutes a BAA as authorized by FAR 6.102 (d) (2) (i).

A Qualified Laboratories List (QLL) is available through the Commander, DPSC, 2800 South 20th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19101, ATTN: DPSC&#64979;POL. Any laboratory proposed by the contractor not on the QLL is subject to the approval of the Contracting Officer. (b)	Government QAR will cut samples from a lot at the textile component source and  send them for testing to the Qualified Laboratory (QL) cited below. (The acceptability of each lot will be determined through the testing of these samples). In addition, the QAR will simultaneously cut samples from the same rolls of material and send them to the DPSC Laboratory. For end items, duplicate samples will be drawn. Source sampling procedures are detailed further in DPSC Manual, Quality Systems Requirement, 4155.3, which is incorporated by reference. (c) 	The prime contractor will notify the DPSC Laboratory (DPSC&#64979;POL #215&#64979;'737&#64979;7052) in writing at least ten (10) days in advance when lots are to be presented to allow Government witnessing of QL testing. If the Government intends to witness testing, a representative from the DPSC laboratory will notify the QL. In the absence of Government notification, testing should proceed as scheduled. (d) If a laboratory is removed from the QLL during the course of a contract, DPSC will perform the required testing for up to 30 calendar days from the date of removal. The contractor is responsible for securing the services of another QL during this period. The charge for testing will be the DPSC Laboratory's effective cost rate on the date of testing.

	NAME AND ADDRESS COMPONENT SOURCE: [                                          ]. * When a single lot of material requires testing by more than one laboratory for difference characteristics, list the name of the secondary laboratory and test characteristics below:

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH),  National Cancer Institute (NCI), Chemical Immunology Section of the Laboratory of Cell Biology (LCB), intends to procure on a sole source basis with the University of Pittsburgh, 3109 Cathedral of Learning Pittsburgh, PA 15260, services to test the in vivo efficacy of novel pyridinioalkanoyl thioester (PATE) compounds developed by the LCB using the non-human primate model of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection established at the University of Pittsburgh.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures authorized by FAR Part 13.   The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541710 and the business size standard is 500 employees.  The Chemical Immunology Section of LCB has been involved in AIDS research for several years.  The Section synthesizes novel compounds targeted to retroviral nucleocapsid proteins and determines their suitability as drugs for treating infections with HIV-1 or other retroviruses.  The University of Pittsburgh Primate Facility for Infectious Disease Research has performed PATE compound efficacy studies using the SIV cynomolgus monkey model.  The studies are pilot experiments and are designed to address whether administration of PATE compounds at two different doses for a short time period is effective at reducing viral load when compared to animals infected but not treated with drugs.  Virus loads will be determined using real-time RT-PCR by the Murphey-Corb Laboratory.  The University of Pittsburgh has provided  preclinical in vivo evaluations which are essential to further the development of novel NCp7 inhibitors and advancement to clinical testing under a previous contract awarded by the NCI.  Contractor shall provide a report to LCB with data on virus load in treated animals; and shall measure drug toxicity.  The University of Pittsburgh Primate Facility for Infectious Disease Research is a state-of-the-art facility that has expertise in non-human primate models of HIV using the SIV model.  Dr. Barratt-Boyes is an expert in cellular vaccines for SIV and the study of dendritic cells, which are essential cells in the generation of antiviral immune responses. Dr. Murphey-Corb is the director of the facility with 20 years experience working in the SIV/rhesus macaque model, with interests in DNA vaccination for SIV.  Dr. Murphey-Corb's laboratory has developed a highly sensitive assay to reproducibly detect low levels of circulating virus by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).  In the past twelve months, Dr. Murphey-Corb has developed the cynomolgus monkey as a valid non-human primate model for SIV infection.  This model provides an ideal experimental infection with which to test the efficacy of PATE compounds that is highly related to the natural HIV infection of humans.  Dr's. Barratt-Boyes and Murphey-Corb are uniquely qualified to provide the required services with their expertise in the SIV/non-human primate model.   Period of Performance: upon award of purchase order through 12 months  with one (1) option not to exceed 10 months.   FAR Clause 52.217-8 Option to Extend Services (November 1999) and 52.217-9 Option to Extend the Term of the Contract (March 2000)  applies to this order.  Changing variables at this time will interrupt correct interpretation of current experiment in progress.  This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.  All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the Contracting Office by 1:00 PM EDT (local Washington, D.C. time) on June 20, 2003.  If you have any questions, please contact Malinda Holdcraft, Purchasing Agent via electronic mail at holdcram@exchange.nih.gov or by fax (301) 402-4513.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>It is the intent of National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure on a sole source basis from The Medical Library Center of New York (MLCNY) approximately 20,000 journal issues, which are indicated as missing from NLM's general collection.  NLM intends to procure services and materials from MLC for a period of six months.  The initial period of performance is anticipated to begin on or about July 1, 2003 and finish before the Medical Library Center permanently closes before the end of calendar year 2003.  In November 2002, The Medical Library Center of New York Board of Trustees voted to begin the process to dissolve that institution.  As part of that process, the MLCNY Board solicited offers to the National Library of Medicine and other parties interesting in bidding on all or parts of its extensive retrospective collection of health and allied sciences serials.  NLM made a successful no-cost bid in March 2003, and the Medical Library Center subsequently agreed to give NLM the journals needed to fill in missing volumes in the general collection.  This acquisition can only be made through the Medical Library Center of New York, as no other institution has made a similar offering of its collection, and NLM knows of no other institution of similar caliber that might be willing to donate large portions of its collection to NLM.  There is no cost for the journals being offered to NLM; costs only apply to the shipping and handling involved.  The MLCNY staff is knowledgeable about the location of the materials and is fully familiar with NLM bibliographic records for the purpose of comparing what is held at MLC to what is needed by NLM.  For this reason the staff of the Medical Library Center will be pulling the needed volumes from the MLC collection and packaging them in preparation for shipment to NLM.  A third party shipping company will be used to transport the material to the National Library of Medicine.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisitions.  This is not a Request for Quotations (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsible sources may submit a proposal, which will be considered by the NLM.  Firms interested in responding to this notice must be able to provide service as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in this office within fifteen (15) calendar days from publication date of this notice, and must include pricing information and meet the criteria requirement.  Inquiries regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H. Phuong, Lead Purchasing Agent, on (301) 496-6127.  Fax requests WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number for this acquisition is NOI3055 and the solicitation is being issued as a notice of intent.  This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2001-14.  The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis using simplified acquisition procedures with the Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative of Toronto, Canada for rare HIV patient samples. These specimens can only be obtained from 0.2 % of the general HIV patient population and the Canadian Immunodeficiency Research Collaborative has a large cohort of these.  Currently, our research is wholly dependent on the use of these specimens as part of Project No. Z01 AI 000851-04, The Role of Viral Reservoirs in the Pathogenesis of HIV Disease.   Many of our experiments require repeated collation of cells from these patients as part of longitudinal analyses.  In addition, given that we cannot obtain the numbers of cells that are necessary to complete our analysis by one visit, it is critical to receive the samples continuously from these patients in order to successfully execute our project.  Sample preparation will include leukopheresis, lymphocyte isolation, in vitro testing and cryopreservation.  This is not a Small-Business Set Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 621511 and the small-business size standard is $11.5 million dollars.  These items will be delivered to a NIAID facility in Bethesda, MD.

<CONTACT>DAVID H. PLAGGE, Placement Contracting Officer, Phone: (513) 487-2022, E-Mail: plagge.david@epa.gov
<DESC>In accordance with FAR Part 13 and FAR Part 12, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory located in Ann Arbor, Michigan is  seeking to procure engine dynamometers and test cell control systems. As part of the Clean Air Act and its Amendments, a variety of new emissions regulations have been implemented for large on-road and off-road engines.  The 2007 Diesel engine rulemaking is an example of testing requiring advanced engine operation and integrated test cell control.  The EPA NVFEL has undertaken a comprehensive program to implement new and refined test systems to enhance the capabilities to conduct diverse engine emissions testing, of the highest precision and accuracy, on a broad range of engines.  As such, NVFEL has a requirement for engine dynamometers and test cell control systems that will be required for implementing these enhanced capabilities.  The equipment shall be installed as integrated systems at NVFEL, in rooms 413/415, known as HD Dyno 2, with the second, nearly identical, system to be installed in rooms  419/421, known as HD Dyno 4.  These dynamometers and control systems shall be used to evaluate both regulated emissions and currently unregulated emissions from Diesel engines, operating in a variety of ambient conditions and on a variety of fuels including those currently considered as "alternative".  This specification addresses requirements to operate engines to measure emissions at levels lower than current standards. The core requirements will be for two (2) highly flexible engine test cell controller and data acquisition systems, two (2) engine dynamometers, two (2) engine throttle controllers/positioners, two (2) dedicated safety monitoring systems and two (2) test cell instrument booms, for two separate test cells at EPA.  All services to fully integrate this equipment and other existing test cell equipment to provide a highly efficient and effective test system shall be included.  Equipment interface requirements and other support equipment are also required.  Additional equipment (electronic barometer electronic hygrometer and dry-bulb temperature instrument, cabinets to contain the equipment)  is required.  The contractor shall be accountable for supervising any and all subcontractors that they bring to the job site.  The solicitation will include an option for: (1) additional, complete Test-Control, Data Acquisition and Processing System, Throttle Controller/Amplifier/Servo, Stand Alone Safety System, Test Cell Instrumentation Interface; (2) a combustion analysis system for each TDAP system provided under the contract; and (3) three one-year options for extended maintenance.  EPA is also considering a potential option to implement one dynamometer as a "double-ended" dynamometer (meaning that test engines will be installed at either end of the dynamometer, requiring a change of drive shafts and as few other modifications as possible, to switch testing between two engines); The successful contractor will have to system responsibility (including design/configuration, assembly, integration, quality assurance, delivery to EPA-NVFEL, installation, calibration, commissioning, acceptance testing, documentation and training of EPA staff).  The successful contractor shall provide for the removal of the existing dynamometer, HD Dyno 2.  Removal shall include all peripheral dynamometer equipment. This procurement will be made using "Best Value" evaluation criteria and will be competed using Full and Open Competition.  The solicitation should be issued around June 18, 2003 on EPA website:  http://www.epa.gov/oam/cinn_cmd.  This office does not intend to mail hard copies of the solicitation.  All responsible sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  Interested parties should submit a written request to receive the Statement of Work and RFQ (SF 1449) to Mr. David Plagge at the above address, by Fax at (513) 487-2107 or by e-mail plagge.david@epa.gov.

<DESC>USAID intends to issue a RFP for construction services for a pipeline installation contract in the Palestinian West Bank.  This contract is open for competition by local Palestinian contractors according to 22-CFR228.40-d (Local Procurement estimated not to exceed $5,000,000).

The Bani Naim Bulk Water Supply project is a continuation of USAID’s effort to bring more water to the southern West Bank and West Hebron villages. To accomplish this, the project is designed to transmit water supplies from the Bani Naim wellfield to the Halhul and Yatta reservoirs. The project is intended to deliver an additional 325 m3/hr in the short term, and ultimately 700m3/hour in the longer term, to the water supplies currently available to the southern West Bank. 
 
The scope of this contract is limited to the installation of government furnished pipes.  Work must be self performed by the contractor with minimal, if any, subcontracting of construction work.

The total length of the pipeline installation required for the contractor to construct is approximately 28.9 km.  Pipe material will be ductile iron (bell and spigot, restrained joint) when the pressure rating of the pipe is 16 bar or less, and welded steel when the pressure rating of the pipe is greater than 16 bar.  The specifications, drawings and detailed information concerning the work under this award will be issued with the RFP to interested contractors.
 
The construction contractor will enter into a direct contract with USAID.  Bidding will be open to American and Class A local Palestinian contractors that give the best value to the U.S. Government. The contractor will be expected to have similar construction experience and demonstrated capability of managing such project under the current conditions of political unrest.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition & Logistics Division, on behalf of the Precision Engineering Division, intends to negotiate on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1), with Hitachi High Technologies of Pleasanton, CA, for the upgrade of an S-4700 field emission scanning electron microscope.  NIST's existing scanning electron microscope, Model S-4700, will be upgraded to the Model S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope.  The upgrade is required to be a replacement to the existing system and make use of all existing digital imaging hardware and software.  The upgrade will assist NIST in meeting the goal of performing dimensional measurements with the previously unattainable spatial resolutions of 1.4 nm at 1 kV accelerating voltage and 1 nm at 15 kV accelerating voltage. This upgrade will also make it possible to use transmission electron signals in the scanning electron microscope.  Sole source determination is based on Hitachi High Technologies being the sole manufacturer and provider of the existing equipment, the equipment required for the upgrade, and software necessary to utilize the equipment. Furthermore, the existing Hitachi High Technologies equipment is a scanning electron microscope that NIST has built hardware and software around.  These are well integrated and fully compatible additions into the larger system, which is being used in the development of dimensional reference samples.  Hitachi High Technologies is the only manufacturer who can provide an upgrade that will be a drop in replacement of the current system and utilize all existing programming and hardware development efforts.  Hitachi is also providing a trade-in credit for the existing equipment.  ***Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and is required within 90 days after receipt of order.  ***The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.  ***No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations, however, responses received by June 19, 2003, will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Laboratory of Biosystems and Cancer (LBC) intends to procure BAC DNA sequencing from Fidelity Systems Inc., 7961 Cessna Ave, Gaithersburg, MD20879.   A mission of the LBC is the studying of tumor suppressor genes.  The Genome Structure and Function Section is a research group within LBC, concentrating on the comparison human and non-human primates genes to clarify a role of interspersed mobile elements, including Alu elements in human evolution.  High accuracy of BAC DNA sequencing is required to follow evolution of two human disease genes, BRCA1 and MCPH5, and explain a high mutation rate of these genes in primates.  Sequencing must be performed directly from BAC template without prior subcloning or PCR amplification of sub-fragments to avoid cloning artifacts and errors during assemble.  Fidelity Systems, Inc. is uniquely qualified to perform this sequencing since they have developed a novel method for a high quality DNA sequence analysis based on use of 2'-modified oligonucleotides from 2'-methoxyoxalamido (MOX) and 2'-succinimido (SUC) precursors, "ThermoFidelase" Covered by U.S. Patents 5,427,928, 5,656,463. Patents pending.  Sequencing is performed directly from BAC or YAC template without prior subcloning or PCR amplification of sub-fragments. New advanced method produced DNA sequence with no errors.   This procurement is commercial as defined in FAR Part 2, and this acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program using simplified procedures for certain commercial items as authorized in FAR 13.5.  This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, it may submit a statement of capabilities. The statement of capabilities and any other information furnished must be in writing and must contain material in sufficient detail to allow the NCI researcher to determine if the party can perform this requirement. An original and one copy of the capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 p.m. EDT, on June 12, 2003.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to dm170b@nih.gov .  It is the vendor's responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to insure questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted. NAICS 541380.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Answer 2:	At this time it is expected to remain the same. Question 3:	Regarding the SAR data, is there a potential agreement for access?

REQUEST FOR SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS

PROJECT TITLE: GUARD STATION RENOVATIONS  
UILDING NUMBER: PA0599ZZ

UILDING NAME: WM. J. NEALON F/B & CTHSE.   
A/E: HEMMLER & CAMAYD ARCHITECTS 


This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only. In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation. 

REASONABLE CARE:

1. Limiting dissemination to authorized users. Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it. The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know. Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA. This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE: It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records of recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

Valid identification for non-Government users. Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information. The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination. Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary:

(a) A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business. The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company. The business must be of the type required to do the work. A general contractor’s license may be substituted for the business license in states that do not issue such licenses. In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and

(b) Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certification. Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and

(c) A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary,

(d) A Valid picture state driver’s license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents. Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents. SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) through (c), above.

2. Retaining and destroying documents. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CD’s, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3. Term of Effectiveness. The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government. Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.

4. Written agreement of disposal. For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor’s record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work). Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software. The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.
 

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

<DESC>This procurement is being advertised on an unrestricted basis inviting full and open competition.  This procurement consists of one solicitation with the intent to award three or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Construction Contracts to the responsible proposers whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the Best Value, cost or price and other factors considered.  AWARD MAY BE MADE TO A FIRM OTHER THAN THAT SUBMITTING THE LOWEST PRICE.  OFFERORS ARE ADVISED AWARD MAY BE MADE WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSAL RECEIVED.  THEREFORE OFFERORS INITIAL PROPOSALS SHOULD CONTAIN THE OFFERORS BEST TERM.  This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices.  The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.  Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis.  The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction and renovation by design-build or (to a lesser extent) design-bid-build of Industrial Building Construction at various locations within Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Washington, and Alaska.  The North American Industry Code Standard is 236210 and the annual size standard is $28.5 million.  In support of design-build strategies, each Offeror shall possess in-house capabilities or employ the services of a Lead Design Firm (A-E) experienced in the design development and coordination of projects within the scope of this contract.  Offerors may offer multiple design teams to satisfy a variety of project types projected to be awarded during the term of contract(s).  The Offeror and the proposed Lead Design Firm(s) for the basic contract(s) will be evaluated as a team.  Lead Design Firm(s) (A-E), their subsidiaries and affiliates that are involved at the RFP or design stage of a particular project will not be allowed to propose or be used on a Task Order for that project.  After award of the initial contracts, each awardee shall be provided a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order, except under those circumstances described in the contract.  Should any of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, award factors may be modified in order to ensure each participating contractor is awarded task orders.  The basic contract period will be for 12 months (or earlier as determined by the Contracting Officer after the government orders the maximum per contract amount of $100 million).  Each contract contains four (4) 12-month options for a total maximum duration of 60 months or a value of $100 million, whichever occurs first.  The minimum task order amount for this contract is $7,000,000.  The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order.  The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered, however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $25,000 is guaranteed to be ordered to each awardee, under the basic performance period of the contract.  Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee.  The Two Phase Design-Build procedures of FAR 36.3 will be used for this procurement.  Phase One of the solicitation is in accordance with FAR Part 36.3.  Phase One evaluation will result in a determination of the most highly qualified Offerors.  These Offerors will be requested to submit a Phase Two proposal.  The maximum number of Offerors that will be selected to submit a Phase Two proposal is eight (8).  Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals by the Offerors selected in Phase One, which will be evaluated separately in accordance with Part 15.  The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions.  The Government reserves the right to substitute or add other Design-Build projects that meet the scope of the MACC, prior to the receipt of Phase Two proposals.  Selection for award will be based evaluation of the following:  Phase One:  Factor 1 - Past Performance of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 2 – Support of Small Business; Factor 3 - Experience of Offeror and Offeror's Team; Factor 4 – Technical Approach.  Phase Two:  Factor 5 - Engineering Solutions of Offeror's Team; Factor 6 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).  The recommended subcontracting goals for the contract value (base and all options periods) are as follows:  8% - Woman-Owned Small Business; 10% - Small Disadvantaged Business; 3% - HUBZone Small Business; 3% - Veteran-Owned Small Business; 3% - Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business; 1% - Utilization of Locally-Owned Small Business (for work in remote areas); - and 27% Other Small Business.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 513390 This amendmend provides clarification to questions about the statement of work.   Please contact Ed Brosnan at brosnan.edward@epa.gov if have any questions. Question 1. Is the NOAA or EPA providing a Program Producer for the two day event and if so is there a show  schedule or rundown that details show content? Answer 1.  NOAA is providing the Program Producer for the two day event.  We just nailed down the schedule this week, it could change, but at this time we think the schedule will be as shown in the attachment: To learn more about EstuaryLive, please  visit www.estuarylive.org.   To learn more about EPA's National Estuary Program, please visit http://www.epa.gov/owow/estuaries/.   To learn more about NOAA's National Estuarine Research Reserves Program, please visit http://www.ocrm.nos.noaa.gov/nerr/welcome.html. Question 2. Do we know specific  locations in the various states that will be participating in the event & will the locations need downlink or have internet connections to view the webcast? Answer 2. Beaufort, NC Charlotte Harbor, FL Galveston Bay, TX Jacques Cousteau NERR, NJ Padilla Bay, WA Barataria-Terrebonne Estuary,  LA North Inlet-Winyah Bay, SC South Slough, OR The sites do not need downlink and will most likely not be able to view the program as it is in process from their remote site.  There will be no internet connections at most of the remote sites (simply because they are remote).  Question 3. Have we  thought about preproducing pieces prior to the event to run during the webcast that could give a more detailed explanation of topics than can be accomplished during a live webcast? Answer 3.   Based on our experience in prior years, we want to minimize the use of pre-recorded material.  It  detracts from the live qualities of the program and experience.   Question 4. Where can I get the logos for the graphics that we would have built? (i.e. NOAA & EPA logo) Answer 4.   EPA and NOAA will provide the logos. Question 5. Do we know how long each day of programming is? Answer 5.    See the attachment referenced in the response to question #1. Question 6.   Will the encoding to the webcast be done onsite and if so are there backup encoders and landline connections available? Answer 6. No.  The server/streaming provider will provide this service under a separate  contract. Question 7.  Can we test all the elements of the broadcasts on the 24th during the production meetings? Answer 7.   No.  We expect to work with highly experienced professionals who are familiar with the conditions particular to the EstuaryLive production environment.  All of the live  sites are preparing backup plans should something go wrong at the last minute. 8.  Please Note:  This Statement of work does not require captioning services. The date for Quotes remains the same, due by noon, June 19, 2003.

<DESC>Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial of corticosteroids versus placebo in patients undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary atresia

National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK): Opportunity for collaborations to implement a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trial of corticosteroids versus placebo in patients undergoing hepatoportoenterostomy for biliary atresia.  A prospective database of pediatric cases of neonatal cholestasis will also be created by the newly formulated NIDDK-funded Biliary Atresia Research Consortium that will allow prospective evaluation and follow-up of a large group of patients.  Ancillary studies to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia also pose opportunities for collaborations.

SUMMARY:  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is seeking proposals in the form of capability statements from companies for collaborative arrangements to provide corticosteroids, placebo (for corticosteroids), a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and Medium chain triglyceride (MCT)-containing formula to perform a prospective randomized controlled trial of therapy of  biliary atresia.  The NIDDK is also seeking proposals from companies for a collaboration to evaluate the natural history, pathogenesis, diagnosis, genetic factors, and determinants of progression and severity of biliary atresia and other forms of neonatal cholestasis. 
	Collaborative arrangements may be either Clinical Trial Agreements or Cooperative Research and Developments Agreements (CRADAs) pursuant to the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 (FTTA, 15 U.S.C. 3710; and Executive Order 12591 of April 10, 1987, as amended by the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995), as appropriate.  The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) seeks one or more collaborations with pharmaceutical or biotechnology company(ies) to provide corticosteroids, placebo, a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat soluble vitamins and MCT-containing formula to study important issues regarding possible treatment options and disease progression in biliary atresia.  The potential Collaborator(s) capability statement should provide proof of expertise in the design and implementation of studies involving pharmacologic and/or nutritional therapy of newborns and infants.  The statement should include the scientific rationale for the study proposed in biliary atresia, proposed dosing regimes, possible strategies for assessing compliance, proposed methods for assessing levels and/or biological effects of corticosteroids, ursodeoxycholic acid and fat soluble vitamins.  In addition, collaborators are being sought for ancillary studies.  Examples of potential studies include: 
1)	The identification of host genetic factors associated with the development of biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis and with the risk of poor outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. This will involve the analysis of genomic DNA from individuals with biliary atresia as well as neonatal cholestasis for functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in prioritized candidate genes, which have been identified using a combination of literature search and informatic algorithms including biologic mechanisms, pathogenesis, linkage analysis and biochemical studies.
2)	Development of methods for screening for novel or known infectious etiologies that may be associated with the development of biliary atresia.
3)	Development and/or refinement of new techniques for the diagnosis of biliary atresia and/or the evaluation of neonatal cholestasis.  These might include but are not limited to serum biochemical markers, radiologic/nuclear medicine imaging techniques, and liver histologic/histochemical markers.
4)	Exploration of biochemical and clinical markers to predict outcome after hepatoportoenterostomy. 
5)	Development of gene expression arrays that are diagnostic of biliary atresia and would provide staging and grading of the degree of cell injury, cholestasis and fibrosis in the liver as well as insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.
6)	Development of strategies for assessing vaccine response in infants with biliary atresia who receive either corticosteroids or placebo after hepatoportoenterostomy.  This will involve but is not limited to measuring antibody titers to vaccine antigens routinely given during the first six months of life and providing a plan for revaccination if protective levels of antibodies are not found.
7)	Development of a molecular footprint for biliary atresia.  This can be accomplished by two independent methodologies using high throughput profiling. The first will be proteomics of circulating proteins from patients with biliary atresia or diseased-controls (other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis of infancy). The second will be expression profiling using high-density gene chips and liver samples from patients with biliary atresia and diseased controls. These complimentary approaches will provide insight into potential diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets for children with biliary atresia.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  Clinical Trial Agreements and CRADAs are agreements designed to enable certain collaborations between Government laboratories and non-Government laboratories. They are not grants, and not contracts for the procurement of goods/services. The NIDDK is prohibited from transferring funds to a Clinical Trial or CRADA collaborator. Under a CRADA, NIDDK can contribute facilities, staff, materials, and expertise to the effort. The collaborator typically contributes facilities, staff, materials, expertise, and funding to the collaboration. The CRADA collaborator receives an exclusive option to negotiate an exclusive or non-exclusive license to Government intellectual property rights arising under the CRADA in a pre-determined field of use and make contributions that qualify one or more of its employees as a co-inventor(s) of new technology developed under the CRADA. 
•	Study Goal:  The overall goal of this study is to perform clinical, epidemiological and therapeutic research in patients with biliary atresia using a standardized and coordinated approach to the evaluation and therapy of biliary atresia and to provide sufficient numbers of patients for the research.  This will be done by development of a database of infants with neonatal cholestasis and biliary atresia including clinical information as well as serum and tissue samples.  In addition, the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium will conduct a prospective, randomized, double blind controlled trial of promising therapies for biliary atresia, including use of corticosteroids compared to placebo.    
Applicants for a collaborative arrangement to support this clinical trial must include a description of investigators and staff with experience and expertise to collaborate in multicenter clinical studies to assess patients with biliary atresia and neonatal cholestasis.  Applicants should provide a detailed description of the pharmacokinetics of the proposed drugs to be used including how and when the drugs should be taken.  The process for biologic sample collection, storage and handling needs must be included.  A description of the laboratory tests that are needed to monitor therapy, including assays to determine specific drug levels and/or biological effects along with appropriate methods for performing them should be provided, as well as other core facilities and interactions with core facilities that are needed.  Also included should be the methods that would be used to assure privacy and maintain confidentiality of data.  How the drug or product will be sent to each participating center as well as packaging, storing, and accountability issues must be presented.
Capability Statements:  A Selection Committee will utilize the information provided in the “Collaborator Capability Statements” received in response to this announcement to help in its deliberations.  It is the intention of the NIDDK that all qualified Collaborators have the opportunity to provide information to the Selection Committee through their capability statements.  The Capability Statement should not exceed 10 pages.  Capability statements related to the investigation of corticosteroids, a liquid formulation of ursodeoxycholic acid, fat-soluble vitamins and MCT-containing formula in patients with biliary atresia and/or neonatal cholestasis should address the following selection criteria: 
1.	The statement should provide specific details of the methods to be utilized and clearly describe important issues surrounding the evaluation of disease progression in these patients.
2.	The statement should include a detailed plan demonstrating the ability to provide sufficient quantities of the therapeutic agents and nutritional products in a timely manner for the duration of the study. 
3.	The statement may include outcome measures of interest to the Collaborator.  The specifics of the proposed outcome measures and the proposed support should include but not be limited to therapeutic treatment and evaluation of biliary atresia or neonatal cholestasis, specific funding commitment to support the advancement of scientific research, personnel, services, facilities, equipment, or other resources that would contribute to the conduct of the commercial development.
4.	The statement must address willingness to promptly publish research results and ability to be bound by PHS intellectual property policies if a CRADA is entered (see CRADA:  http://ott.od.nih.gov/newpages/crada.pdf).

DATES:  Only written capability statements received by the NIDDK on or before June 9, 2003, will be considered.   Applicants meeting the criteria as set forth in this announcement may be invited at the Applicants’ own expense to discuss with the Study Steering Committee their plans, capabilities, and research findings pertinent to the study at a meeting of the Study’s Steering Committee on date to be determined.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate (AFRL/MN) is interested in receiving technical and cost proposals for the study of the behavior of tantalum in proto-type warhead designs; and consolidation and fabrication of warhead liner blanks from powder tantalum to be delivered to the Damage Mechanisms Branch at Eglin Air Force Base, FL. One of the manufacturing methods of interest is the use of powder tantalum as a means for making warhead liner blanks. Working with powder tantalum could eliminate the technical risk associated with using wrought tantalum products. There may also be a cost savings found in the fabrication of a near net shape piece that generates less scrap material. One of the engineering parameters identified in limited studies of powder tantalum is the effect of oxygen concentration in the starting powder. Excessively high concentration of oxygen, 300 parts per million (PPM) by weight, is known to produce deficiencies in the performance of the material. Specifically, the material ductility, needed for explosive formation, is seriously degraded. The specific steps (tasks) involved within this effort by the contractor are to be as follows: 1. Procure starting stock of tantalum powder with oxygen content specified to be no greater than 150 PPM. 2. Characterize the initial starting stock. 3. Consolidate the powder into cylinders (Dimensions 2.50 inch Diameter x 3.5 inch Length). 4. Characterize the consolidated tantalum. 5. Fabricate the consolidated tantalum cylinders, by open die forging, into a final work piece 9.0 inch diameter by 0.25 inch thick. 6. Ship deliverables to Eglin AFB, FL. Deliverables required by Air Force Research Laboratory, Munitions Directorate: 20 pieces of consolidated and processed tantalum plates in the dimensions described in step 5 with a final report providing the characterization details found in steps 2 and 4.  Contractor formatted report is acceptable. Submit 1 hard copy of the report and 1 copy electronically.This acquisition is unrestricted (i.e., considered full and open competition). Thus, all qualifying, responsible sources may submit a proposal that will be considered against the criteria set forth herein. Firms responding to this solicitation should provide their business status as defined in FAR clause 52.219-1 for NAICS Code 541710 (500 employees). Proposals submitted must be in accordance with this announcement, and must be received no later than 4:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time on 20 June 2003. Address proposals to AFRL/MNK, Attn: S.

<DESC>The Technical Support Working Group (TSWG) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Exploitation Office (DARPA/IEO) are jointly soliciting concepts for innovative research and development projects.  TSWG and DARPA/IXO are interested in advanced technology focused on the development of extremely small beacon devices capable of communicating low-duty factor, short-burst, low-rate data messages over very long ranges using a very small/low-power device.  Such devices could be applied to various missions, including blue force tracking, combat identification, dismounted soldier tracking, vehicle and logistics tagging, and small sensor data exfiltration.  The Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) package and instructions will be available only from the BAA Information System (BIDS) website: http://www.bids.tswg.gov.  The BAA process constitutes a solicitation of concepts from those Offerors capable of satisfying the Government's needs.  While the Government encourages all sources to submit research concepts for consideration, Offerors must meet the minimum eligibility standards stated in section 2.1 of the BAA.  The package describes the full process for submission and evaluation.  Potential Offerors are encouraged to download the BAA package from the website as of the date of this synopsis.  Any questions regarding this BAA should be directed to the email address listed below.  For any difficulties associated with downloading the BAA, please contact the TSWG office at http://www.bids.tswg.gov or via email at bidshelp@tswg.gov.

<DESC>Organizational Overview The U.S. Department of Energy?s Office of Science (SC) is the single largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences in the United States, providing more than 40 percent of total funding for this vital area of national importance. It oversees ? and is the principal federal funding agency of the Nation?s research programs in high energy physics, nuclear physics, and fusion energy sciences.  DOE manages fundamental research programs in basic energy sciences, biological and environmental sciences, and computational science. In addition, SC is the Federal Government?s largest single provider of materials science and it supports unique and vital parts of U.S. research in climate change, geophysics, genomics, life sciences, and science education. The fundamental purpose of the R&D enterprise is to make progress on key science topics.  But the R&D cycle is incomplete until the knowledge is shared.  Sharing science knowledge is the enabler for future scientific discovery.  Thus, the fundamental purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to identify opportunities to enhance the ability of SC to identify and use published science information relevant to DOE R&D activities. Description SC is surveying the market to explore existing tools, products, or technologies which either provide, or could easily be adapted to provide, access to a cross-publisher searching capability.  Such a tool would enable simultaneous searching of the full text of journal articles in scientific disciplines of concern to SC and DOE.  While an initial core set of journal titles has been identified, the journal titles accessible through this full text search tool must be adjustable and expandable. SC users of the tool should be able to submit terms or phrases in a search query and receive real-time results from distributed sites in order of relevance.  In addition to a listing of relevancy ranked search results, the results should include a synopsis (i.e., abstract) of the article and links to related articles.  Users must be able to link directly to the full text of the requested article. Specifically, this RFI seeks the following information: -  Descriptions of existing or adaptable tools, products, or technologies as described above. -  Technical feasibility assessments. -  Approximate cost information (order of magnitude, ballpark estimates, etc.) and alternative methods of payment (fee for service, annual product license, etc.). -  Ideas and suggestions that provide alternative approaches to the ability to meet the described objectives. - Whether the company?s products or services are available through GSA Schedule and, if so, the schedule number and company?s business classification (small business, 8(a), other than small business, etc.). Assumptions and Agreements -  The DOE encourages creativity and innovation in response to this RFI. -  Partnerships and collaborative arrangements related to product and technology recommendations should be described as part of the response to the RFI. -  Concepts presented should consider that high speed networks could enable real-time exchange of large volumes of full text literature and relevancy ranking abilities.  Mirror sites on high speed networks may be necessary for information not hosted with sufficient high speed capacities. -  Respondents shall demonstrate existing tools, products, or technologies to the DOE. Sample Response Format Following is a suggested outline for a response to this RFI.  This outline is intended to minimize the effort of the respondent and structure the responses for ease of analysis by the government.  Nevertheless, respondents are free to develop their responses as they see fit. -  Executive Summary -  Corporate Expertise -  Product/Technology Descriptions -  Feasibility Assessments -  Cost Information -  GSA Schedule Information, if Applicable -  Additional Information Deemed Appropriate for Inclusion Disclaimer This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation.  This RFI may or may not result in an award of a contract. All information received in response to this RFI should be non-proprietary. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. All responses are due by July 3, 2003, and shall be electronically submitted via the IIPS system to Suzanne Chacko, the designated contract specialist. If there are questions about this request for information, contact Ms. Chacko via e-mail at chackosm@oro.doe.gov.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, on behalf of the Program Manager for Conventional Ammunition, is seeking sources of non-development improvements to the existing 20mm MK 244 Armor Piercing Discarding Sabot (APDS) propellant.  Improvements must include a non-compaction (loose filled) or single compaction propellant which maintains an Insensitive Munitions (IM) certification.  The propellant is required to meet MIL-P-3984J (Amendment), Propellant for Small Arms Ammunition, MIL-STD-2105B, Hazard Assessment Tests for Non-Nuclear Munitions, and MIL-STD- 286C, Propellants Solids: Sampling Examination and Testing. The cartridge is an electric-primed 20-millimeter MK 244 APDS designed to function in the Phalanx Close-In Weapons Systems 20-mm M61A1 gun barrel.  The 20mm cartridge consists of a projectile assembly, and a M103 cartridge case with a M52A3B1 electric  primer.  Principle components of the projectile assembly are a pusher plug, a sub-caliber projectile (commonly referred to as the penetrator), and integral discarding sabot-driving band. The average velocity requirements for cartridges conditioned at 70 plus or minus 2 degrees F, measured at 78 feet from the test barrel muzzle, shall be 3610 plus or minus 50 feet per second (fps).  The standard deviation of the measured test velocities shall be 25 fps or less for cartridges condition at minus 20, plus 70, and plus 130 degrees F.  For MK 244 reference cartridges, the grand average of the velocity shall be 3610 plus or minus 20 fps and the pooled standard deviation shall not exceed 20 fps.   The average velocity for the waterproof test cartridges shall be within 100 fps of the average velocity of the dry test cartridges (as described above).  The standard deviation of the m easured test velocities shall be 28 fps or less.  If the velocity requirement and/or standard deviation requirement is not met, a second sample of double the original sample size shall be tested.  The cumulative (original sample (20) plus second sample (40)) test results shall meet waterproof requirements. The action time between application of voltage to firing pin and exit of the projectile from the muzzle shall not exceed 4.5 milliseconds (ms) at cartridge temperatures of minus 20 degrees F, 70 degrees F, and 130 degrees F.  The average action time plus four (4) standard deviations of each test sample of the cartridges at minus 20 degrees F, 70 degrees F, and 130 degrees F shall not exceed 4.5 ms.   The average peak case mouth pressure of the MK 244 cartridges at plus 70 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees F shall not exceed 61,600 pounds per square inch (psi).  The averag e peak case mouth pressure of the MK 244 cartridges at plus 70 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees F plus three (3) standard deviations of peak case mouth pressure shall not exceed 67,300 psi.  No individual MK 244 cartridge conditioned to plus 70 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees F shall have a peak case mouth pressure that exceeds 70,000 psi.  The average peak case mouth pressure of the MK 244 cartridges at minus 20 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees F shall not exceed 61,600 pounds per square inch (psi).  The average peak case mouth pressure of the MK 244 cartridges, conditioned to minus 20 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees F, plus three (3) standard deviations shall not exceed 67,300 psi.  No individual MK 244 cartridge, conditioned to minus 20 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees F, shall have a peak case mouth pressure that exceeds 70, 000 psi.  The average peak case mouth pressure of th e MK 244 cartridges at plus 130 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees F shall not exceed 65,400 pounds per square inch (psi).  The average peak case mouth pressure of the MK 244 cartridges, conditioned to plus 130 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees F, plus three (3) standard deviations shall not exceed 71,000 psi.  No individual MK 244 cartridge, conditioned to plus 130 degrees plus or minus 2 degrees F, shall have a peak case mouth pressure that exceeds 72,900 psi.   The loose filled or single compacted propellant must meet all of the performance requirements above while maintaining a flame temperature between 2600 and 2800 degrees K.  The flame temperature must be held within this interval in order to satisfy the Navy’s current barrel life expectancy of 10,000 rounds.

<SUBJECT>20 -- Fisheries Multibeam Imaging Sonar System
<DESC>This publication serves as a notice of intent to negotiate a sole source contract with Simrad U.S.A to provide multiple types of data during fisheries surveys.  The sonar needs to provide quantitative information about volume backscattering strength, surface scattering strength, and high-resolution bathymetric profiles.  The sonar must provide a 150 degree swath with 1.5 by 1.5 degree resolution at nadir, and an operational range of at least 300m.  Thus, the operational frequency must be 200 kHz or less.  The transducer head must be deployable to a depth of 3000m or mounted shallow on the hull or side of a ship.  A fairing for the sonar head, compatible with a pole-mount, must be provided.  The raw echo-intensity data must be available from the sonar in a well described and documented format.  The raw data provided from the sonar must be useful for quantitatively mapping the dispersion and relative abundance of pelagic sound scatterers, provide backscattering intensity data from the seafloor, and provide accurate ranges to the seafloor for each ping. Delivery date will be no more than 45 days from date of contract award.  To the best of the Government's knowledge and capability, there are no other companies that exist in the U.S. who can meet all needed requirements.  Simrad is the only known entity whose sonar provides digitized backscatter data from the time each sound pulse is emitted from the transducer head to the time the sound reflects off of the seafloor and returns to the transducer head.
