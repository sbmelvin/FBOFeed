Background and Justification:The Bureau of Reclamation is soliciting quotes for the removal of snow for the Animas La-Plata project located in Durango, CO, required during the upcoming winter season from December 1, 2010 through April 30, 2011.  Snow removal is required at numerous locations to ensure employee access to the main office building and field trailers, and to provide access to the pumping plant and dam site operations facilities to conduct daily inspection duties corresponding to pumping/filling functions associated with Lake Nighthorse reservoir or other miscellaneous construction activities.  Snow removal activities will be required at the 6 following locations;
1.  Main Office complex and parking area (Located at 103 Everette Street, Durango,2.  Durango Pumping Plant field trailers and parking area 3.  Durango Pumping Plant operations facility (Located northeast off New County      Road #CR210 - 4.

General Requirements:In general, snow removal from access roads and parking areas listed above will be required 24-hours per day 7-days per week throughout the duration of the service contract, unless waived by the government.  This removal will be required anytime snow accumulations on the ground exceed 4-inches, or upon notification by the government that slippery or slushy conditions do exist which present a potential safety concern regardless of the snow depth.  Severe weather conditions that persist resulting in snow accumulations of 4-inches or more being exceeded several times throughout the duration of a single storm event, may require subsequent snow removal trips.  Some sanding on icy/slick areas, especially hills, which present potential safety risks may be required to ensure safe passage.  Any subsequent snow removal requested by the government due to blown and drifting snow developing after completion of plowing activities between individual storm events, will be considered call back work and will be paid on an hourly basis for this type of additional work.
A firm-fixed price contract will be awarded resulting from Request for Quotation No. R11PS4L022 using procedures prescribed by FAR Part 12-Acquisition of Commercial items in conjunction with FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition, to be posted on or before October 20, 2010.

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has embarked on a series of programs aimed at revolutionizing the way defense systems and vehicles are made. Titled Adaptive Vehicle Make, the portfolio has three principal objectives: to dramatically compress development times for complex defense systems such as military air and ground vehicles, to shift the product value chain for such systems toward high-value-added design activities, and to democratize the innovation process. The Manufacturing Experimentation and Outreach (MENTOR) effort is part of the Adaptive Vehicle Make program portfolio and is aimed at engaging high school students in a series of collaborative distributed manufacturing and design experiments. The overarching objective of MENTOR is to develop and motivate a next generation cadre of system designers and manufacturing innovators, and to ensure that high school-age youths are exposed to the principles of modern prize-based design and foundry-style digital manufacturing. Refer to the attachment, "DARPA-BAA-11-19 MENTOR," for&nbsp;complete details of the BAA.

<DESC>DARPA previously released the META and META-II solicitations to develop model-based methods for the design, representation, and formal verification of complex military systems such as ground vehicles, airplanes, and rotorcraft in a "fab-less" environment. The present BAA looks to lay the groundwork for the development of a foundry-style manufacturing capability - taking as input a verified system design specified in an appropriate metalanguage - capable of rapid reconfiguration to accommodate a wide range of design variability and specifically targeted at the fabrication of military ground vehicles. For complete details of the BAA, see "iFAB BAA FINAL" attached to this announcement.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), National Institutes of Health (NIH) intends to solicit and negotiate on a non-competitive basis with only one source, the Coriell Institute for Medical Research.  Coriell is located at 403 Haddon Avenue Camden, NJ 08103.   The cited authorities are 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1 and HHSAR 306-302-1.  The anticipated period of performance is a one year base period with six one year option periods.   

Coriell was awarded a contract in 2006 on a non-competitive basis to perform as the NHGRI Sample Repository for Human Genetic Research.  For all of the samples that are already in the repository and that will be submitted to the repository over the next year, the consent forms explicitly state that the samples would be stored at the Coriell Institute and maintained at that facility for an indefinite period of time.  All of the samples collected were collected without names or other individual identifiers (anonymous), making it impossible now to return to the donors to seek a new consent allowing the samples to be maintained at a different facility.   The samples have been genotyped and sequenced and have become a valuable central resource for studies of disease and genetic variation, and are widely used by the broad scientific community.  Using new samples would lose the value of the hundreds of millions of dollars already invested in the genotyping, sequencing, and studies of these samples.  Thus, in order to duplicate the sample collection currently available at Coriell, NHGRI would have to collect new samples from the donor communities.  In addition, inherent duplication of costs to the Government and unacceptable delays in completing the project make competition unfeasible for this requirement.  As a result, this project will continue the collection, transformation, storage, maintenance, and distribution of human DNA samples and cell lines.  Coriell currently performs these functions which are used by many U.S. and international scientists who conduct research related to these projects or that builds on these projects.  NHGRI requires support for a Repository to perform the following basic work:  (1) store, maintain, and distribute cell lines and DNA samples, and clones from fosmid libraries, (2) transform samples into cell lines, and (3) maintain and store the HMP blood samples.

Organizations having demonstrated experience in performing the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements.  Capability statements must document the following: (1) ability to maintain, store, and distribute existing samples, DNA, and cell lines, (2) ability to work with groups collecting blood samples to facilitate the transfer of samples and taking in new samples (including cell lines from other places), establish and characterize permanent cell lines from these samples, and maintain and distribute these cell lines, (3) ability to prepare, store, and distribute high-quality DNA samples from cell lines, and distribute fosmid clones, (4) ability to maintain a computerized, comprehensive database providing detailed information on each cell line and DNA sample, and provide a web-based electronic catalog that lists the cell lines and DNA samples, any pre-formed sets of samples, and information about the samples in an easily accessible form, (5) ability to monitor compliance by requestors with policies on human subject protections and distribution of samples, (6) ability to publicize the repositorys collection, (7) ability to establish and maintain community outreach with the communities that provide the samples, and (8) ability to comply with other special requirements that may arise.

Capability statements submitted in response to this notice that do not provide sufficient information for review will not be considered.  This is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP), and responses should NOT include budgetary information.  Respondents to this notice shall provide capability statements (original and three copies) no later than 3:30pm EST on November 1, 2010 to the following address: National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Office of Acquisitions, Rockledge II  Room 6213, 6701 Rockledge Drive  MSC 7902, Bethesda, MD  20892-7902 (use 20817 for express mail), Attention: Kelli Broda, Contract Specialist. Capability statements may also be emailed (as a Word document or PDF) to Kelli Broda at: brodak@mail.nih.gov.

This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for the information provided in response.  The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate.  Respondents are advised that the Government is under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted.

 Box 498, Avenel, NJ 07001.  The contract will cover a five-year period and include estimated quantities of 60Hz Static Inverters, P/N 1-002-01012-2109 for the Special Projects Aircraft (SPA).  This requirement will be negotiated on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The basis for restricting competition is the lack of detailed drawings/specifications, test procedures and test stations in addition to duplicative costs and time that would be required to reverse engineer the systems.  Since this is a sole source procurement, a solicitation will not be posted to the internet.  Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency.
  It is the responsibility of the offeror to submit offers to the Point of Contact (POC) at NSWC Crane.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></span>. This is a Sources Sought request intended for all TSC II Lot I contractors, which are identified in the provided spreadsheet. Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD) is conducting market research to define a suitable acquisition strategy for upgrading two (2) Taiwan Army (TA) AH-1W simulators. These devices were manufactured by J.F. Taylor, Inc. and accepted for service in Mar 2003. The simulators are situated at Kuei Jen Army Air Base in Tainan, Taiwan.<br /><br />This advertisement stems from a TA requirement to maintain concurrency between AH-1W helicopters and associated simulators. Upgrades are currently being applied to the helicopters. Thus, to maintain training relevancy, a retrofit must occur to align the trainers with the operational aircraft. Other planned changes for the simulators include a refresh and re-host of the software and the replacement of obsolete and unsupportable hardware components. <br />The expected duration for this effort is expected to be 1 &frac12; years from contract award to final delivery, with each of the two (2) trainers being upgraded consecutively. On-site trainer modifications are expected to begin no later than five (5) months after contract. There is $2.5 million budgeted for this work. The accompanying file, entitled "AH-1W Taiwan SOW (Draft)," offers details and information that should be used to tailor responses.<br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br />RESPONSE FORMAT AND INSTRUCTIONS</strong></span>.

Interested vendors are encouraged to review the attached technical characteristic sheet that provides a high level summary of the Governments requirements.  It is requested that those interested submit a narrative, not to exceed ten (10) pages, detailing how their product meets the general characteristics noted.  Marketing brochures are acceptable but should be limited to only those that provide sufficient technical product details.
  No other information submitted will be used for purposes other than this RFI.

Submissions are due via email by 9:00 AM, Eastern, 11/1/10.

Submissions should be in Microsoft Office 2003, or greater, or Adobe Acrobat 8, or greater, file format.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  An Award will not be generated from this notice or any responses to this notice.<BR><BR>Statement of Need:  This is required to design, develop and deploy the inaugural infrastructure of laboratory instrumentation, analysis systems and services for human specimen chemistry and immunoassay testing for the diagnosis and treatment of DoD personnel and dependent beneficiaries in the combined medical center system (JTF CAPMED) of the National Capitol Region (NCR).  This objective of this is to define, design and acquire a standardized infrastructure of equipment, processes, systems, procedures and connectivity for human specimen chemistry and immunoassay laboratory instrumentation functionality across the NCR.  The primary objective in its design is to develop a design framework for similar systems at future laboratories within the NCR, so as to assure the interoperability of personnel and systems amongst all such facilities within the NCR.  The focus will be on laboratory automation to maximize turn-around-time (TAT) capabilities while minimizing hands-on manual technician involvement.  The design of the deployed infrastructure will be driven by a comprehensive (LSS/DFSS) analysis of required services, workflow process, and the overall concept of operations.  The design objective is to have every test to have a maximum TAT of 4 hours.  Where there are more stringent TAT Requirements for specific analytes and groups of analytes, individual analytes and groups of analytes, individual analytical systems and processes will be designed to satisfy these requirements with appropriate redundancies to ensure continuity of operations for Stat testing requirements.  <BR><BR>QUESTIONS:<BR>1.  Are there small business capabilities to provide and maintain the equipment as well as provide the support services?  <BR>2.  Are there small business subcontract capabilities?<BR>3.  Are there multiple IDIQ contract possibilities?  Can multiple companies provide identical equipment or equipment that is compatible with seamless transition from one system to another, all reporting to a single database utilizing the same testing standards?<BR>4.  Are there any specific questions or comments for the attached PWS?<BR>

<DESC>The United States Army Contracting Command, TACOM Contracting Center, intends to negotiate and award on a sole-source basis to SEA, Inc a contract for Vehicle Inertia Parameter Evaluation Rig II (VIPER II) for extra large Military vehicles.  This acquisition will acquire an enhanced characterization rig that will be capable of measuring center of gravity and mass moment of inertia measurements on all military vehicles.  The primary goal of this project is the design, development, and construction of the VIPER II. This system must work in concert with the current in-house Vehicle Inertia Parameter Evaluation Rig (VIPER) software on our VIPER hardware to produce collaborative output data in order to develop field-accurate vehicle models and to adequately predict in-field vehicle performance.  SEA, Ltd has proprietary rights to the VIPER and its software.  The goal is to improve the safety of tactical trucks and other critical vehicle systems.

<a href="mailto:amy.aguirre@smdc.army.mil">US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Deputy Commander</a>
<DESC>The Government has particular and urgent interest in technologies pertaining to and innovative solutions for Logistics Lift Airship design. The Logistics Lift Airship technologies development is urgently needed to enhance the capabilities of the Department of Defense in transporting personnel, supplies, equipment and other  materials to increasingly numerous and dispersed locations around the world to respond to any crisis.  The Logistics Airship technology development  is needed to support current and anticipated Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) challenges and emerging joint service operational concepts.<BR><BR>The Government is interested in receiving White Papers (as described in Paragraph 6.a. of the Broad Agency Announcement) NLT 22 October 2010 for a Logistics variant of Hybrid Airship/Airship designs that can augment existing theater transportation delivery capabilities while minimizing transportation risks and cost. <BR><BR>Specific Areas of Interest include propulsion systems, lightweight high-strength airship materials, vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, airship landing systems for ground winds up to 80 knots, innovative methods for cargo handling including a roll-on roll-off and winching system cargo bay for use in austere and unimproved locations and onboard manned flight control and navigation systems.<BR><BR>Hybrid Airship/Airships designs must be capable of transporting greater than or equal to 40,000 pounds of flexible payload (vehicles, pallets, litters, personnel, etc.) at altitudes greater than or equal to 10,000 feet mean sea level (MSL) with a cruise speed greater than or equal to 80 knots and have a range of at least 1000 nautical miles. <BR><BR>The Government is seeking to enhance performance and reliability of Logistics Lift Airship technologies. White Papers should address technical and scientific development in the Technology area of Space Augmentation under High Altitude Platforms and Power Systems and Propulsion (paragraphs 4.g.(1) and 4.g.(3) of the BAA) as they apply to a Logistics Lift Airship. The White Papers should describe the proposed system architectures in such a way as to help the Government assess the technology in terms of potential size, weight, power efficiency, power generation, maturity, hull shape, operational effectiveness, affordability, reliability, maintainability, supportability, environmental acceptability, concept of operations, risks, ruggedness, interoperability, Air worthiness and flight certification procedures. The White Papers should identify critical technologies needing further development to enable a Logistics Lift Airship to meet the general requirements.<BR><BR>In order to receive optimum consideration, the White Papers must be received by 22 October 2010. The Government may request full proposals for promising concepts that may result in the award of multiple Cost Plus Fixed Fee contracts with a Base Period value of approximately $150,000 and a contract value (Base and all options) of up to $49M. The government reserves the right to make some or no awards and to request revisions to contractor proposals and statements of work including requests for clarification, risk mitigation plans, changes to proposed period of performance, Contract Data Requirements List (CDRL) requirements or other changes as necessary to better align with the United States Army Space Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command (USASMDC/ ARSTRAT) mission.<BR><BR>The maximum Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for any effort to be performed under a contract awarded pursuant to the BAA is TRL Level 6.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
The solicitation number for this request is F11PS00010 and is issued as a request for quote (RFQ). The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC 05-46) and Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).
This procurement is a small business set-aside. The applicable NAICS classification code is 336611 with size standard of 1,000 employees and PSC code is J999. 
SCOPE OF WORKThe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is requesting quotes for rebuilding/repairing two Caterpillar engines, series (3412) with a rated Horsepower of 425. The serial# for the port engine is 60M02792, AR# 1W0733 and for the starboard engine is 60M02794, AR # is 1W0733 from the M/V Tiglax located in the Homer, AK small boat harbor.
BackgroundM/V Tiglax is a 120 foot science support vessel owned and operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and has a home port of the small boat harbor at Homer, Alaska.  More information on the vessel can be found at: http://alaskamaritime.fws.gov/tiglax.htm.   
This scope of work entails rebuilding/repairing two Caterpillar engines, series (3412) with a rated Horsepower of 425. The serial# for the port engine is 60M02792, AR# 1W0733 and for the starboard engine is 60M02794, AR # is 1W0733 from the M/V Tiglax located in the Homer, AK small boat harbor.
Both of the engines have 17,000 hours/meter units since the last rebuild. The port main developed a pinhole coolant leak between the water jacket and the crankcase in the area of #4 cylinder. The leak is currently stopped with automotive stop-leak. The starboard engine has no known problems other than high hours.
Description of WorkThe contractor shall provide all labor and materials necessary to complete the repair/rebuild of two Caterpillar engines listed above. Any materials or services furnished by the Government have been clearly stated within this scope of work. The contractor shall travel to the vessel's home port of Homer, Alaska to perform all services required.
The contractor shall dismantle and rebuild both the starboard and port engines. All engine parts can be removed through the engine room access hatch and then removed from the ship via the deck hatches that provide access to outside the ship. The old parts and new parts can be put on and off the ship via the Homer Fish dock by using city cranes operated by the FWS crew, if necessary. Pad eyes may need to be welded onto the engine room overhead to assist in the removal of the old heavy engine parts. Should the pad eyes become necessary, FWS will provide the hot work and fire watches.  
The contractor will provide all materials, labor, and tools necessary to rebuild the engines. The contractor shall, at a minimum the following install new or remanufactured parts:-crankshaft-camshaft (after inspection confirms need for replacement) -Injector pump -water pump-oil pump-cylinder heads-turbo charger cartridge-fuel transfer pump-power packs (i.e. pistons, connecting rods, piston rings, wrist pins, liners) -rocker assemblies- intercooler -vibration dampers-engine gasket set- seals-timing gears -head bolts-head divider plates-push rods-bearings -hour meter-adapters
All parts that are to be reused will be cleaned by the contractor. Upon cleaning, FWS personnel will inspect and approve the reused parts for reinstallation. Once the parts are approved for reuse, the contractor shall reinstall according to manufacturer specifications. The contractor is not responsible for painting the engine upon completion of the job. The contractor shall ensure proper disposal of all unused/damaged/removed parts, as well as any cleaning solvents as a result of the engine rebuild. 
The contractor shall provide two (port & starboard) satisfactory operating engines in accordance with manufacturer specifications. Therefore, any parts necessary to meet this standard shall be included in the contractor's quote. Please note the existing injectors were installed in the winter of 2010 and are presumed to be in good working order. The contractor shall use the existing injectors in the new engines.
It is imperative that the contractor begins rebuilding/repairing the port engine first, as it is the engine needing critical repairs. The engines will need to be moved forward from the reduction gear on the engine beds. This process movement could damage the existing chockfast. FWS personnel will determine the need for this repair. If the chockfast is found damaged, a modification shall be issued by the Contracting Officer prior to the contractor proceeding with this repair or any other additional work. The FWS personnel will provide the adapters to move the engine.  
After each engine has been rebuilt, FWS will perform a dockside test of the engine, followed by a 2-4 hour sea trial. FWS will provide and replace all fluids (inclusive of coolant and oil) necessary for these tests.
**NOTE**If the contractor and COTR agreed that the port side and/or starboard side engine blocks cannot be repaired, new blocks will be required. Should the blocks need to be replaced, the replacement blocks may be new or remanufactured parts. If it is necessary, FWS will use the shore side city cranes alongside the city dock to remove the engine blocks from the ship. It is at this point, the contractor has the responsibility to dispose of the block(s) properly. If the blocks are found to be non-repairable, a modification shall be issued by the Contracting Officer prior to the contractor proceeding with this replacement or any other additional work.
Period of PerformanceWork shall begin by November 22, 2010 and to be completed no later than January 10, 2011. The period of performance shall be increased by the number of days identified for each of the optional line items exercised.
Optional Site VisitThe ship and its engine room will be available for a site visit prior to the solicitation closing period. Offerors are encouraged to visit the vessel, but not required. Site visits are only available October 25, 2010 or October 26, 2010 between the hours of 9am and 4pm. Requests for dates and times other than these will not be accepted.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITIONOver $100,000 1.	Identification of the Agency and the Contracting Activity:Department of the InteriorNational Park ServiceJoshua Tree National ParkTwentynine Palms, CA 92277
2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Approved:This project is in response to a continual abuse, misuse and climatic impacts affecting the maintainability and life cycle costs associated with maintaining the comfort stations and recycling bins throughout the visitor use areas of the park.  After maintenance cost analysis and environmental impact considerations associated with the repetitive painting, epoxy and cleaning of the comfort stations and recycling bins were considered, it has been determined that environmental and economical impacts would be reduced by applying a hardened, UV tolerant, graffiti resistant and fire proof coating to the comfort stations and recycling bins. The work being accomplished will reduce the maintenance hours to half that normally involved in the repair and daily maintenance associated with these visitor related assets. This application reduces the water use associated with cleaning the stations by nearly 2/3. LineX is the only company providing the required surface protection application of a two part coating in a manner that is free of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) & Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and meets all requirements for initial application in a manner that protects the fragile environment and vegetation in proximity to the assets. As a primary visitor amenity, it is imperative that the down time for maintenance of these assets is kept to a minimum. Presently, when a comfort station is damaged due to graffiti or fire, the particular station may be closed for up to a week at each occurrence. Some are not repaired due to the inability to take them out of service for that length of time, thus contributing to the deferred maintenance back log at the park. This project will provide a hardened protective coating to all comfort stations and recycling bins throughout the park extending the service life & reducing deferred maintenance, operational expenses and water usage.
3.	A Description of the Supplies or services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs, Including the Estimated Value:LineX will prepare the comfort stations and recycling bins by stripping all surfaces to bare materials using environmental containment to ensure surface areas and outside areas are protected. LineX will apply the SE515 Primer, XS-AG2010 Anti-Graffiti & SE252 Fire Rated coatings in all comfort stations and SE515 Primer, XS-AG2010 Anti Graffiti & XS100 hardened coatings to all recycling bins in accordance with all precautions to ensure a VOC and CFC free application, conforming to federal air quality standards. All surfaces will be completely free of surface defects in the coating. Each comfort station will be completed from start to finish in no more than 48 hours. The total number of comfort stations to be prepped and coated is 62 single stall units and 21 double stall units. No individual facility will be out of order for more than 48 hours unless weather conditions prevent proper application of the coatings. The total number of recycling bins to be prepped and coated is 27. The Scope of Work includes an estimate of $310,000 which is backed by a 15 year unconditional warranty including UV color fastness and surfacing durability.
4.	An Identification of the Statutory Authority Permitting Other Than Full and Open Competition: FAR 6.302-1(c) Application for Brand Name Descriptions 
5.	A Demonstration That the Proposed Contractor's Unique Qualifications or the Nature of the Acquisition Requires Use of the Authority Cited:
A number of coating systems have been tested by the park in the extremely harsh heat and cold environments of the Mojave Desert. In the summer, temperatures can reach above 120 degrees F inside the comfort stations and over 150 degrees F inside the recycling bins. Adding the humidity of stored liquids in both areas increases the corrosive effect on the coatings. During the winter, temperatures drop below freezing as well. The drastic temperature differences have caused all previous coatings to separate from the materials that they are adhered to. LineX is the only product to prove that it can and does perform exceptionally in this application. LineX applies the only product that has been able to withstand the harsh elements and stand up to the abuse of graffiti and daily use. Very often (5 times a year on average) campers will start fires inside the comfort stations to get out of the extreme wind and warm up. The LineX product SE252 used to provide the fire resistance needed in the comfort stations and recycling bins to ensure reduced maintenance, is the only fire rated coating to pass both of the certifications (E84 & ASTM 162) required by the coatings industry to be used on public facilities. SE252 is also the only fire rated coating in the industry that when a fire is started on the SE252 coating no discolor, fading or damage occurs allowing for immediate reuse of the facility after a simple washing. LineX provides an unconditional 15 year warranty for the surfacing coatings regardless of abuse, vandalism and/or the elements (the only manufacturer to do so). All previous coatings used at the park have required approximately 5-7 days preparing the surfaces, applying the products and curing the coatings before they can be reopened for public use. The LineX preparation and application process is completed and allows the facilities to be used within 48 hours. The 48 hour downtime is a key benefit as the facilities must be available for visitor use every weekend (Friday-Monday) as JOTR is a year-round Fee collecting park and campsite reservations are made sometimes up to a year in advance. 
6.	A Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers Are Solicited From as Many Potential Sources as is Practicable, Including Whether a Notice Was or Will Be Publicized as Required by FAR Subpart 5.2 and, If Not, Which Exception Under FAR 5.202 Applies:
The current procurement to provide coatings that will be graffiti proof, fire proof, Non CFC and VOC containing applications will be synopsized in accordance with FAR 5.102(a)(6), which states that the justification shall be uploaded for electronic review with the solicitation package.  
7.	A Determination by the Contracting Officer That the Anticipated Cost to the Government Will Be Fair and Reasonable:
A review of catalog or internet pricing of the competition would provide back-up documentation that the pricing received from LineX is fair and reasonable.  Furthermore, LineX is the product manufacturer, thus saving money over working with a third party. The initial cost average of $2818 per unit is recovered in 32 months due to the labor for repairs, operational decreases, vehicle travel and water usage reductions. 



8.	A Description of the Market Research Conducted (see FAR Part 10) and the Results or a Statement of the Reason Market Research Was Not Conducted:
JOTR tested 6 different products for durability and operational maintainability; EVR-GARD Coating Walkapon 100% Acrylic Floor Coating, BEHR 1 Part Epoxy Acrylic Paint, BEHR Concrete & Garage Floor Paint, Do-It-Better Interior Acrylic Latex Semi Gloss Enamel, BEHR Masonry Stucco and Brick Coating (Self Priming) and Kilz Acrylic Touch Up. JOTR performed a demonstration test with LineX on a single vault comfort station in 2009. The application performed by LineX is still as new in the most often used facility in the park. JOTR contacted 3 other coating companies seeking market competition. Each of the companies contacted expressed that they could not provide the same level of protection for the various coatings and none would warranty the product after application. -	Speedliner, 800-821-8820, Houston, Texas had no anti-graffiti, fire rating protection or color stability. -	Xtreme Liner, 281-795-5916, Houston, Texas could not provide any product that would meet the requirements. Xtreme Liner referred us to Urethane Solutions.-	Urethane Solutions, 949-595-4009, Irvine, CA has a fire "retardant" coating but stated that the coating will burn and discolor if a flame is applied to the coating. This company has no anti-graffiti or color stable (UV resistant) products. The company would only warranty the application of the protective coating. The company would not provide a warranty for damage to the coating resulting from abuse or extreme environmental conditions.
9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition (see FAR 6.302-2 (9) (i) - (iii) for some examples):
In accordance with FAR 6.302-1(c), An acquisition that uses a brand name description or other purchase description to specify a particular brand name, product, or feature of a product, peculiar to one manufacturer does not provide for full & open competition regardless of the number of sources solicited.   The above description is essential to the Government's requirements, thereby precluding consideration of a product manufactured by another company.  
10.	 A Listing of the Sources, If Any, That Expressed in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition: NONE
11.	 A Statement of the Actions, If Any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome Any Barriers to Competition Before Any Subsequent Acquisition for the Supplies or Services Required: NONE

OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />Proposal Submission Place:<br />Santiago Piedrahita Tabares<br />Director for International Cooperation And Business<br />Instituto Para El Desarrollo De Antioquia (Idea)<br />Calle 42 No. 52-259<br />Medellin, Colombia<br />Phone: +57 4 381 9129</p>
<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study to determine the technical, economic and financial viability of a 20 MW waste-to-energy plant near the city of Medell&iacute;n in the Colombian department of Antioquia.</p>
<p>The Instituto para el Desarollo de Antioquia, the Institute for the Development of Antioquia (IDEA), requested a USTDA grant for a feasibility study to determine the technical, economic and financial viability of a 20 MW waste-to-energy plant near the city of Medell&iacute;n in the Colombian department of Antioquia. IDEA is the autonomous regional development institution in Antioquia and has participated in the development of numerous energy, infrastructure, mining and reforestation projects.</p>
<p>The WTE plant would be fueled by the collected urban and industrial wastes from five municipalities south of Medell&iacute;n that are currently deposited at the "El Guacal" landfill in the Municipality of Heliconia, about 25 km from Medell&iacute;n. The WTE plant is anticipated to be sited on the property of the El Guacal landfill, which is owned and operated by EVAS Enviambientales, S.A. E.S.P. (EVAS). EVAS is responsible for the treatment and final disposition of solid waste at the El Guacal landfill and is licensed for 24 years to receive, select and process ordinary and special solid waste and mud. EVAS is a sanitary and landfill operator company in Colombia, fully owned by the Municipality of Envigado, but which serves much of the southern Aburr&aacute; Valley area in Antioquia.</p>
<p>The waste processing and power generation facility will input the roughly 650 tons per day of municipal solid waste (MSW) presently deposited at the EVAS landfill and convert it to roughly 400 tons of refuse-derived fuel for the generation of approximately 20 MW of electricity. With collection and landfill deposits well managed by EVAS, these wastes have been studied and classified, confirming a sufficient calorific value with a steady and continuous daily flow. The owner and operator for the proposed WTE plant is presently anticipated to be a joint venture (JV) between IDEA, the Municipality of Envigado, and possibly a private sector engineering firm.</p>
<p>The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $573,039 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report, is available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. <br />To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:</p>

<p>Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt.

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate</p>
<p>peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided</p>
<p>that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The Transition Specialist position utilizes the experience and skills gained from working with political transition programs and operations in the field to provide support and guidance for program funded staff and to help ensure successful implementation of program funded transition activities in the field.</p>
<p>The majority of the workload of this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation. In order to help ensure successful political transitions overseas in rapidly changing environments, the Transition Specialist will ensure that OTI staff, implementing partner staff, and other key players have the information and training they need to start up new programs, seek out and work with appropriate beneficiaries in the field, and manage and close out activities effectively and efficiently. The vast majority of the workload for this position will be in direct support of political transition program implementation</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The objective of this solicitation is to provide a full-time Transition Specialist to the Office of Transition Initiatives.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>
<p>The Transition Specialist priorities are expected to change and evolve in accordance with the requirements of OTI and will be determined in consultation with and under the direct supervision of the Washington-based DCHA/OTI Chief of Field Programs Division or his or her designee.</p>
<p>Under the supervision of the DCHA/OTI Chief of Field Programs Division, the Washington-based Transition Specialist will perform the following duties:</p>
<p>&bull; Fill critical program implementation staffing needs in Washington, D.C. and the field including providing support to new OTI country program start-ups, country program management and close-out, and providing on-call technical assistance in support of OTI transition programs. In collaboration with the relevant OTI Regional Team, conduct or assist with assessments for possible new country programs and fill staffing gaps for ongoing country programs;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide training and mentoring on OTI program implementation for OTI staff and implementing partners both in Washington and the field, and assist in the development and updating of training materials as required. This includes training and/or advising implementing partners on internal OTI business procedures (such as for the OTI Activity Database and the Grants Under Contract (GUC) process);</p>
<p>&bull; Provide technical assistance for OTI programs and beneficiaries in the field, and also advise OTI staff and implementing partners on business processes in relation to implementation of political transition programming;</p>
<p>&bull; When required within the guidelines provided by the OTI Regional Team, discuss and assist in determining program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts. This also may include assessing the adequacy of potential local partners in collaboration with OTI staff and/or OTI implementing partner organizations;</p>
<p>&bull; Coordinate with and assist other OTI teams (Operations and Management Division, Program Office) in the development of information management products and improved business practices, as well as the development of mechanisms for the dissemination of such products to OTI field staff and implementing partners. Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Assist in the conceptualization and design, as required, of country program strategies and objectives, in close coordination with OTI staff, other USAID, and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy;</p>
<p>&bull; Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to key players (select visitors, officials from international organizations, bilateral donors, and national and local foreign government officials). When required, serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions, and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, USG agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide other services as required to fulfill OTI's program objectives.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Transition Specialist will take direction from and will report to the Chief of Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>10. PHYSICAL DEMANDS</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country's political process.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its objectives and mandates OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts. These knowledgeable and skilled professionals are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives and must be prepared to work both in Washington and the field, often with little time for preparations.</p>
<p>The OTI Senior Transition Specialist position was developed to allow OTI to take advantage of the accumulated experience of field staff following closure of the country program(s) which they managed. As OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and facilitate earlier consideration of countries that face possible political crises, having access to individuals with hands-on experience in transition programming will enhance our ability to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints, and be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.</p>
<p>OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>To hire qualified personnel to provide expertise in transition programming.</p>
<p>9. CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES</p>

<p>Duties and Responsibilities</p>
<p>The Senior Transition Specialist priorities are expected to change and evolve in accordance with the requirements of OTI and will be determined in consultation with and under the direct supervision of the Washington-based Democracy, Conflict and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Chief of Field Programs Division or his or her designee.

<p>&bull; Execute, if required, closeout activities related to OTI programs, and provide technical assistance to ongoing evaluations of OTI programs in the field;</p>
<p>&bull; When required, negotiate, within the guidelines provided by the OTI Chief, FPD, or his/her designee, program and project agreements with governmental and non-governmental counterparts;</p>
<p>&bull; Analyze and report on current political developments and security concerns as well as other pertinent information required to achieve OTI's program objectives;</p>
<p>&bull; Conceptualize and design country program strategies and objectives in close coordination with OTI staff, USAID and U.S. Department of State personnel, and other governmental and non-governmental actors, based on political analysis and U.S. Government policy. When necessary, assist in refining strategic objectives and advocate on behalf of new programmatic approaches in-country, possibly linked to neighboring country programs if considered appropriate;</p>
<p>&bull; Represent and articulate OTI's mission and global programs to visitors, senior officials from international organizations, bilateral donors and national and local foreign government officials;</p>
<p>&bull; Identify or seek out NGOs, international donors, U.S. Government (USG) agencies and other organizations of importance to OTI programs in Washington and the field, and develop and maintain professional relationships with them;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise and/or assist in drafting documents outlining future planning and vision in the development and implementation of OTI programs, and assist in developing and improving country program monitoring and evaluation systems, providing guidance on designing and managing final evaluations;</p>
<p>&bull; Advise Senior Management and Team Leaders on budget processes and reviews, preparing justification documentation when necessary;</p>
<p>&bull; Update and revise, as needed, program management guides, including strategic planning and field operations materials;</p>
<p>&bull; Serve as a liaison with other DCHA offices, other USAID divisions and the State Department on program and policy direction;</p>
<p>&bull; Help ensure that OTI's programs and their activities are monitored and evaluated and that lessons learned from the activities feed into ongoing or future activities;</p>
<p>&bull; Ensure appropriate resource allocation among OTI field offices and implementing partners;</p>
<p>&bull; Provide other services as required to fulfill OTI's program objectives.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY RELATIONSHIP:<br />The Senior Transition Specialist will take direction from and will report to OTI's Chief of Field Programs Division or his/her designee.</p>
<p>SUPERVISORY CONTROLS:<br />The Supervisor will set overall objectives. The employee and the supervisor together will develop deadlines, projects, and work to be accomplished. The incumbent is expected to take initiative, act independently, and manage his/her tasks with minimal supervision.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC>This amendment is issued to provide answers to questions received and extend the due date for quotes.&nbsp; The new date for quotes is September 27, 2010 at 12 noon.<br /><br /><br />1 )Could the Government please advise how many administrators would require 2-factor authentication access to the virtual environment to manage the IaaS infrastructure? It is common that there is a per-user charge.
<p>FCC requires four FCC administrators to have 2-factor authentication, or other sufficient level of authentication and system access to the virtual environment to manage the IaaS infrastructure.</p>
<p><br />2) Also, could the Government please advise on a projected number of virtual servers that would be deployed in the virtual environment. There are a few security services, required to meet the FISMA compliance, that are based on a count or range of virtual servers deployed.</p>
<p>Virtual servers deployed would range between 3 (three) and 8 (eight) with occasional temporary usage of more. We anticipate the usage to be generally in the single digit number of servers. Vendor should describe any specific per-virtual cost associated with a range of virtual servers. For example, if there are FISMA compliance related charges based on a range of virtual servers deployed, vendor should include in a description of such charges and how they are priced per virtual or service or across a range of virtual servers.</p>

<p><br />U.S. COAST GUARD<br />HU-25 AUXILIARY POWER UNIT REPAIR<br />STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES</p>
<p>1.0 BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) currently operates thirteen (13) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel. These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments. The Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) model GTCP36-100C is a gas turbine engine, which is essentially a self-contained power source providing pneumatic and rotational shaft power. The APU provides AC/DC electrical power for the HU-25 aircraft systems prior to engine start or during selected emergency procedures. It also provides a pneumatic source for the operation of environmental systems during ground operations. APU's and their subcomponents are serial number tracked under the Coast Guard's Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS). This tracking provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, maintenance, and item location and status. It also provides an effective method of configuration control. History has shown the APU to be highly reliable, with the exception of internal oil seals leaking oil in to the gas path. Otherwise, little more is required than scheduled maintenance and inspections. The APU requires repair following: 2700 airframe operating hours, Foreign Object Damage (FOD), internal oil leaks, or mechanical failure beyond the scope of normal line maintenance.</p>
<p>2.0 OBJECTIVE</p>
<p>The Coast Guards objective is to obtain the services of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to repair and provide complete, ready-to-install GTCP36-100C APU's for the HU-25 that are certified for flight with an FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness document. A Certificate of Conformance (COC) may be substituted for the FAA 8130-3 only if the COC is deemed acceptable by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard desires a Turn-Around-Time of no greater than 180 days from time of material receipt at contractor's facility to prevent Aircraft On Ground (AOG) supply issues.</p>
<p>3.0 REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>A. Repaired APU's must comply with the current Original Equipment Manufacturer's (OEM) specifications, drawings, Service Bulletins, and performance requirements as set forth in the OEM technical specifications. The offeror is responsible for all necessary functions to perform the services requested. This includes, but is not limited to; required tooling, test equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, serviceable and non-serviceable parts storage, preservation, packaging, shipping, etc, to repair GTCP36-100C APU's. Packaging and preservation shall be in accordance with (IAW) maintenance manual GTCP36-100C chapter 49-20-00, Engine Servicing, step 2, dated 03 Sept. 1985.</p>
<p>The offeror's responsibilities to Coast Guard ACMS consist of ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component. Configuration of the APU must be maintained by ensuring that all OEM Service Bulletins remain incorporated.</p>
<p>Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract. The Coast Guard Aviation Logistics Center (ALC) MRS Product Line and the winning offeror will baseline and monitor progress using agreed-to performance metrics and service level agreements.</p>
<p>B. To meet the Coast Guard's objectives the offeror will be required to meet the following criteria:</p>
<p>1. Technical</p>
<p>a. Either possess or show ability to obtain adequate technical data, tooling, fixtures and parts to meet current OEM specifications as referenced in paragraph 3.0.A.<br />b. Provide a written Performance Metrics Plan.<br />c. Provide evidence of, and ability to maintain, a Quality System acceptable to the Coast Guard.</p>
<p>2. Past Performance</p>
<p>a. Provide documentation of having performed repair of similar or like items.<br />Provide Points of Contact for past performance documentation for the past two years. Include references' name, company, phone number, and e-mail address. <br /><br />4.0 Service Bulletins: <br />All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting Officer. The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins. Upon receipt of an APU requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a firm fixed price proposal IAW instructions listed below. Service bulletins created and incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number configurations, which supercede the previous configuration. In cases where the old configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number may be added to the contract. The contractor shall notify and request disposition instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and replaced by new part number configurations.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component. The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups. The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated. Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated. When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the contract. The same procedures apply if removal of service bulletins is required.<br />5.0 APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS: The following Technical Specifications are applicable:<br />GTCP36-100C chapter 49-20-00, Engine Servicing, step 2., dated 03 Sept. 1985.<br />6.0 Government Furnished Property:<br />One (1) APU Harness, P/N 3888080 will be provided to contractor for testing of APU's.<br />7.0 Data availability:<br />7.1.1 OEM Technical data, Service Bulletins, drawings and specifications are proprietary and cannot be provided by the U.S. Coast guard.<br />The GFP will be returned to the Coast Guard in Ready For Issue (RFI) condition should the contract be terminated, cancelled, or expire.</p>
<p>The following Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) and Homeland Security Acquisition Regulation (HSAR) Provisions and Clauses Apply:<br />52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items. (June 2008) <br />52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999) <br />Evaluation Factors: The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose proposal is identified as offering the best value solution. The best value for the Coast Guard may merit a higher price based on technical superiority. Using sound business judgment, the government will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal's relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:</p>
<p>Factor 1 - Technical/Management Solution/Approach<br />Factor 2 - Performance Measures and Metrics<br />Factor 3 - Past Performance<br />Factor 4 - Cost/Price</p>
<p>Factor 1 and Factor 2 are equal and each is significantly more important than Factor 3. While the Cost/Price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the non-Cost/price factors are significantly more important than the Cost/Price factor. Cost/price will become increasingly important as proposal evaluation rating for technical factors approach equal.</p>
<p>DETAILED FACTORS</p>
<p>Factor 1: Technical Management/Solution/Approach</p>
<p>The technical/management solution/approach will be evaluated for its quality and evidence of extent to which Contractor's solutions will achieve Coast Guard objectives of auxiliary power unit (APU) and component part refurbishment (repair). The evaluation will include an assessment that the solution adheres to sound engineering, design and management practices and that the Contractor has a complete understanding of the objectives, constraints and is customer focused. Evidence of the quality of the technical management /solution/approach includes:</p>
<p>(a) A comprehensive performance work statement and contract breakdown structure that identifies the services to be implemented to meet the program and mission requirements set forth in the statement of objectives.</p>
<p>(b) A sound technical proposal that clearly demonstrates how implementation of the proposed solutions will deliver timely, stable, reliable, secure, flexible, responsive, compliant and cost effective services.</p>
<p>(c) A sound partnering approach to management that demonstrates the ability to aggressively identify and apply information technology solutions to business processes. The management approach needs to provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Highly qualified and experienced key personnel with a proven track record of success in providing large enterprise-wide managed services under performance based arrangements.<br />&bull; Clear lines of communication between the Contractor's team and the Coast Guard for timely problem identification, mitigation and resolution.<br />&bull; Active and continuing participation and involvement of senior corporate executives in ensuring the success of this program.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor's validated process and procedures that ensure high quality performance. i.e. ISO 9000 type or other quality certifications, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) required service bulletins, FAA 8130-3 Flight Worthiness Document or COC.</p>
<p>Factor 2: Performance Measures and Metrics</p>
<p>The offered performance metrics and service level agreements will be evaluated for the extent they are:</p>
<p>(a) Comprehensive in their ability to quantify, measure, track and report operational performance relating to both system and management performance as well as achievement of Coast Guard objectives.<br />(b) Identifying the highest level of service consistent with cost effectiveness<br />(c) Tied to performance incentives and disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.</p>
<p>Factor 3: Past Performance</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will examine how the Contractor's past and present performance validates expected performance and customer satisfaction. The Coast Guard may use data obtained from other sources to conduct the past performance assessment, as well as that provided in the quotation.</p>
<p>The past performance evaluation will also examine the Contractor's actual performance on repair of similar or like items. This review will focus on the scope and complexity of the efforts, the performance measures/service levels applied, and the actual results achieved against those measures.</p>
<p>Factor 4: Cost/Price</p>
<p>Each Contractor's cost/price proposal will be evaluated based on the following:</p>
<p>(a) Evaluation of proposed price/cost.</p>
<p>(b) Reasonableness: Reasonableness will be established by the existence of adequate price competition and by comparing all, or a representative sample of the proposed prices/costs to industry average rates and/or rates from other contracts for similar work, etc.</p>
<p>(c) Realism: If applicable, a realism assessment will be accomplished by technical review and evaluation of the skill mix, specific hours, material kinds and quantity for reach identified CLIN/SubCLIN in the contractor's proposed cost/price proposal. The intent of the evaluation is to determine whether the estimated proposed price/cost elements are realistic for the work to be performed; reflect a clear understanding of the requirements; and are consistent with the approach described in the Contractor's technical proposal.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<p>8. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries. Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.</p>
<p>Stabilization programming in Afghanistan is one of the United States Government's top priorities. This program will actively work to support counterinsurgency operations, development in crisis prone areas of the country, and the Afghan government.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>USAID/OTI launched a new program in Afghanistan in July 2009, in line with U.S. Government (USG) priorities. The program implements civilian-run stabilization projects in targeted areas, during the shape, clear and hold phases of counterinsurgency (COIN) operations. The program seeks to engage community and government leaders, mitigate conflict and create space for longer term development projects. In addition, the program will support the legitimacy and capacity of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) to plan for and implement a sustained civilian stabilization response.</p>
<p>USAID/OTI, through its implementing partners manages an operational platform and an in-kind small grants mechanism aimed at promoting the objectives described above. Activities focus on stability assistance, which incorporates a range of sectors, including, but not limited to, irrigation and small infrastructure, potable water schemes, road repairs, repairs to public facilities such as schools, agricultural terraces, and small livelihood activities. All activities are community driven and strive to address sources of instability which often includes increasing the legitimacy of GIRoA.</p>

Applicants must be cautious: those who submit an application for the GS-14 grade level, but do not meet the minimum qualifications as reviewed by the Technical Evaluation Panel (TEC) will not be considered for the GS-13 position if they have not submitted a separate application for the GS-13 position.

<p>Qualified individuals are required to submit:</p>
<p>1. A complete U.S. Government Optional Form 612 with hand-written signature (including OF-612 continuation sheets as needed) (downloadable forms are available on the USAID website, http://www.usaid.gov/forms, or internet http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/formslibrary.do, or www.globalcorps.com).</p>
<p>NOTE: Submission of a resume in addition to the required forms is encouraged. A submitted resume, however, is considered supplemental application material. Submission of a resume alone or in lieu of the OF-612 form IS NOT a complete application. All information to be evaluated must be contained in the OF-612 form and must not depend on references to your resume. Failure to provide the required information and/or materials will result in your not being considered for employment.</p>
<p>All applicants must submit complete dates (months/years) and hours per week for all positions listed on the OF-612 or on supplemental OF-612 continuation sheets to allow for adequate evaluation of your direct and related experience. Experience that cannot be quantified will not be counted towards meeting the solicitation requirements.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16<br />FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/c23002.htm.</p>
<p>Note: Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below. The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment. Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad. The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy. When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation." In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance. The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section. The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below. In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred. In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member. In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization. The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision. The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521. When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies. As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less. If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs. If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

<DESC><p>The United States Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) intends to issue a Request for Proposal, FA9422-11-R-000x (number to be determined), to acquire technology demonstrations related to Nuclear Enterprise Tracking System (NETS). The purpose of this posting is to request Statements of Capabilities (SOC) to assist in finalizing the acquisition strategy and to update industry on the schedule for this potential requirement.<br /><br />At this time, the AFNWC respectfully requests interested parties provide a SOC (not to exceed 8 pages) no later than 2:00 pm (MST) on 26 Oct 10. The information the government gains in reviewing/evaluating these SOCs will be used in determining if the acquisition will be accomplished through full and open competition or become a small business set-aside using NAICS Code 541712. Therefore, we would appreciate all interested parties who intend to bid as a prime participate in providing a SOC. This SOC should provide information that demonstrates the company has a clear understanding and in-depth knowledge of Air Force processes currently used for asset tracking and a knowledge and understanding of current Air Force logistics information systems, especially as it relates to tracking nuclear parts/components. Specifically, demonstrate your company has the expertise to provide real-time local/corporate command and control in tracking nuclear components and the ability to integrate a new technology that will interface with the existing nuclear parts/components and asset tracking systems (secure and unsecure side), such as the Air Force Global Information Grid (AF-GIG), Reliability and Maintainability Information System (REMIS), Integrated Maintenance Data System (IMDS), Standard Base Supply System (SBSS), Combat Ammunition System (CAS), and Defense Integration and Management of Nuclear Data Services (DIAMONDS). Any listing of past contract efforts to demonstrate expertise in some or all of these areas is appreciated. It is not anticipated that a single company would have expertise in all the areas listed so please identify what areas you have past experience in and, if you can at this time, demonstrate if any shortfalls would be subcontracted and write a brief description of your subcontractors expertise. The SOC should also contain information demonstrating if your company has the ability to handle Secret and Top Secret level information. Electronic submissions are accepted and preferred. Submit to: Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center/PKE, 8150 "F" Ave., Bldg 20226, Rm. 9, Kirtland AFB, NM 87117 or to Francine.chavez2@kirtland.af.mil.<br /><br />We received a wealth of questions from Industry from the posting of the draft Statement of Objectives. We will provide responses to industry (thru a FedBizOps posting) by the end of October 2010 or sooner. Shortly thereafter, we will provide a draft RFP for industry comment. <br /><br />This is a presolicitation notice and is not a request for competitive proposals.</p>
<p>Information herein is based on the best information available at the time of publication, is subject to revision, and is not binding on the Government. The Government will not recognize any cost associated with submission of information in response to this or previous notices. Any questions regarding this notice may be directed to the Government Points of Contact: Ms. Francine M.

<p>Per AFFARS 5352.201-9101 (10 AUG 2005) the following applies:</p>
<p>(a) An ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. Further, the ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of quotes, the source selection process, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes. The ombudsman may refer the party to another official who can resolve the concern.</p>
<p>(b) Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution. Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMBC A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the Center/MAJCOM ombudsmen, Mr. Michael R. Jackson, HQ AMC/A7K, 507 Symington Drive, Scott AFB IL 62225-5022, (618) 229-0267, fax (618) 256-6668, email: Michael.jackson@scott.af.mil. Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer.</p>

<DESC>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has embarked on a series of programs aimed at revolutionizing the way defense systems and vehicles are made. Titled Adaptive Vehicle Make, the portfolio has three principal objectives: to dramatically compress development times for complex defense systems such as military air and ground vehicles, to shift the product value chain for such systems toward high-value-added design activities, and to democratize the innovation process. The Manufacturing Experimentation and Outreach (MENTOR) effort is part of the Adaptive Vehicle Make program portfolio and is aimed at engaging high school students in a series of collaborative distributed manufacturing and design experiments. The overarching objective of MENTOR is to develop and motivate a next generation cadre of system designers and manufacturing innovators, and to ensure that high school-age youths are exposed to the principles of modern prize-based design and foundry-style digital manufacturing.

The SE Core CVE Management effort focuses on delivering software and limited hardware to enable an interoperable CVE for training of the Warfighters. The ultimate objective of SE Core is to facilitate a virtual training environment supporting mission focused unit training that approximates the changing contemporary operational environment. <BR><BR>Department of Defense (DoD) Training Transformation (T2), Army Training Strategies, Army Modernization Programs, Joint/Army Training Doctrine, Joint/Army Battle Command Training Support, and Army Force Generation (ARFORGEN) require a fully integrated LVC Training Environment (TE). The SE Core program is the Armys virtual component of the LVC TE. SE Core will develop and sustain the Armys CVE which links current and future virtual simulation devices into an interoperable full spectrum training capability. The CVE will connect to gaming training enablers and the live and constructive environments for an integrated LVC TE capability. <BR><BR>As the Army transitions to a campaign-quality Army with a Joint and expeditionary mindset, our Soldiers require relevant, on demand training available anywhere, anytime, and tailored to their operational training requirements. SE Core is comprised of complementary efforts for developing the CVE that facilitates fair fight interoperability for virtual system and non-system Training Aids Devices Simulators and Simulations (TADSS). The program develops operational training terrain databases, models, and simulation architecture connectivity to meet Warfighter operational training requirements. The terrain and model development efforts provide non-proprietary, open format, and image generator independent CVE deliverables. The simulation architecture provides an integrated training network. These efforts, linking current and future virtual training devices/simulations, enables the Army to execute combined arms and joint training, as well as mission planning and rehearsals at home station and at deployed locations. <BR><BR>Since SE Cores system development and demonstration phase, requirements for training and SE Core have grown. SE Core will continue to produce terrain databases, common moving models, the virtual simulation architecture, changes to OneSAF, and common virtual components such as but not limited to After Action Review, Interoperability Gateway, Scenario Generation Tool, and C4I Adapter. New requirements include but are not limited to: CVE capability management for system and non-system TADSS, mission planning and rehearsal visualization capability, acquisition of terrain source data, development of database centers, SE Core to TADSS plug-in expansion, sound and smell representation, semi-automated forces development and integration, exercise preparation and execution capabilities and definitions for the terms interoperability and fair fight. SE Core will also facilitate integration and updates concerning OneSAF and SE Core version releases into system and non-system virtual TADSS. <BR><BR>It is anticipated that the SE Core CVE Management competition will be conducted on an unrestricted full and open competitive basis with best-value tradeoff evaluation procedures. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Class Code is 541512. The small business size standard is $25M (this is only applicable to small business Offerors who wish to participate in this full and open competition). The Government anticipates that the SE Core CVE Management solicitation will result in a five year single-award Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract. This is a Draft RFP and PEO STRI anticipates issuing the final RFP in mid-October 2010.<BR><BR>The proposal should be based on the program of record anticipated funding identified herein. <BR><BR>To assist in determination of appropriate allocation across Statements of Work, the following is provided: Top priorities are Transition Phase-In and Production related CLINS. Next priorities are Program Management and Systems Engineering CLINS. Final priorities are those CLINs related to tool and CVE Development and Maintenance (maintenance only due to current fiscal constraints). <BR><BR>Offerors are advised that, based on the priority of this program to the Army, and historical precedence, this Program of Record level of funding will likely increase with the addition of Customer Funding and adjustments to the Program of Record budget . Accordingly, Offerors should anticipate the additional funding shown below.<BR><BR>The SE Core CVE Management anticipated funding profile by fiscal year (FY) is provided below:<BR><BR>FY11  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $8M<BR>Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M, SW Development - $9M<BR>Total: $19.75M<BR><BR>FY12  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $10.8M<BR>Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M, SW Development - $4M<BR>Total: $17.55M<BR><BR>FY13  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $8.8M<BR>Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M<BR>Total: $11.55M<BR><BR>FY14  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $9.7M<BR>Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M<BR>Total: $12.45M<BR><BR>FY15  Program of Record Anticipated Funding: $19.5M<BR>Anticipated Customer Funding: Plug-ins - $2.75M<BR>Total: $22.25M<BR><BR>Questions/Comments: Any questions or comments on the draft RFP shall be submitted in writing via email to all POCs listed below no later than 3:30PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 16 July 2010. <BR><BR>Reference: The Synopsis for this SE Core action was posted to Fedbizopps on 2 July 2010.<BR><BR>The Government will not, under any circumstances, pay for Bid and Proposal (B&P) costs for Offerors who choose to prepare proposals in response to issuance of an RFP.<BR><BR>As indicated in Section L of the draft solicitation, Offerors may submit a request to obtain additional Government Technical Data in support of proposal preparation.

<DESC>This contract action was accomplished using other than competitive procedures because there is only one responsible source due to a unique capability provided, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements (FAR 6.302-1). See posted J&A for further information.<br><br>This requirement is for caretaker support services, which is to include all facilities management, operations, maintenance and repair functions required to safeguard and maintain facility services and systems the Army deems essential at Stratford Army Engine Plant (SAEP) during the Army's caretaker status phase.  This support prevents facility deterioration beyond normal wear and tear in areas with re-use potential, and to adequately support SAEP tenants by using innovative facilities management practices that reduce costs and eliminate tasks that are not cost-effective.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION


1.	Identification of (1) the agency (2) the contracting activity.

TRANSACTION #523-10-4-7821-0259.  	Boston V.A. Medical Center, Boston, MA 02130

2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.

Sole Source procurement of a Provel T6 Thermoformer (1 each)

3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value).

The Provel T6 Thermoformer is a fully automated prosthetic socket forming machine that forms sockets from performs and will be used to treat amputees and support the Polytrauma/Amputation Network site at Jamaica Plains.  The Unit includes 16, 18, and 25 cm tables and clamp rings, service manual, and a 2-year warranty.  This machine will not have access to any patient information.


4.	An identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.

FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(1), Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 


5.	A demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualification or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.

This manufacturer is the only source for this machine which uses industry standard socket performs for fast, consistent results in forming prosthetic sockets for amputee limbs.


6.	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a FedBizOps notice was or will be published as required by Subpart 5.2 and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.

	None have been made since this is the only manufacturer and seller of this machine.


7.	A determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.

The cost to the government has been determined to be reasonable and fair.


8.	A description of the market research conducted (i.e., names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.

No known market survey was conducted, since the company is the sole manufacturer for this equipment.


9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specification, engineering description, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.

I have not found this type of equipment from other sources.  This system allows full in-house production of custom prostheses to support a heavy workload in the Prosthetics unit.  Sockets formed from performs are reputed to be stronger and have less shrinkage that sockets formed from flat sheets.


10.  A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.

	No others


11.  A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.

Contracting Activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.
