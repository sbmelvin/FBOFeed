<CONTACT>Daniel App, Contract Officer, Email Daniel.App@nrc.gov - Joseph Widdup, Branch Chief, Email Joseph.Widdup@nrc.gov
<DESC>Background:
<p>The objective of this acquisition is to obtain verbatim/transcription reporting services to support the NRC in adjudicatory hearings and oral arguments, investigations, depositions and various NRC staff meetings.</p>
<p>Many NRC public meetings, hearings, and depositions are held as part of the decision-making process in licensing nuclear facilities. These activities are an extremely important and closely scrutinized part of the NRC's daily operations. The nature of the services are such that delays, errors and other forms of unsatisfactory or poor performance will jeopardize the interests of the Commission and adversely impact its regulatory review process. The NRC presides over adjudicatory hearings and oral arguments before the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) and meetings for the Advisory Committee for Reactor Safeguards (ACRS) and other Commission-level meetings. The subject matter discussed at these meetings is very complex, highly technical and may involve the handling of classified or sensitive unclassified information. At ACRS meetings, there are frequent changes of speakers and, on many occasions, more than one speaker talking at a time.</p>
<p>Some NRC meetings are less technical but equally demanding, often extremely informal, and portions may be highly sensitive or of a confidential nature. Personnel security interviews conducted by the Office of Administration's (ADM) Division of Facilities and Security and investigations by the Office of Investigations and Inspector General are sensitive and must be recorded and handled with the utmost confidentiality.</p>
<p>NRC meetings that require handling of sensitive, unclassified, or classified material are primarily held at NRC headquarters. NRC Meetings, investigations, and adjudicatory proceedings that do not require the handling of sensitive unclassified, or classified material are conducted by NRC offices and are held in various locations throughout the country. Transcripts of these meetings are produced by a contractor and are then reviewed by the NRC and published on the NRC's website for the general public to view.</p>
<p>Scope:</p>
<p>The contractor shall provide court reporting services for a variety of depositions, hearings, investigations, meetings and oral arguments throughout the United States. These locations include Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, any U.S. protectorate; the countries of Canada and Mexico; and the NRC headquarters and OI regional field offices located in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Illinois and Texas. Some of these hearings, depositions or investigations may require the handling of sensitive unclassified or classified material. It is anticipated that instances requiring the handling of sensitive unclassified or classified material, including safeguards, shall be transcribed at NRC headquarters by the contractor.</p>
<p>It will be the responsibility of the contractor to obtain all required security clearances, cleared facility, cybersecurity approvals, and the procedures for properly handling and processing of the material.</p>
<p>The contractor will be required to provide personnel with appropriate information security clearances to access any safeguards (SGI) or classified information at the NRC's offices. The contractor will also be required to obtain a facility clearance in order to process any sensitive unclassified or controlled unclassified information (CUI) at the contractor's offices. Upon obtaining a facility clearance, the contractor will be required implement a security plan and comply with the requirements established in DoD 5220.22-M "National Industrial Security Program Operation Manual (NISPOM)" at http://www.dss.mil.</p>
<p>When meetings occur at the same time across the various locations, the contractor will be required to provide support at each location simultaneously.</p>
<p>The contract will consist of a one year base period from June 11, 2018 through June 10, 2019 plus four (4) one-year options to extend the term of the contract. For proposal preparation purposes, the offeror should assume an award on or about May 15, 2018 and a postaward conference at the NRC in Rockville, Maryland within one week thereafter.</p>
<p>Solicitation Availability and Proposal Submission:</p>
<p>The NRC uses Compusearch Software Systems' secure and auditable two-way web portal, FedConnect, to communicate with offerors and contractors. FedConnect provides bi-directional communication between the offeror/contractor and the NRC throughout the preaward, award and postaward phases. Assistance with FedConnect is provided by Compusearch Software Systems, not the NRC. FedConnect contact and assistance information is provided at https://www.fedconnect.net.</p>
<p>The solicitation and any related amendments will be released only via FedConnect; therefore, potential offerors must register at https://www.fedconnect.net to access the solicitation and amendments. The solicitation is anticipated to be posted on FedConnect on or about March 8, 2018. Offerors are encouraged to check FedConnect regularly for solicitation availability and amendments to it. In addition, proposals will only be considered if they are submitted via FedConnect.</p>
<p>The solicitation will include detailed instructions for how to prepare and submit a proposal.</p>
<p>By submission of a proposal, the offeror acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee shall be registered in the System for Award Management database at www.sam.gov prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any resultant contract.</p>
<p>Evaluation Factors for Award:</p>
<p>The NRC intends to award one contract to the responsible HUBZone Small Business Offeror whose proposal is deemed to represent the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. Evaluation factors are anticipated to include technical approach, management/staffing plan, past performance information and price. Details will be included in the solicitation.</p>
<p>All responsible HUBZone small businesses may submit a proposal, which the NRC will consider.</p>
<p>Submission of Questions:</p>
<p>Email all questions to daniel.app@nrc.gov, with a copy to joseph.widdup@nrc.gov, no later than March 14, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Questions received after the deadline may not be addressed. The NRC will issue one or more amendments, as appropriate, via FedConnect to address any questions received and to make appropriate changes to the solicitation.</p>

This notice does not constitute a commitment by the United States Government to contract for any service whatsoever. All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary; the United States Government will not pay for information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in developing information provided to the United States Government.

<p><br />RCO Soto Cano is seeking the following information:</p>
<p>1. Can Industry accurately quote for all movement requirements to include customs clearance services based on what the government has provided in this RFI to include the draft performance work statement, deliverable schedule, and equipment listing?</p>
<p>2. How does industry approach delays at border crossings? Who bears the cost and risk of delays?</p>
<p>3. How does industry approach delays at pick up/drop off locations? A quoted rate for a delivery would typically include how much time? What would be considered excessive?</p>

<SOLNBR>12034318R0010
<CONTACT>Karen Ruklic, Contract Specialist, Phone 208-983-5144, Fax 208-983-4098, Email kruklic@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The Two-Mile Meadow Restoration project is being performed on the Palouse Ranger District of the Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests in collaboration with the Latah Soil and Water Conservation District (Latah SWCD). The project, in Latah County, Idaho in Sections 13 and 24 of Township 40 North, Range 01 West, is located along the East Fork Potlatch River approximately 3 miles due east of Helmer, Idaho. Two-Mile Meadow is located directly east of Forest Road 3227, off Forks Road (Forest Road 3332).<br /><br />Through Two-Mile Meadow, the East Fork Potlatch River has been diverted out of its historic channel, as a result of past logging and railroad operations and associated extirpation of beavers, negatively impacting the existing floodplain and riparian environment. The purpose of this project is to restore meadow hydrology to a state that supports healthy native meadow and riparian conditions, including restoring the stream to its historic channel and elevations. The project is designed to slow water and enhance groundwater recharge, prevent the introduction of sediment into East Fork Potlatch River from excessive streambank and bed erosion, and promote natural native vegetation and riparian and wetland areas.
<p>In general, the construction contract shall require: development of temporary access routes; removal of railroad berms; earthwork operations for construction of a channel diversion structure, ditch plugs, constructed channel segments, and fill areas; off-channel habitat and streambank treatments; sod harvest, replant, and storage; construction of habitat structures; addition of floodplain microtopography, logs, and slash; installation of fence; construction of livestock ramps; and coordination with the Forest Service Contracting Officer (Government) or their representative for dewatering and fish salvage, revegetation, and adherence to various site controls.<br /><br />Construction for this project shall occur between June 1 and October 1, 2018. The Notice to Proceed shall be issued once the government deems the meadow dry enough to mitigate resource damage but no later than July 1, 2018. Operating equipment in-stream shall occur between July 15 and September 15, 2018. Operation of equipment in the active channel is prohibited outside of this period. The contract completion deadline is October 1, 2018.<br /><br />The Government's construction estimate is between $250,000 and $500,000. A formal pre-bid meeting will be held approximately two weeks prior to the deadline for receipt of offers. Complete details will be contained in Section L of the solicitation. It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued in late March. Original bid bonds will be required. The acquisition has been set-aside for small business concerns.</p>

Acquisitions under the BOA have been and will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.

<p>This modification to JO-0002 is anticipated to procure Engineering Services including reach back, maintenance/repair, engineering/logistics analyses, reliability efforts, maintainability efforts, sparing/provisioning support, configuration management, technical support, field support and test equipment support (hardware and software), and related support for MTS in support of the Air Force. The services are for a two-one year periods.</p>
<p>Request for proposal will not be made available through <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">http://www.fbo.gov</a>. The request for proposal will be provided to Raytheon Company through electronic mail. The proposed noncompetitive contract action is anticipated to be awarded under FAR part 15, contracting by negotiations. The anticipated contract action award date is 31 AUG 2018. Responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. Companies interested in subcontracting opportunities should contact Raytheon Company, 2501 West University Drive, McKinney, TX 75071-2813 directly. <br /><br />The point of contact at NSWC Crane is Ms. Paula Herendeen, Code 0231 at telephone 812-854-5856, Fax 812-854-5066 or e-mail: <a href="mailto:paula.herendeen@navy.mil">paula.herendeen@navy.mil</a>.

Work will be performed in Ukraine.<br /><br />The purpose of the Economic Resilience Activity (ERA) is to improve the overall economic resilience of eastern Ukraine in response to Russian aggression, which has disrupted critical market linkages, catalyzed the economic decline of previously dominant industries, and caused massive population disruption. Resilience is "the ability of people, households, communities, countries, and systems to mitigate, adapt to, and recover from shocks and stresses in a manner that reduces chronic vulnerability and facilitates inclusive growth." This activity aims to improve the economic resilience of eastern Ukraine through accomplishing the following objectives:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&middot; OBJECTIVE 1: Stabilize the Economy of Eastern Ukraine</p>
<p>&middot; OBJECTIVE 2: Support the Sustainable Development of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Eastern Ukraine</p>
<p>&middot; OBJECTIVE 3: Build Confidence in the Future of the Eastern Ukrainian Economy</p>
<p>&nbsp;By accomplishing these objectives, the economy of eastern Ukraine will be more diversified, more integrated with the rest of Ukraine, less dependent on Russia, and the region's residents will be better equipped to compete for the jobs of the future, thereby improving the economic resilience of the region. The activity will work primarily in the oblasts most affected by Russia's aggression, Donetsk and Luhansk-together known as the "Donbas" region-but will also be active in the surrounding oblasts and throughout Ukraine as required to achieve the objectives.</p>
<p>The total estimated cost of the project is between $60 and 65 million and the period of performance of this contract is five (5) years from the date of award.</p>
<p>The solicitation is anticipated to be released by March 23, 2018 and will be made available electronically upon its release to www.fbo.gov</p>

<DESC>This is a Notice of Intent published in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 5.101(a)(1) requiring the dissemination of information regarding proposed contract actions. This Notice of Intent is for a proposed award of a sole source, firm-fixed price contract, as implemented by FAR 13.106-1   soliciting from a single source. It is not a request for competitive quotes.
The Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office 23 intends to award a sole source, firm-fixed price contract to Volcano Corporation for proprietary maintenance and repair support services for Volcano Core Mobile Imaging System, Volcano Core Imaging System, and Volcano Sync Vision Imaging System. VA requires the proprietary maintenance and repair services from Volcano Corporation, as implemented by FAR 13.106-1- soliciting from a single source, because the software and services are unique or proprietary to Volcano Corporation. Market research revealed that Volcano Corporation is the proprietary developer and distributor for the equipment currently being utilized by VA. Additionally, Volcano Corporation is the only manufacturer that can provide the required maintenance support for the equipment. The software system is routinely used by VA to provide medical services for veterans in the VA Healthcare System. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 811219 and the service code is J065. 
While this synopsis does not constitute a solicitation, interested vendors may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the requirement. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. The Government understands that Volcano Corporation is the only vendor that can provide the requested services. However, vendors that believe they can provide the capabilities required to fully meet the Government's requirement may submit information in writing to curt.larose@va.gov by 14 March 2018. Such documentation will be reviewed solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct the procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC><p>THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS) is in support of Market Research being conducted by the United States Air Force to identify potential manufacturing sources and to determine if this effort can be competitive or a Small Business Set-Aside. This is not a Request for Proposal (or solicitation) or an indication that a contractual commitment will exist for this requirement. The government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market research. No funds are available to fund the information solicited.</p>
<p>The 421St Supply Chain Management Squadron located at Tinker Air Force Base is requesting information, pursuant to FAR PART 10, in support of Market Research to identify potential sources for the manufacture of the NSN(s) listed below. The government does not have the associated technical data to provide to potential sources. No Qualification requirements exist and No Source Approval Request (SAR) package can be submitted.

Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years.

THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT ON THE BASIS OF THIS RFI OR REIMBURSE ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS RFI.<br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a Solicitation, an Invitation for Bids, a Request for Proposal, a Request for Quotation, or an indication the Government will contract for the items contained in this announcement. This RFI is a request for interested parties to describe their product, technical capabilities, delivery as well as demonstrated tools and processes. All information received in response to this RFI marked Proprietary will be handled accordingly. Responses to the RFI will not be returned and Respondents will not be notified of the result of the review. Whatever information is provided in response to this RFI will be used to assess tradeoffs and alternatives available for determining how to proceed in the acquisition process for NMCSD. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this RFI are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. <br />All information received in response to this RFI marked proprietary will be handled accordingly.<br />Purpose: <br />The Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) issues this Request for Information (RFI) to conduct market research for information and planning purposes to determine the existing market capability of businesses that are able to provide the requested equipment, INTEGRATED COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (ICS) TECHNOLOGY, as specified below, at Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD), to include product demonstration at NMCSD - dates to be determined - to have Government employees inspect, request additional information and sample equipment. The Government intends to review all proposed suggestions. All interested, capable, and responsible businesses are encouraged to submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><br />INTRODUCTION<br />The NMCSD Innovations Committee and Informatics Departments are tasked with conducting market research for Integrated Communication Systems to be used by Hospital Staff throughout the many departments within the hospital. Using Government provided space, a select number of potential vendors will be invited to provide product demonstrations including question and answer sessions with hospital staff members. <br />Respondents should identify their product capabilities that would help fulfill the currently specified requirements. The information gathered, if deemed successful, will be used to formulate final requirements, which may subsequently be posted in a solicitation for competitive bids. The description below outlines preliminary requirements for Integrated Communication Systems at NMCSD.<br />BACKGROUND<br />Effective Internal Communication Tools are essential to optimize efficiency, patient safety, and the delivery of quality medical care, as well as facilitate the ability to transfer protected patient information between providers and potentially patients. Per the Joint Commission website, "effective communication is critical to the successfully delivery of health care services." The Joint Commission has identified communication as one of the top three root causes of sentinel events. Some inherent barriers to communication a from staff to staff and patient to staff are effected by distance, location and physical layout of each department across the organization. Smartphone communication is the method of choice among providers, with text messaging being utilized as the primary form of communication for 58% of residents. In order to prevent violations of patient privacy through unsecured devices, we are interested in being able to provide providers and medical staff with a means to communicate patient information in a secure manner. <br />REQUIREMENTS<br />The Government requests that the contractor or contractors provide ICS with the following minimum characteristics:<br />1. Provide efficient and timely communication; <br />2. Provide real time, collaborative communication;<br />3. Ability to transmit text, voice messages, photos, and video;<br />4. Application available for use on all mobile devices;<br />5. Ability to securely transfer private patient information between medical professionals (Doctors, nurses, physician assistants, etc.);<br />6. Ability for patients to communicate with their provider;<br />7. Ability to interface with MHS Genesis; <br />8. HIPAA compliant;<br />9. DOD compliant.</p>
<p>NOTE: This RFI is only soliciting information on Communication Tools that are able to meet the above requirements. <br />All questions regarding this RFI shall be submitted by email only to the Contract Specialist at robert.m.salomon2.civ@mail.mil <br />HOW TO RESPOND: Firms that wish to respond to this RFI shall provide the following information: <br />1) A brief summary of the responder's product and its characteristics in relation to the above-indicated requirements and additional preference characteristics; <br />2) A statement indicating an interest and the capability to provide the requested equipment in response to this RFI including acceptance of trade-in equipment; <br />3) Brochures, technical layout and specifications, user guides, product compatibility, test results, agency approvals and certifications as it relates to the equipment requested in this RFI;<br />4) Company representative availability for product demonstration and question and answer session in relation to this RFI; and <br />5) Respondents must indicate whether their responses contain proprietary information if the respondents wish for the responses to be handled as such. The government shall not be held liable for any damages incurred if proprietary information is not properly identified.<br />DESCRIPTION OF INFORMATION REQUESTED<br />All vendors with qualifying products are invited to submit a Capability Statement and contact information. The Capability Statement should discuss the product's capabilities as they related to the potential requirements. Vendors with a GSA schedule should provide the contract number of that schedule and the expiration date as well as product NAICS codes. All items should be clearly identified if they are scheduled items or open market items. <br />All Questions must be submitted via email only prior to close of business March 1, 2018. Answers will be posted with this notice on March 5, 2018. <br />Responses shall be limited to no more than 10 pages with 12 point font, not including cover letter, cover page, and table of contents.

<CONTACT>Burns, Brent M.
<DESC>In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, the Department of Energy (DOE), National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) intends to award a purchase order, on a sole source basis, to Pennsylvania State University (PSU) to purchase a microwave single mode system because NETL requires an engineered cavity with a controlled distribution of electromagnetic fields to allow for the unique processing of materials in oscillating electric or magnetic fields.  This microwave annealing system will be used to control the detailed thermal profile for an in-line manufacturable process of amorphous and nanocrystalline magnetic core materials.  This is considered a sole source to PSU because, to the best of the NETLs knowledge and based on market research conducted, PSU has designed and assembled a unique system capable for an in-line annealing process of amorphous and nanocrystalline alloy ribbons.  No known potential alternate sources exist which could satisfy NETL's requirement.  
 
This notice of intent is not a request for quote/proposal.  Any interested party that believes it is capable of meeting the NETL requirement described herein may identify themselves and must provide evidence of their capability to fulfill the requirement being requested by 9 AM local time (LT) on March 15, 2018.  Responses must be submitted in writing to Brent M. Burns, via email at Brent.Burns@netl.doe.gov no later than the time and date noted above. Telephone responses and requests will not be received. 
 
A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is not a solicitation announcement. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this synopsis is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and their size classification (Hubzone, 8(a), small, small disadvantage, service disabled veteran owned small business, etc.) relative to NAICS 541519, Other Computer Related Services (size standard of $27.5 Million). Responses to this synopsis will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. After review of the responses to this sources sought synopsis, a solicitation announcement may be published on the FedBizOpps website. Responses to this sources sought synopsis are not considered adequate responses to the solicitation announcement. All interested offerors will have to respond to the solicitation announcement in addition to responding to this sources sought. No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow up information requests.
<p>The Florida Army National Guard (FLARNG) is seeking potential sources and feedback capable of performing all functions associated with the migration from a current Access Control System (ACS) environment over to CISCO Identity Services Engine (ISE). The FLARNG has acquired the CISCO ISE equipment and software for use on the FLARNG military network. The FLARNG wishes to migrate their current ACS environment over to Cisco ISE as well as integrate dynamic authentication and authorization capabilities into their existing infrastructure, leveraging Cisco ISE. This project will migrate the current ACS environment, initially install ISE into the environment for 802.1x in a proof of concept capacity, test and document the use cases developed with the FLARNG, and perform informal training on the as-&not;built system for preparation of the FLARNG to install into the production network. The vendor will also assist the FLARNG with a limited scope test rollout moving into production. For the wired network, up to 96 ports on up to 2 switches will be configured for authentication, authorization, and profiling.</p>
<p>Period of Performance is thirty (30) days after date of order.</p>
<p>Contractors with the expertise to successfully perform the requirements outlined in this notice are encouraged to submit a capability statement.</p>
<p>The Government reserves the right to consider a small business set-aside based upon responses hereto for any subsequent action. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DOD contract and with their local SBA office. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that small business prime contractors must perform at least 50% of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS:</p>
<p>1. The information below provides a "Contractor Capability Survey" to allow you to document your company's capabilities in meeting these requirements.</p>
<p>2. If, after reviewing these documents, you desire to participate in the market research, please complete and return the Contractor Capability Survey below. Response format and due date information is specified at the bottom portion of this notice. Failure to provide a complete response may result in the government being unable to adequately assess your capabilities. If you lack sufficient experience in a particular area, please provide details explaining how you would overcome the lack of experience/capabilities in order to perform that portion of the requirement (i.e., teaming, subcontracting, etc.)</p>
<p>3. This sources sought inquiry is for all potential vendors.</p>
<p>Questions relative to this market survey should be addressed via email to Jeff Moore, at Jeffrey.d.moore14.mil@mail.mil</p>
<p>Part I. Sources Sought:<br />Please provide the following business information for your firm in the following format:</p>
<p>Vendor Name/ Cage Code/ Point of Contact: Socio-Economic Status/ GSA Contract # Capability <br />[ABC, Inc]<br />Cage:[1FAK4]<br />Name:[John Smith]<br />Phone: [(555)123-4567]<br />Email: [john.smith@abcinc.com]<br />URL: www.abcinc.com<br />1.

[GSA Contract # GS-XX-XXXXX] [Provides all required services with consistent superior past performance ratings.]</p>
<p>Please also indicate:</p>
<p>If your company has experience providing the services anticipated in the migration from an SCS to CISCO ISE environment.</p>
<p>Whether your company has recent sales history to commercial companies.</p>
<p>Attention: Small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort. The acquisition strategy for this requirement has not been decided; however, the Florida Army National Guard is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for small businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of providing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>Part II. Request for Information: If possible, please provide answers to the following questions.</p>
<p>1. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that has the effect of limiting competition among potential vendors?</p>
<p>2. Is there an alternate NAICS that you believe is more appropriate for this requirement? If so, what is the NAICS and why?</p>
<p>3. Is there anything in the PWS that has the effect of creating duplicative of unnecessary costs to the Government? Do you have any additional comments on the PWS?</p>
<p>4. Based on your experience, are the requested services commercial in nature as defined by FAR 2.101? If so, why, and are there established catalog or market prices for these services?</p>
<p>CAPABILITIES PACKAGE:</p>

The Government will not reimburse any costs incurred or associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion.</p>

Occupants of school transportation vehicles accounted for 9 percent of the fatalities, and nonoccupants (pedestrians, bicyclists, etc.) accounted for 20 percent of the fatalities. A school-transportation-related crash is a crash that involves, either directly or indirectly, a school bus body vehicle, or a non-school bus functioning as a school bus, transporting children to or from school or school-related activities. From 2006 to 2015 almost two-thirds (64%) of the school-age pedestrians fatally injured in crashes were struck by school buses or vehicles functioning as school buses, while 36 percent were struck by vehicles of other body types.</span></p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: center;">Federal Business Opportunities (FBO)<br />SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE</p>
<p>1. Solicitation Number: HHSN-NIH-NIDA-SS-18-097</p>
<p>2. Title: Transcriptome Analysis of Pluripotent Stem Cell Differentiation Process at the Single-Cell Level</p>
<p>3. Classification Code: 66 - Instruments and Laboratory Equipment</p>
<p>4. NAICS Code: 334516 - Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing</p>
<p>Description: This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The Stem Cell Translation Laboratory (SCTL) is a state-of-the-art research facility within NCATS' Division of Pre-Clinical Innovation dedicated to addressing the scientific and technological challenges in the iPSC field. SCTL aims to bring iPSC technology closer to clinical application, drug discovery and regenerative medicine. Ongoing research projects in SCTL focus on understanding molecular mechanisms regulating stem cell pluripotency and their multi-lineage differentiation capabilities with a focus on defining optimum culture conditions for maintaining pluripotent stem cells and their conversion to homogeneous and mature population of differentiated cells. To achieve these aims, high throughput screening is employed to identify mechanisms/small molecules that aid in single cell cloning of stem cells. In addition, detailed high-resolution analysis of intermediate cell types during conversion of stem cells to differentiated cell types is being carried out to better understand regulators of directed differentiation. These projects will facilitate stem cell based drug discovery and disease modeling in addition to meeting project milestones.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: The SCTL requires the acquisition of the "Chromium<sup>TM</sup> Single Cell 3' Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v2, 16 rxns" and "Chromium<sup>TM</sup> Single Cell A Chip Kit, 48 rxns" for the consistency and continuity of ongoing stem cell research protocols and projects. The reagent kits (Chromium<sup>TM</sup> Single Cell 3' Library &amp; Gel Bead Kit v2, 16 rxns) provide high throughput reagent delivery using the chip kits (Chromium<sup>TM</sup> Single Cell A Chip Kit, 48 rxns), which are microfluidic chips. The 8-sample cartridge is loaded with the gel beads, a 3' counting reagent, a cell suspension, and an oil-surfactant solution. Reagents and cells are combined at a microfluidic junction where gel bead-containing emulsions (GEMs) are generated. GEMs are created in such a way that single cells are partitioned and &gt;90% of reactions contain a unique cell-linked molecular barcode. The simple workflow creates up to 100,000 GEMs per channel in a 7-minute instrument run time. The Chromium multiplex kit reagents are added in the amplification step of library construction for the product generated by the 10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Controller and Chromium reagent kits. Ongoing projects on defining stem cell differentiation process in heterogeneous population require the examination of transcriptional profiling at single cell level. The Chromium reagent kits, chip kits, and multiplex kits are designed specifically for use with a current equipment "10X Genomics Chromium Single Cell Controller" based on the droplet-based reagent delivery method that uses a microfluidic chip to provide high-throughput single cell preparation and 65% cell capture efficiency. In addition, the sequencing libraries constructed from these kits are compatible with the Illumina NextSeq500 Sequencer, another instrument that is owned by SCTL.</p>

<DESC><strong>Next Generation First Responder Integration Handbook Request for Information (RFI)<br /></strong>The DHS Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) First Responders Group (FRG) is issuing an RFI for public feedback and comments on the technical specification known as the Next Generation First Responder (NGFR) Integration Handbook. The goal of the NGFR Integration Handbook is to help technology developers design, test and integrate technologies into an interoperable first responder system. DHS requests industry partners, subject matter experts, and the public provide feedback to help evolve and develop the detail needed in this technical specification.<br /><br /><strong>About the NGFR Integration Handbook</strong><br />To guide industry in development, design, test and integration of responder technologies, DHS S&amp;T has created the NGFR Integration Handbook, which outlines a "plug-and-play," standards-based environment that enables commercially-developed technologies to integrate with existing first responder infrastructure. DHS S&amp;T is not drafting new standards; rather DHS S&amp;T is identifying and recommending existing standards that developers may implement. This handbook will guide industry system developers and vendors on interoperability requirements that may facilitate integration.<br /><br />The NGFR Apex program aims to encourage innovators to develop interoperable technologies that address first responder needs. Through this guidance, the NGFR Integration Handbook will reduce barriers to entry into the first responder marketplace and open doors to entrepreneurs, while lowering costs and increasing choices for public safety organizations. Version 2.0 of the NGFR Integration Handbook is the first public iteration of the document, released to incorporate industry and general public feedback and to improve the framework for first responder integration. This handbook and its recommendations will evolve over time to encompass the best practices for first responder voice, video and data interoperability and integration.<br /><br />The NGFR Integration Handbook is organized in three parts, with each part increasing in level of technical detail. <br />&bull; Part 1: Introduction reviews the NGFR Apex program and the basic components that make up the Responder SmartHub - the on-body sensor and communications networks that make integration possible. This section is intended for executive audiences who do not necessarily have technical knowledge. <br />&bull; Part 2: Engineering Design, the handbook presents a more detailed technical review of the components and the interoperability standards applied to facilitate integration. <br />&bull; Part 3: Technical Supplement, the handbook dives deeper into the programming required to enable data and software integration, and also includes a full list of NGFR Apex program requirements - all defined in partnership with first responders - to help industry develop technologies more closely aligned to user needs. <br /><strong><br />Instructions</strong><br />&bull; Visit <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/ngfr/handbook">https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/ngfr/handbook</a> to review the NGFR Integration handbook<br />&bull; Fill out the comment matrix available at the same webpage and email to <a href="mailto:NGFR@hq.dhs.gov">NGFR@hq.dhs.gov</a>. Any comments submitted outside of the comment matrix will not be considered.<br />&bull; Please note any comment matrices must be submitted by April 30, 2018 to be considered. <br /><strong><br />Additional Information</strong><br />Those who submit comments are encouraged, but not required, to include basic information about their organization on the comment matrix. All organizations who submitted comments will be acknowledged in the acknowledgements section of Part 1: Introduction of the handbook. In addition, to demonstrate transparency about the evolution of the NGFR Integration Handbook, all comments matrices and their adjudication will be posted on the DHS S&amp;T webpage upon the publication of version 3.0 in August 2018.<br /><br />DHS S&amp;T welcomes ongoing feedback from industry and the general public. Comments submitted after April 30, 2018, will be accepted by DHS S&amp;T but held until the review period for version 3.0 is concluded in October 2018. These comments will then be incorporated into version 4.0, and acknowledgements for contributing organizations will be listed in that version. The NGFR Integration Handbook will evolve iteratively through the input DHS S&amp;T receives and based on lessons-learned from practical application of the guidance. It is living document that DHS S&amp;T hopes to co-create with industry.<br /><br />Responses should be sent via email to <a href="mailto:NGFR@hq.dhs.gov">NGFR@hq.dhs.gov</a>. Any technical questions should be directed to <a href="mailto:NGFR@hq.dhs.gov">NGFR@hq.dhs.gov</a>. Please do not send any technical questions or responses to the RFI to the&nbsp;Contract Specialist.&nbsp;

<DESC><strong>Emerging Technology Solutions to Enhance First Responder Safety and Effectiveness<br /><br />A. INTRODUCTION:<br /><br /></strong>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate's (S&amp;T) Next Generation First Responder (NGFR) Apex program is hosting the 2018 NGFR - Harris County Operational Experimentation (OpEx). The NGFR - Harris County OpEx will take place over three days during the week of December 3, 2018, at Port of Houston in Houston, Texas, and will integrate first responder technologies to enhance the mission-response capabilities of Houston-area responders and the U.S. Coast Guard. The NGFR - Harris County OpEx builds directly upon the success of the 2017 Grant County - DHS S&amp;T NGFR Technology Experiment, which tested the integration of physiological and location sensors, situational awareness systems, drones, datacasting and deployable communications into a cohesive public safety solution. During the 2018 OpEx, DHS S&amp;T will evaluate how DHS-developed technologies, commercial technologies, and legacy public safety systems integrate using open standards, and how those integrated capabilities increase responder safety and efficiency. DHS S&amp;T will work with FirstNet to assess user experience of priority and preemption capabilities of participating partners.<br /><br />For the NGFR - Harris County OpEx, the NGFR Apex program will provide participating responders with solutions that use guidelines found in the NGFR Integration Handbook1 to integrate into existing Harris County and City of Houston applications, processes and procedures, without adding to first responders' workloads. Responders from the City of Houston, Harris County, Port of Houston and the U.S. Coast Guard will participate in a functional exercise with a HazMat scenario at the port, and will be equipped with integrated systems of DHS-developed and commercial technologies the enhance or provide new capabilities.<br /><br />DHS S&amp;T is seeking to evaluate technology solutions that provide on-body, incident area, agency-wide, or cross-jurisdictional capabilities that make responders better protected, connected and fully aware, and is focusing on these capability gaps:<br />1. On-body or handheld sensors (e.g., physiological monitoring, environmental threat detection, indoor location tracking),<br />2. On-body or handheld situational awareness displays or devices (e.g., mapping application that can show responder location and sensor data alerts, heads-up displays) for first responders and/or incident commanders,<br />3. On-body devices that manage or intelligently route multiple communications pathways (e.g., Land Mobile Radio, LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Satellite, FirstNet) for first responders,<br />4. Data analytics services that synthesize data, analyze and present actionable information to first responders and/or incident commanders,<br />5. Body-worn power distribution and data connectivity systems,<br />6. Indoor mesh networks for Land Mobile Radio, Wi-Fi and LTE devices,<br />7.

Interfaces between CAD systems and collaboration applications.<br />10. Indoor responder location system<br /><br />Details of these technology solution descriptions and criteria are provided in Appendix C.<br /><br />DHS S&amp;T invites industry, academia, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers and other Government organizations to submit applications addressing innovative technology solutions for integration, testing and evaluation during the NGFR - Harris County OpEx.<br /><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) for participation only and the Government will not award a contract on the basis of this RFI. Respondents who are selected will be asked to enter into a Limited Purpose Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (LP-CRADA) with DHS S&amp;T in order to participate in the Harris County OpEx. Responses should be focused on offeror's capability to provide and integrate the requested solutions. Solutions must be Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or above.<br /><br />Organizations that respond will not be paid for the information submitted and the Government will not pay for any submission preparation or related costs. Documents submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government invitation to participate in the NGFR - Harris County OpEx. The Government may or may not use any responses to this RFI as a basis for a subsequent project.<br /><br /><strong>B. OBJECTIVE:</strong><br /><br />During the NGFR - Harris County OpEx, DHS S&amp;T will test and evaluate the selected technology solutions (equipment includes software/hardware/firmware) and how well they integrate with other commercial technologies, DHS-developed technologies and legacy public safety systems in compliance with the NGFR Integration Handbook guidance. The test and evaluation will take place during a scenario-based operational experiment involving local public safety, U.S. Coast Guard and Port of Houston entities. DHS S&amp;T is looking to assess a wide variety capabilities including but not limited to the integration of sensors, communication systems, location services, collaboration apps and situational awareness platforms to support first responder operations. Selected participants will receive copies of the NGFR Integration Handbook and will participate in guided integration discussions prior to the event to ensure successful operation and integration during the OpEx.<br /><br />DHS S&amp;T is looking for selected organizations to be able to participate in ongoing collaboration (as outlined in the LP-CRADA) and three specific events:<br />* Integration Conference Calls, May-December (bi-weekly or as appropriate)<br />* Integration Testing in August (3 days)<br />* OpEx Dry Run in October (3 days)<br />* Final OpEx event in December (3 days)<br /><br />Through these events and ongoing collaboration (as outlined in the LP-CRADA), DHS S&amp;T seeks to increase the probability that all components can be integrated using open-source standards as found in the NGFR Integration Handbook, and that participating first responders have time to practice using the technologies before the operational scenarios during the OpEx. Beyond the successful event, DHS S&amp;T would like to demonstrate a technical and operational proof of concept for first responder technology integration, and participating organizations will be asked to provide feedback on the NGFR Integration Handbook to collaboratively improve the integration approach.<br /><br />In return for their participation, participating organizations will have exposure to Harris County (the third most populous county in the U.S.) and City of Houston (the fourth most populous city in the U.S.) public safety leadership and responders, the U.S. Coast Guard and other technology development organizations. The ongoing collaborations will help build relationships between partners that may prove advantageous. In addition, all participating organizations will receive a copy of their DHS S&amp;T evaluation and will be recognized as a participant in DHS S&amp;T media releases and after action knowledge products, as well as in later versions of the NGFR Integration Handbook.<br /><br />As an outcome of this OpEx, DHS S&amp;T will provide the after action report to federal, state and local law enforcement and public safety organizations for them to use as guidance in acquiring and fielding similar interfaces and solutions.<br /><br />After review of the technology solution applications, the Government may invite candidates to participate in NGFR - Harris County OpEx where the integration of these technologies will be evaluated during operational scenarios. In addition to participating in the main event in December 2018, selected participants will be asked to participate in integration planning calls, the integration testing in August, and an OpEx dry run in October. As stated above, participating organizations will be required to enter into an LP-CRADA that defines the conditions of participation, including intellectual property rights and security parameters for sharing information. A draft LP-CRADA template is provided in Appendix D. DHS S&amp;T will provide the test environment and plan and each selected participant will use them and share data in return. Industry participation in the NGFR - Harris County OpEx does not suggest or imply that the Government will endorse, procure, or purchase equipment.<br /><br />NOTE: This is an integration event. <strong>All organizations that apply must understand that their technologies will be integrated into a larger system of first responder technology, and will share data between devices owned and operated by other companies and/or first responder organizations. </strong>Hardware and/or software integration is required, and participating organizations will assist with that integration. Do not submit an application if you are unwilling to integrate your solution with other technologies. See Section F for more information on Intellectual Property rights during the NGFR - Harris County OpEx.<br /><br /><strong>C.

<DESC>U.S. GOVERNMENT is seeking competitive lease proposals for new and/or continuing leasing opportunities through the Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP). <br /> <br /> <br />HOW TO OFFER: The Government will use its Automated Advanced Acquisition Program (AAAP), located at https://aaap.gsa.gov. The AAAP will enable interested parties to offer space for lease to the Federal Government for future projects.  The offer submission process is entirely web-based and allows registered participants to submit and update offers based on a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP) within a specified time frame referred to as the &lsquo;Open Period'.  Interested parties must go to the AAAP website, select the "Register to Offer Space" link and follow the instructions to register.  Instructional guides and video tutorials are offered on the AAAP homepage and in the "HELP" tab on the AAAP website. Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during the &lsquo;Open Period'.<br /><br /> <br />Offerors interested in submitting an offer are encouraged to do so during the Open Period. Draft offers can not be submitted during the Closed Period (typically the 8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.<br /><br />
<p>The Open Period for MARCH* is MARCH 1, 2018 to MARCH 7, 2018, ending at 11:59 p.m. EST.  The AAAP will be used to award leases of no less than 500 ANSI/BOMA Office Area (ABOA) square feet (SF) to satisfy new requirements and/or compete existing leases for potential replacement.  The Government reserves the right to award more than the 500 ABOA SF minimum mentioned herein, to make multiple awards, and/or combine multiple space requirements.  Building/ space specifications and offer terms and conditions are contained in the RLP and related documents posted on the website (https://aaap.gsa.gov).  Specific requirements will be identified after the close of the Open Period.

THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE ONLY.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR QUOTE; THE VA IS NOT SEEKING PRICING OR OFFERS.

The Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 20, in support of Portland VA Medical Center, Portland, Oregon is currently requesting information to determine the existence of viable commercial sources capable of providing Radioactive Waste Disposal Services.

The intended contract period of performance is for: 20 March 2018   19 May 2018

Description of Services: The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, materials, tools, packaging, equipment, analysis, travel, transportation, documentation, waste treatments, disposal and support services required to dispose of radioactive waste for the Portland Veteran Affairs Medical Center.

The Contractor shall possess a license to package, receive, document, transport, and deliver research radioactive waste in accordance to State of Washington, State of Oregon, city, county, Department of Transportation, and US Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations.

The VAMC in Portland conducts some medical research and routine diagnostic lab applications using isotopes. Uranium is used to create a stain that is used in histology. These stains are typically less than 5% Uranium Acetate or Uranium Nitrate in water and sometimes the solution also contains methanol or ethanol. Lead citrate is also sometimes a component of this stain.  Tritium and Carbon-14 are also used in research but in small (microcurie) amounts.  ESI was called on site to organize waste containers and develop waste disposal information.  The Government did some pH testing, examined container labels, and conversed with VA staff in deciding how to consolidate and sample the waste materials. The Government ended up with 5 samples with the following descriptions.

VA-1 is believed to be Uranium acetate solution used in staining. ESI composited everything with a pH above 2. The uranium (U-Nat) specific activity in the sample is on the order of 50 picocuries per gram based on testing in ESI s Liquid Scintillation Counter.

<CONTACT>Johnny Montano, Contract Specialist, Phone 505-846-4579, Email johnny.montano@us.af.mil
<DESC><strong>Notice Type</strong>: Pre-Solicitation Notice, Surety, Survivability and Strategic Systems Assessment Support
<p><strong>NAICS Code</strong>: 541330 Engineering Services<br /><strong>Product/Service Code (PSC)</strong>: R425- Engineering and Technical Services</p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>:</p>
<p>It is the intent of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center (AFNWC) at Kirtland AFB to issue a sole source contract to the Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Valencia Solutions, LLC, 805 Morningside Dr NE, Albuquerque, NM 87110, Cage code: 7EFX8 under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(5) as implemented by FAR 6.302-5(b)(7).</p>
<p>The scope of this acquisition includes support to the AFNWC in the following areas: contract program management, project-specific management, policy and guidance analysis, and recommendations in regards to strategic system capability assessments based on an established, demonstrated base of experience, electromagnetic pulse, and nuclear surety and certification as well as vulnerability analyses and assessments. (See attached Performance Work Statement). <br /><br />The contractor must have knowledge of and experience with the nuclear enterprise and must have executed Strategic System Capability Assessments (SSCA), Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) evaluations, and nuclear surety and certification analyses efforts, which contribute to major ACAT programs. Also, the contractor must have a full understanding and experience executing both the DoD's 5000 series and DOE's Phase 6.X acquisitions. Specifically, the contractor must have knowledge and experience in the integration of the DOE-owned systems with the DoD platform. Additionally, the contractor must have expertise in Vulnerability Modes and Effects Analyses (VMEA) of air-delivered nuclear weapon system life-cycle logistics, operations, and system analysis as well as Intercontinental Ballistic Missile and Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications lifecycle assessments. Specific expertise is related to weapon system logistics states such as transportation, storage, maintenance, and generation. Finally, specific expertise with DOE/DoD nuclear weapon systems command and control interface/designs. Overall, this acquisition requires expertise in the nuclear enterprise. <br /><br />The contractor must possess a Top Secret (TS) level facility clearance. All contractor employees must possess and maintain a TS security clearance. <br /><br />Market Research indicates that award to a new contractor would result in significant duplication of costs due to investments needed to gain a fundamental knowledge and understanding of the information/data already generated, required level of Subject Matter Expertise that can be dedicated to these efforts, and the learning curve to gain the capabilities to develop and execute the very unique and specific classified requirements in generating, validating, and testing VMEA and SSCA efforts. Based on this reasoning, there is only one WOSB contractor who is capable of performing the aforementioned follow-on DOE services without added investment and ramp-up time and costs, with the appropriate key personnel for the effort.<br /><br /><strong>Restrictions</strong>: AFNWC is authorized to exclude all foreign participation at the prime contractor level for subject procurement. Foreign participation is prohibited at the prime contractor level. U.S. based offerors must disclose any proposed use of foreign nationals (FNs), their country(ies) of origin, the type of visa or work permit possessed, and the PWS tasks intended for accomplishment by the FN(s). Offerors are advised FNs proposed to perform may be restricted under U.S. Export Control Laws due to the nature of the technical data.</p>
<p><strong>RESTRICTION ON PERFORMANCE BY FOREIGN CITIZENS</strong> (i.e., those holding non-U.S. Passports): This topic is "Export-controlled". The information and materials provided pursuant to or resulting from this topic are restricted under the ITAR, 22 C.F.R. Parts 120 - 130 or the EAR, 15 C.F.R. Parts 710 - 774. Foreign Citizens may perform work under an unclassified award resulting from this topic only if they are designated as a U.S. Person, as defined by 22 CFR &sect; 120.15, or if bidder is able to obtain an export license through the Department of State or Department of Commerce. Foreign Citizens designated as U.S. Persons are not permitted to perform work under a classified award. Foreign citizens will at no time be allowed to work on Air Force installations.<br /><br />This notice is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, nor will the Government reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Any information submitted by respondents is strictly voluntary. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are NOT considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The decision to solicit for a contract shall be solely within the Government's discretion. Respondents will not be notified individually of the results of any Government assessments. The Government may use the information obtained from responses to this notice in determining its acquisition approach, but the issuance of this notice does not restrict the Government's acquisition approach. The U.S. Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any input as a result of this notice.<br /><br /><strong>Contracting office address</strong>:<br />1551 Wyoming Blvd SE <br />Kirtland AFB, NM 87117<br />United States</p>

<DESC><br />The Corps of Engineers Galveston District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of a Project Labor Agreement (PLA) for the following large scale (exceeding $25 million) construction/dredging project: Corpus Christi Ship Channel, Texas, Channel Improvement Project, Entrance Channel Extension in Nueces and San Patricio Counties, Texas, Dredging.
<p>Project Description: The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Galveston District plans to solicit offers for the Corpus Christi Ship Channel, Texas, Channel Improvement Project, Entrance Channel Extension in Nueces and San Patricio Counties, Texas, Dredging. Type of Dredge: Deep Draft Pipeline and/or Hopper. The work consists of Schedule No. 1 - The Corpus Christi Ship Channel, Texas Channel Improvement Project Entrance Channel Extension is contract that combines maintenance and new work dredging starting at station 70+00, just bay side of the Port Aransas Ferry Landing to -330+00, some 7.6 miles into the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>The contract involves the complete clean out (maintenance material) of the existing channel (47/49 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW)) template and the deepening (new work) of the new channel (54/56 feet MLLW) template. The volume of maintenance material is estimated to be approximately 844,042 CYs. All maintenance material from the existing project template will be dredged and discharged into Ocean Dredged Material Disposal Site ODMDS Placement Area 1. The construction of the new channel (authorized depth and advanced maintenance) is estimated to generate approx. 4,458,250 CYs, with allowable over depth estimated at approx. 986,647 CYs of new material. Approximately 2.6 million CYs of new work material will be placed into ODMDS Navy Homeport and the estimated 2.8 million CYs will be placed in Beneficial Use Site MN. NOTE: Performance period restrictions apply for the use of Hopper Dredges for dredging of new work material (does not apply to maintenance material) from November 15th to April 15th due to (National Marine Fisheries Service's Biological Opinion on the Corpus Christi Ship Channel Improvement Project). All Dredges utilized, Pipeline, Hopper, or mechanical proposed for use to beyond the COLREGS Demarcation Lines must follow all applicable Laws and Regulations including but not limited to 33 CFR 81.18.</p>
<p>Range of Magnitude: Between $25,000,000 and $50,000,000.</p>
<p>Period of Performance: Approximately 365 calendar days after Notice to Proceed. Notice to Proceed is anticipated to occur in July 2018.</p>
<p>Some of the factors that may be considered regarding their use are:<br />a. The involvement of multiple contractors and/or subcontractors working in the same channel.<br />b. The complexity of the project.<br />c. The ability of the contractor to pump material six and a half miles from dredging cut to placement area.<br />d. The ability to coordinate with U.S. Coast Guard Vessel Traffic Service, Pilots, and shipping industry.<br />e. Shortage of skilled labor in the region.<br />f. The use of PLA's on other comparable projects.<br />g. The promotion of the Governments long term programs interests such as training of skilled workforce for future projects.<br />h. The possibility of labor disputes that threaten timely completion.<br />i. Additional costs from use of PLAs may be cost prohibitive.</p>
<p>PLA Definition:</p>
<p>A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f).</p>
<p>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:<br />Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction/dredging projects.<br />An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction/dredging on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will<br />Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and<br />Be consistent with law.<br />Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement.<br />In consideration of the above factors, and any others which may be deemed appropriate, the construction/dredging community is invited to comment on the use of PLAs. Of particular interest to the Government are responses to the following questions:</p>
<p>a. Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar contracts within the above referenced location? What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Galveston District contract? What type of project should or should not be considered for PLA?</p>
<p>b. Is the use of PLAs effective in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement? What is the estimated relative cost impact, or any other economies or efficiencies derived by the Federal Government, if using PLAs? Will a PLA impact the cost of submitting an offer?</p>
<p><br />c. Is the use of PLAs effective in producing labor-management stability? Have labor disputes or other labor issues contributed to project delays in the local area?</p>
<p>d. Is the use of PLAs conducive to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other relevant matters? Are there instances where these standards have not been met on Federal contracts in the local area? Were PLAs used for those specific contracts?</p>
<p>e. Projects will require multiple construction/dredging contractors and/or subcontractors employing workers in multiple marine crafts or trades. Do you foresee any work on projects that may result in both the prime contractor and at least one subcontractor, or two or more subcontractors, employing the same trade?</p>
<p>f. Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction/dredging labor? Information may reference current apprenticeship statistics and workforce age demographics.</p>
<p>g. Completion of anticipated projects will require an extensive performance periods. Will a PLA impact the completion time? What is the anticipated volatility in the labor market for the marine trades required for the execution of the project? Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule?</p>
<p>h. Where have PLAs been used on comparable projects undertaken by Federal, State, municipal, or private entities in the geographic area of this project?</p>
<p>i. Will the use of PLAs impact the ability of potential Offerors and subcontractors to<br />meet small-business utilization goals?</p>
<p>Please provide your responses to these questions and any comments via e-mail to Lucille R. Smith, Contract Specialist at lucille.r.smith@usace.army.mil no later than 4:00 PM (CST) on 13 March 2018.</p>
<p>This is NOT a Request for Proposal and does not constitute any commitment by the Government. Responses to this labor market survey will be used by the Government to make appropriate acquisition decisions. All interested sources must respond to future solicitation announcements separately from responses to this survey.</p>

STATEMENT OF WORK
NEPEC DATA ENTRY CONTRACT

Scope:
The Contractor shall provide data entry services for VA Connecticut Healthcare System, Northeast Program Evaluation Center (NEPEC), Yale University West Campus, 100 West Campus Drive, Orange, CT 06477.  The data entry services shall be done at the contractor s facility.  The data entry services are for NEPEC s data processing project (DPP).  The DPP is a generalized data entry project in which data is transferred from paper survey forms to a computer, and a computer-readable representation of the data contained on the forms is produced.
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF CONTRACTOR:
1.   Data Entry Program Product Development: The Contractor shall provide the development and maintenance of computerized data-entry program which ensures 99.5 percent or greater data processing accuracy,  provide for data entry double-keying, data range checking, automated field arrangement, padding, embedding, justification, repetition of, or skipping of user-defined fields, mixed alpha/numeric field processing, creation and reorganization of the digitized data entry product.  NEPEC will supply the vendor with a blank copy of the survey form along with its associated  allowable value list,  as the basis upon which data entry program(s) will be constructed and upon which programming and data entry accuracy will be based.
NEPEC considers the creation, development, implementation and maintenance of the data entry programs to be so significant to the DPP as to designate the data entry programs  performance separate from the data entry itself.  Consequently, the data entry programs  performance regarding a particular survey form must be certified as accurate by the vendor and by NEPEC before data entry can proceed.  The performance of the data entry programs will be judged by the processing of one or more  test batches  of sample survey forms submitted by NEPEC, which will then be checked and certified as accurate by the vendor.  Test batches will range from 10 to 30 forms.  There will be no separate fee for the processing of test batches. ( All test batches shall be included in the pricing schedule)  NEPEC will then use its own means to verify the accuracy of the test batches and will concur with the vendor s certification when accuracy and performance is achieved.  Acceptance of the data entry program product will occur after certification, and will include program maintenance and support throughout the contract period.
All of NEPEC s survey forms, documentation materials,  allowable value  lists and other materials are subject to errors and omissions.  NEPEC endeavors to provide the most accurate, up-to-date materials, but from time to time will require modifications of data entry programs.  Modifications, up to and including 10% of the survey form and its  allowable value list  which require subsequent modification of the data entry programs may be requested at any time during the contract period without incurring additional programming charges or requiring amendments to this contract.
NEPEC requires that the vendor produce the data entry program product, ready for testing, specific to any given forms within one business day from its submission.  On occasion, these deadlines may be subject to adjustment as agreed between NEPEC and the vendor, based upon NEPEC s project priority and current vendor workload.
2.   Data Entry and Forms Management:  The Contractor shall provide Data Entry from a number of survey forms supplied by NEPEC, which are typically column-coded, but which may also be free-form, or irregularly coded depending upon NEPEC s needs.  Since NEPEC is composed of many  evaluation divisions , each of which has similarly appearing forms, it is essential that the vendor use methods which guarantee that the evaluation divisions  forms and their resultant digitized products not be commingled during data entry, transportation and storage.  NEPEC will provide the vendor with unique names to use when referencing evaluation division, forms, and the digitized products according to an established  name spacing  convention.
The vendor shall provide a means for error detection concurrent with data entry such that the data entry operator can provide a clearly visible indicator or the error on the form itself.  This is accomplished by identification of each range error and unacceptable data on the physical form by  tagging  (i.e., using small yellow self-adhesive notes) the form at the point of error with a brief description of the error, (i.e.,  column 26 out of range ,  left blank , etc.).
The digitized data entry product (DPP) consists of a single ASCII flat file for each form processed.  The file shall be self-encrypted using software such as 7-zip, optionally on CD media, but primarily returned via self-encrypted, password protected e-mail from the vendor to NEPEC. The cost for DPP shall be borne by the vendor, and incorporated into the cost associated for routine processing of a form.
ASCII files shall be named according to the file name spacing convention, and are associated with an accurate file creation date.  The file name spacing convention used by NEPEC takes the form of:
PpFFmmDDyyyy.DAT, where:
Pp=NEPEC program namespace for the project
FF=form designation for this project
mm=month of file creation, numeric 01 to 12
DD=day of file creation, numeric 01 to 31
yyyy=four digit year of file creation 2017 to present
.=file separator
DAT=NEPEC suffix designation data type
For example, the file  HVFB0901.DAT  indicates this file contains raw data ( .DAT ) for the NEPEC program namespace ( HV ), that the digitized data is derived from survey form B ( FB ), and that this file was created on September 1.
Files shall be archived for the duration of this contract.  NEPEC will require at times copies of certain archive files to replace original copies.  Requests for archive files will be granted without surcharge.  All archived data are owned by NEPEC, and at the completion of the DPP for a particular form, at the termination of the overall DPP, or at the completion of this contract the vendor will surrender the entire archive to NEPEC, and will certify in writing that no additional copies exist and that data has been removed entirely from the Vendor s equipment, operations, archives and processes.
NEPEC requires that the vendor complete data entry for a given form within a maximum of three business days from its submission for jobs as defined by one crate.  Completion of data entry for more than one crate will be within 5 business days.  On occasion, this deadline may be subject to adjustment as agreed between NEPEC and the vendor, based upon NEPEC s project priority and current vendor workload.
All collection services need to be within the continental United States.
3.   Transportation of forms and products:  forms comprising the DPP are placed in boxes or crates for transportation to, and from the vendor.  These forms are filed sequentially in a manner which has great importance to the efficient forms management operations of NEPEC s evaluation divisions.  It is essential that the vendor preserve form-filing sequence when performing data entry and during transportation of all DPP forms.
The vendor is responsible for initiating and maintaining a system for transportation of all forms and products.  All costs associated with the transportation of the forms shall be the responsibility of the vendor.  Transportation of forms and products must be done in a manner that keeps all items safe and secure.  NEPEC will not be responsible for payment to vendor for any items lost during transportation and vendor shall be required to reimburse NEPEC for costs due to the loss of items during transportation.  Time required for transportation will not affect completion deadlines for forms and products.
All pick ups and deliveries shall be done between the hours of 8:00am and 4:30pm Monday through Friday, excluding federal holidays.
4.   Forms included in this contract:  Forms listed on the pricing pages are the forms used by NEPEC s evaluation divisions.  This list includes the form designation, number of columns comprising the form, the estimated quantity of forms, and the estimated keystrokes to be processed for the duration of the contract. The following is the expected number of forms to be provided follows: 
Form A2   5000 
Form D2   4500 
Form F2   3000 
VSS Survey   11,000
All forms are provided as an attachment.
In order to aid the vendor in estimating the costs for the DPP, included is an example of a column coded style form (Attachment 2), representative of the forms currently used at NEPEC.  The column-coded style is used by approximately 90 percent of the forms.  The column-coded style primarily uses numbers as allowable values (approx 90%), but may also require mixed case, date formatting and mixed alpha and numeric fields requiring range checks (approx. 10%).  
NEPEC has made every effort to achieve accuracy in the above list, however, please note that the number of columns may vary by +/-3 percent.  Additionally, expected quantities are estimates and are dependent on factors beyond NEPEC s control.

Submit quotations to the office specified in this solicitation at or before the exact time specified in this solicitation. Quotations must be submitted as specified in the solicitation. As a minimum, quotations must show-<br />(1) The solicitation number;<br />(2) The time specified in the solicitation for receipt of quotations;<br />(3) The name, address, and telephone number of the quoter;<br />(4) A technical description of the items being quoted in sufficient detail to evaluate compliance with the requirements in the solicitation.

Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

<p>(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and</p>
<p>(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.</p>
<p>(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venture, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.</p>
<p>(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.</p>
<p>(d) Remedies.

If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.</p>
<p>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.</p>
<p>(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.</p>
<p>(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof.

<p>NOAA Acquisition Alert Notification</p>
<p>NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)</p>
<p>a.	The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1.	Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2.	Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3.	Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b.	The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c.	Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d.	There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1.	Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A&bull;76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4.	The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5.	The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6.	The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7.	The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>
<p>e.	After review and analysis of a filed concern or recommendation, the AGO Ombudsman may refer the interested party to another more suitable federal official for consideration. Moreover, concerns, disagreements, and/or recommendations that cannot be resolved by the AGO Ombudsman will need to be pursued through more formal venues.</p>
<p>f.	The AGO Ombudsman is not to be contacted to request copies of forms and/or documents under the purview of a contracting officer. Such documents include Requests for Information, solicitations, amendments, contracts, modifications, or conference materials.</p>
<p>g.	Questions regarding this solicitation and contract language shall be directed to Rafael Roman, NOAA AGO Ombudsman, at Rafael.Roman@noaa.gov.  <br />(End of solicitation and contract language)</p>
<p>(xvi) Defense Priorities and Allocations Systems (DPAS) and assigned ratings is not applicable.</p>
<p>(xvii) Offers shall be submitted electronically via email to beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov no later than 1000 hrs PST, March 8, 2018.</p>
<p>(xviii) Contact Beverly J. Parker at (541) 867-8730 or beverly.j.parker@noaa.gov for information regarding this solicitation.</p>

<DESC>Charlotte Lake Back Country Packing for 2018

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Quotations, RFQ # 140P8618R0009 and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-81, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This service category falls under NAICS  713990 All Other Amusement and Recreation Industries. The Government intends to issue a firm-fixed price contract to a single vendor determined to be responsive and responsible. The Government will consider price and past performance in determining responsibility. We reserve the right to cancel this solicitation. This solicitation is open to all competition.

The National Park Service (NPS) Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks has several work projects scheduled on the Rae Lakes Loop/JMT in 2018.   In support of these projects, camp gear, food, tools, and other material will be packed in by mule via the Bubbs Creek Drainage to various locations along the drainage including Charlotte Lake. The duration of packing needs under this contract will be based on snow levels and access to the backcountry camp locations, weekly crew needs, and project scheduling: it is anticipated that between 8 to 10 mule loads will be needed for weekly resupply from when snow levels allow access (approximately late May to late June) to stock through September 25, 2018.

<p>(c) If, subsequent to the date of this contract, the security classification or security requirements under this contract are changed by the Government and if the changes cause an increase or decrease in security costs or otherwise affect any other term or condition of this contract, the contract shall be subject to an equitable adjustment as if the changes were directed under the Changes clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(d) The Contractor agrees to insert terms that conform substantially to the language of this clause, including this paragraph (d) but excluding any reference to the Changes clause of this contract, in all subcontracts under this contract that involve access to classified information.</p>

<p>"Predecessor" means an entity that is replaced by a successor and includes any predecessors of the predecessor.</p>
<p>"Successor" means an entity that has replaced a predecessor by acquiring the assets and carrying out the affairs of the predecessor under a new name (often through acquisition or merger).

<p>(b) The Offeror may submit one or more additional proposals with alternative line items, provided that alternative line items are consistent with subpart 4.10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; and<br />(ii) Price;</p>
<p>Technical is approximately equal to price.</p>
<p>(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror, within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party.

(vi) BRAND NAME OR EQUAL PRODUCTS
In accordance with VAAR 811.104-71 (b), based on the inclusion of FAR 52.211-6, Brand Name or Equal (AUG 1999) and VAAR 852.211-73, Brand Name or Equal (JAN 2008), offerors proposing to furnish an  equal product other than referenced in the solicitation, shall insert the following description for each equal product (See also VAAR 852.211-73 (c)(1) and (c)(2).

Manufacturers
Name: ____________________________________________________________________________.

Brand: _______________________________________________________________________

Model No.:____________________________________________________________________
Comparable products must be brand name or equal containing the following salient features:

This device is utilized for standardized and quantitative stress examinations of the ankle (Anterior Drawer/Lateral, Talar Tilt/AP, Syndesmosis Joint and Subtalar Joint), knee (Anterior Cruciate Ligament, Posterior Cruciate Ligament and Collateral Ligaments), elbow (Ulnar Collateral Ligament) and shoulder (Glenohumeral Joint, both anterior and posterior stress applications).

This device provides a known amount of pressure that is illuminated by LED readout, allowing the user / requestor to determine exactly the amount of stress to be applied to the joint. This also allows standardization of pressure pre- and post- operative imaging, which cannot be accomplished with hand applied pressure. 

This device will eliminate additional radiation exposure to those who currently hold the patient. With this device, patients will be better served and the orthopedic staff will not need to be involved in the process of obtaining images.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation and request for quote (RFQ) for commercial items in accordance with the procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Part 13 - Simplified Acquisition Procedures, with FAR Part 12 taking precedence per FAR 13.500(b)'s reference to FAR 12.102(c). This announcement constitutes the only solicitation with quotes requested.
<p>This requirement is unrestricted under NAICS code 519130, Internet Publishing and Broadcasting and Web Search Portals with a size standard of 500 employees; therefore, any qualified, responsible vendor may submit a quote.</p>
<p>Questions, Suggested Alternate Terms, and Answers<br />Quoters are invited to submit any questions or suggested alternate terms (including changes to the solicitation, contract clauses, statement of assumptions, or other terms). FHFA will consider all input and attempt to balance the needs of all parties.</p>
<p>Questions or other suggested changes must be submitted by 2PM Eastern Time (ET), March 6, 2018 by email to Deirdre.Eischens@fhfa.gov Questions, any written responses, or amendments will be posted at www.FBO.gov.</p>
<p><strong>FAR References</strong><br />Any FAR clauses or provisions referenced may be obtained at www.acquisition.gov/far. Also, any reference to offeror or offer has the same meaning as quoter or quote for this solicitation. The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-97 / January 24, 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Submission Instructions</strong></p>
<p>Quoters shall be registered in the System for Award Management as stated in FAR 52.212-1(k) to be eligible for award.</p>
<p>Each Quoter shall submit an electronic quotation (Volumes I and Volume II in separate files) to Deirdre.Eischens@fhfa.gov.</p>
<p>The electronic quotation shall include any scanned copies of signatures associated with the quotation.</p>
<p>Each email quotation including attachments cannot exceed 50 MB because it may be rejected by FHFA's server. If your entire quotation exceeds 50MB in size, please divide your quotation into appropriate smaller emails.</p>
<p>If a Quoter chooses to submit a quotation, the quote must remain valid for a minimum of 120 calendar days.</p>
<p>Quotes are due no later than 2PM ET, March 19, 2018. Late submissions, modifications, and revisions will be managed in accordance with FAR 52.212-1(f).</p>
<p>If Quoters take exception to any of the terms (including the attached contract clauses), include assumptions; or do not conform to the RFQ's submission instructions, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to reject the quotation to ensure fairness to the other Quoters.</p>
<p>All quotations must include a cover page addressing the following information:<br />1. RFQ Number<br />2. Quoter's Name<br />3. Quoter Tax Identification Number (TIN)<br />4. Quoter Dun &amp; Bradstreet Number (DUNS)<br />5. Contact Name<br />6. Contact Email address<br />7. Contact telephone number<br />8. Complete business mailing address<br />9. The following statement "The Quoter takes no exception and completely accepts all the terms and conditions in the RFQ and subsequent amendments."</p>
<p><strong>Volume I: Technical Quotation<br /><br /></strong>The Quoter's technical submission should demonstrate the firm's capability to perform the work requirements outlined in the Attachment A. Volume I shall include separate sections within the volume outlining the following items:</p>
<p><strong>Factor 1: Technical Approach</strong></p>
<p>Quoters shall describe in narrative form their capability to fulfill the overall requirements of the Statement of Work (SOW) (see Attachment B). The Government will evaluate the extent to which the Quote demonstrates an understanding of and ability to meet the requirements identified in Sections 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 in the SOW. A quote that fails to demonstrate that a particular requirement can be met will result in a negative evaluation finding, but will not necessarily render the quote unacceptable. The Quoter shall also provide background materials and samples of credit research, analysis, and relevant data evidencing the capability to perform all tasks described in the SOW. As part of its evaluation, the Government will consider the amount of historical data that is relevant to the requirements identified in the SOW. Quoters shall identify the time period of available data for each of the six market sectors.</p>
<p>FHFA may, at its sole discretion, conduct vendor demonstrations so that FHFA obtains a better understanding of the website's online functionality and capabilities. If conducted, Quoters shall demo their web-based research and relevant information including specific features, functionality, and capabilities to support a wide coverage of individual counterparties and structured finance securities within each of the six market sectors specified in the SOW. Quoters shall also demonstrate how to search for and download credit research, analysis, and relevant data for each of the six market sectors from their websites.</p>
<p>The vendor demonstration, if conducted, will be evaluated as part of the Quoter's technical quotation. During demonstrations neither FHFA nor the Quoter will use the demonstration to discuss or negotiate changes to the initial written quotation, terms and conditions of the solicitation, or prices.</p>
<p>If Quoter demonstrations are conducted, the Contracting Officer will provide as much notice as practical to schedule the demonstration and provide relevant details regarding the format of the presentation, including specific instructions for a demonstration or other presentation details. Quoters will be notified in writing of the date and time for their specific demonstration. The demonstrations may be held at FHFA headquarters in Washington, DC or online. If conducted in person, the number of attendees is limited to five. The demonstrations will be limited to 75 minutes in duration whether in-person or online. Any set-up of visual aids and remarks made by the Contracting Officer prior to the demonstration will not count against the Quoter's time limit of 75 minutes. If conducted online, the Contracting Officer will notify the Quoter of the request for an online demonstration.</p>
<p>The Government may conduct exchanges at the conclusion of the demonstration. However, the Government also reserves the right to make award without exchanges. If the Government decides to conduct exchanges at the conclusion of the presentation, the response by the vendor will constitute a component of the technical quote. Exchanges may also be conducted in writing by the Contracting Officer before or after the presentation dates. Vendors may be given an opportunity to submit a revised quote after the conclusion of the demonstration and/or exchanges.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that vendor demonstrations will take place during the period March 19, 2018 through March 27, 2018. The dates are subject to change at the discretion of the Government. <br /><br />It is at the Contracting Officer's discretion to reschedule the date and time for a demonstration if requested by the Quoter, but FHFA is under no obligation to permit alternate times, if the Quoter is unable to attend at the scheduled time.</p>
<p>Page Limitation. Excluding cover pages, the technical quotation (including all non-price factors) is limited to 25 pages. The page limitation excludes excel spreadsheet attachments and samples of credit research information. In addition, Quoters shall provide the names of individual counterparties and structured finance securities in an excel file. The font and format should be of readable quality. Excessively small font may be rejected or not evaluated at the Contracting Officer's discretion.</p>
<p>Quoters shall not include any price information in the technical quotation. For the overall technical quotation, a recitation or paraphrasing of the requirements already identified in the work requirements will not improve the quotation.</p>
<p><strong>Volume II- Price Quotation</strong></p>
<p>Price Quotation: The vendor shall complete the Pricing Tables located in Attachment A. The price quotation shall include a firm-fixed price for each line item requested in Attachment A, including options. Quoters may quote a single firm-fixed price for access to the three insurance market sectors or a single price for each sector. Quoters shall submit a price quotation separate from the technical quotation (Volume I). The quote shall include pricing for the base year and each option year. The total evaluated price shall be calculated as the sum of all line items, including option quantities and option years. <br /><br />The Government may determine that a quoted price is unacceptable if the option prices are unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise those options during performance.</p>
<p>Page Limitation. There is no page limitation on the price quote submission.</p>
<p>Quoters shall submit representations and certifications per FAR 52.212-3 (see FAR 52.212-3(b) for those representations and certifications that the quoter shall complete electronically).</p>
<p>License Agreements/Terms of Use Agreements: Quoters shall submit their End User License Agreements (EULA) or Terms of Use Agreement, preferably a Federal government version, as part of Volume I. Quoters shall adhere to the Statement of Work Section 6.0 for specific guidance related to the license agreements.</p>
<p><strong>EVALUATION AND SELECTION PROCESS</strong></p>
<p>Since this award is made under the policies of FAR Part 12 in conjunction with FAR Part 13 procedures, the evaluation process is streamlined, and FHFA has considerable flexibility in its award decision. FHFA will evaluate the quotation considering positive attributes, negative attributes, and potential risk of the overall quotation.</p>
<p>During the evaluation process, FHFA may or may not conduct exchanges. If FHFA conducts exchanges, such exchanges may be with one, several, or all Quoters. Exchanges may vary based on FHFA's need to understand or give the Quoters an opportunity to improve their quotations, but all exchanges will be fair and equitable.</p>
<p>Following an evaluation and, where appropriate, tradeoff analysis, FHFA may make one award based on the quote that is evaluated to be the best value and determined responsible. While not guaranteed, at the current time, FHFA intends to make one contract award.</p>
<p>FHFA reserves the right to make an award based on other than the lowest quoted price. <br />Technical Approach including Vendor Demonstrations, if conducted, (Volume I) is more important than price (Volume II); however, the importance of price as a factor could become greater if competing quotations are evaluated as technically equal.</p>

<DESC><p>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. <br />(ii) The solicitation number is 70T05018Q7NHNL003 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ). The acquisition is being conducted as a simplified acquisition pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.5.<br />(iii) The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-96/ 11-6-2017.<br />(iv) The acquisition is set-aside for small businesses. The associated NAICS code is 517110 with a small business size standard of 1,500 employees. <br />(v) A list of line item numbers and items, estimated quantities, and units of measure (including options) is included as an attachment to this announcement.<br />(vi) The requirement is for badges and badge accessories. This includes pocket badges, tactical badges, leather commission books, leather badge holders, Lucite commemorative badges, badge refurbishment services, and badge destruction services.<br />(vii) The contract will be written with a one year base period and one option period of one year. <br />Base Period: March 11, 2018-March 10, 2019</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition. The following addenda apply:<br />Paragraph (h) "Multiple Awards" is deleted. The Government will award a single purchase order (PO) contract as a result of this solicitation.</p>
<p>Paragraph (m) is added as follows:<br />"(m) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS). Quoters shall include their DUNS number in their quote." <br />(ix) The provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items does not apply. The following evaluation procedures will be used:<br />Award will be made using a lowest price technically acceptable (LPTA) selection process. Award may be made on initial quotations. Therefore, each initial quote should contain the quoter's best terms from a technical and price standpoint. However, the Government reserves the right to contact quoters if it is later determined by the contracting officer to be necessary. The LPTA process will proceed as follows:</p>
<p>1) Quotes may be removed from consideration for, but not limited to, the following reasons:</p>
<p>Quotes that are not received timely<br />Quotes that fail to follow the instructions in FAR Provision 52.212-1<br />Quotes that fail to submit any required documentation <br />Quotes that have language inconsistent with the terms and conditions set forth in the solicitation</p>
<p>2) Quotes will be ordered by price from lowest to highest.</p>
<p>3) The Government will then review Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 1 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, the Government will then evaluate Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote. If the review finds that Factor 2 of the lowest priced quote is acceptable, that quote represents the best value to the Government and the technical evaluation process stops at this point. Contingent upon a subsequent determination of price reasonableness and of contractor responsibility by the Contracting Officer, an award will be made to that quoter without further consideration of any other quoters.</p>
<p>If the lowest quote is determined not to be acceptable for any reason, then the next lowest priced quote will receive an evaluation as described above. The process will continue (in order by price) until a quote from a responsible contractor is determined to be acceptable and priced fairly and reasonably.</p>
<p>4) USING THIS PROCEDURE, THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT NOT EVALUATE ALL QUOTES.</p>
<p>(e) Each Factor will be evaluated as follows:</p>
<p>Factor 1. Technical Acceptability</p>
<p>Technical Acceptability will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis as follows:</p>
<p>Acceptable - A quoter will be determined technically acceptable based on their affirmation that they can supply all contract line items as detailed in the contract specifications without deviation. The affirmation shall be supported by the technical description submission required by FAR 52.212-1(b)(4).</p>
<p>Unacceptable - A quoter will be determined technically unacceptable in absence of an affirmation that they can supply all contract line items as detailed in the contract specifications without deviation, or the affirmation is not supported by the technical submission required by FAR 52.212-1(b)(4).</p>
<p><br />Factor 2. Price</p>
<p>Price will not be rated. Price analysis will be conducted to determine reasonableness.</p>
<p>(x) Quoters are required to include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications -- Commercial Items with its quote. Quoters shall complete only paragraph (b) of this provision if they have completed the annual representations and certification electronically via the System for Award Management (SAM) Web site accessed through http://www.acquisition.gov. If the Quoter has not completed the annual representations and certifications electronically, it shall complete only paragraphs (c) through (q) of this provision.</p>

The parties are a DoD Military Health System (MHS) component, acting as a HIPAA covered entity, and a DoD contractor, acting as a HIPAA business associate. The HIPAA Rules require BAAs between covered entities and business associates. Implementing this BAA requirement, the applicable DoD HIPAA Issuance (DoD 6025.18-R, paragraph C3.4.1.3) provides that requirements applicable to business associates must be incorporated (or incorporated by reference) into the contract or agreement between the parties.<br />(a) Catchall Definition. Except as provided otherwise in this BAA, the following terms used in this BAA shall have the same meaning as those terms in the DoD HIPAA Rules: Data Aggregation, Designated Record Set, Disclosure, Health Care Operations, Individual, Minimum Necessary, Notice of Privacy Practices (NoPP), Protected Health Information (PHI), Required By Law, Secretary, Security Incident, Subcontractor, Unsecured Protected Health Information, and Use.<br />-Breach means actual or possible loss of control, unauthorized disclosure of or unauthorized access to PHI or other PII (which may include, but is not limited to PHI), where persons other than authorized users gain access or potential access to such information for any purpose other than authorized purposes, where one or more individuals will be adversely affected. The foregoing definition is based on the definition of breach in DoD Privacy Act Issuances as defined herein.<br />-Business Associate shall generally have the same meaning as the term "business associate" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of Business Associate signatory to this BAA].<br />-Agreement means this BAA together with the documents and/or other arrangements under which the Business Associate signatory performs services involving access to PHI on behalf of the MHS component signatory to this BAA.<br />-Covered Entity shall generally have the same meaning as the term "covered entity" in the DoD HIPAA Issuances, and in reference to this BAA, shall mean [insert name of MHS component signatory to this BAA].<br />-DHA Privacy Office means the DHA Privacy and Civil Liberties Office. The DHA Privacy Office Director is the HIPAA Privacy and Security Officer for DHA, including the National Capital Region Medical Directorate (NCRMD).<br />-DoD HIPAA Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the HIPAA Rules in the DoD Military Health System (MHS). These issuances are DoD 6025.18-R (2003), DoDI 6025.18 (2009), and DoD 8580.02-R (2007).<br />-DoD Privacy Act Issuances means the DoD issuances implementing the Privacy Act, which are DoDD 5400.11 (2007) and DoD 5400.11-R (2007).<br />-HHS Breach means a breach that satisfies the HIPAA Breach Rule definition of breach in 45 CFR 164.402.<br />-HIPAA Rules means, collectively, the HIPAA Privacy, Security, Breach and Enforcement Rules, issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and codified at 45 CFR Part 160 and Part 164, Subpart E (Privacy), Subpart C (Security), Subpart D (Breach) and Part 160, Subparts C-D (Enforcement), as amended by the 2013 modifications to those Rules, implementing the "HITECH Act" provisions of Pub. L. 111-5. See 78 FR 5566-5702 (Jan. 25, 2013) (with corrections at 78 FR 32464 (June 7, 2013)). Additional HIPAA rules regarding electronic transactions and code sets (45 CFR Part 162) are not addressed in this BAA and are not included in the term HIPAA Rules.<br />-Service-Level Privacy Office means one or more offices within the military services (Army, Navy, or Air Force) with oversight authority over Privacy Act and HIPAA privacy compliance.<br />I. Obligations and Activities of Business Associate<br />1<br />(a) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI other than as permitted or required by the Agreement or as required by law.<br />(b) The Business Associate shall use appropriate safeguards, and comply with the DoD HIPAA Rules with respect to electronic PHI, to prevent use or disclosure of PHI other than as provided for by the Agreement.<br />(c) The Business Associate shall report to Covered Entity any Breach of which it becomes aware, and shall proceed with breach response steps as required by Part V of this BAA. With respect to electronic PHI, the Business Associate shall also respond to any security incident of which it becomes aware in accordance with any Information Assurance provisions of the Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate becomes aware that a security incident involves a Breach, the Business Associate shall immediately initiate breach response as required by part V of this BAA.<br />(d) In accordance with 45 CFR 164.502(e)(1)(ii)) and 164.308(b)(2), respectively), as applicable, the Business Associate shall ensure that any subcontractors that create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of the Business Associate agree to the same restrictions, conditions, and requirements that apply to the Business Associate with respect to such PHI.<br />(e) The Business Associate shall make available PHI in a Designated Record Set, to the Covered Entity or, as directed by the Covered Entity, to an Individual, as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity obligations under 45 CFR 164.524.<br />(f) The Business Associate shall make any amendment(s) to PHI in a Designated Record Set as directed or agreed to by the Covered Entity pursuant to 45 CFR 164.526, or take other measures as necessary to satisfy Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.526.<br />(g) The Business Associate shall maintain and make available the information required to provide an accounting of disclosures to the Covered Entity or an individual as necessary to satisfy the Covered Entity's obligations under 45 CFR 164.528.<br />(h) To the extent the Business Associate is to carry out one or more of Covered Entity's obligation(s) under the HIPAA Privacy Rule, the Business Associate shall comply with the requirements of HIPAA Privacy Rule that apply to the Covered Entity in the performance of such obligation(s); and<br />(i) The Business Associate shall make its internal practices, books, and records available to the Secretary for purposes of determining compliance with the HIPAA Rules.<br />II. Permitted Uses and Disclosures by Business Associate<br />(a) The Business Associate may only use or disclose PHI as necessary to perform the services set forth in the Agreement or as required by law. The Business Associate is not permitted to de-identify PHI under DoD HIPAA issuances or the corresponding 45 CFR 164.514(a)-(c), nor is it permitted to use or disclose de- identified PHI, except as provided by the Agreement or directed by the Covered Entity.<br />(b) The Business Associate agrees to use, disclose and request PHI only in accordance with the HIPAA Privacy Rule "minimum necessary" standard and corresponding DHA policies and procedures as stated in the DoD HIPAA Issuances.<br />(c) The Business Associate shall not use or disclose PHI in a manner that would violate the DoD HIPAA Issuances or HIPAA Privacy Rules if done by the Covered Entity, except uses and disclosures for the Business Associate's own management and administration and legal responsibilities or for data aggregation services as set forth in the following three paragraphs.<br />(d) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate. The foregoing authority to use PHI does not apply to disclosure of PHI, which is covered in the next paragraph.<br />(e) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may disclose PHI for the proper management and administration of the Business Associate or to carry out the legal responsibilities of the Business Associate, provided that disclosures are required by law, or the Business Associate obtains reasonable assurances from the person to whom the PHI is disclosed that it will remain confidential and<br />1<br />used or further disclosed only as required by law or for the purposes for which it was disclosed to the person, and the person notifies the Business Associate of any instances of which it is aware in which the confidentiality of the information has been breached.<br />(f) Except as otherwise limited in the Agreement, the Business Associate may use PHI to provide Data Aggregation services relating to the Covered Entity's health care operations.<br />III. Provisions for Covered Entity to Inform Business Associate of Privacy Practices and Restrictions<br />(a) The Covered Entity shall provide the Business Associate with the notice of privacy practices that the Covered Entity produces in accordance with 45 CFR 164.520 and the corresponding provision of the DoD HIPAA Issuances.<br />(b) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any changes in, or revocation of, the permission by an Individual to use or disclose his or her PHI, to the extent that such changes affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.<br />(c) The Covered Entity shall notify the Business Associate of any restriction on the use or disclosure of PHI that the Covered Entity has agreed to or is required to abide by under 45 CFR 164.522, to the extent that such changes may affect the Business Associate's use or disclosure of PHI.<br />IV. Permissible Requests by Covered Entity<br />The Covered Entity shall not request the Business Associate to use or disclose PHI in any manner that would not be permissible under the HIPAA Privacy Rule or any applicable Government regulations (including without limitation, DoD HIPAA Issuances) if done by the Covered Entity, except for providing Data Aggregation services to the Covered Entity and for management and administrative activities of the Business Associate as otherwise permitted by this BAA.<br />V. Breach Response<br />(a) In general.<br />In the event of a breach of PII/PHI held by the Business Associate, the Business Associate shall follow the breach response requirements set forth in this Part V, which is designed to satisfy both the Privacy Act and HIPAA as applicable. If a breach involves PII without PHI, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuance breach response requirements only; if a breach involves PHI (a subset of PII), then the Business Associate shall comply with both Privacy Act and HIPAA breach response requirements. A breach involving PHI may or may not constitute an HHS Breach. If a breach is not an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate has no HIPAA breach response obligations. In such cases, the Business Associate must still comply with breach response requirements under the DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that a breach is an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with both the HIPAA Breach Rule and DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the DHA Privacy Office, regardless of whether the breach occurs at DHA or at one of the Service components. If the DHA Privacy Office determines that the breach does not constitute an HHS Breach, then the Business Associate shall comply with DoD Privacy Act Issuances, as directed by the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office.<br />The Business Associate shall contact the Covered Entity for guidance when the incident is not an HHS Breach.<br />This Part V is designed to satisfy the DoD Privacy Act Issuances and the HIPAA Breach Rule as implemented by the DoD HIPAA Issuances. In general, for breach response, the Business Associate shall report the breach to the Covered Entity, assess the breach incident, notify affected individuals, and take mitigation actions as applicable. Because DoD defines "breach" to include possible (suspected) as well as actual (confirmed) breaches, the Business Associate shall implement these breach response requirements immediately upon the Business Associate's discovery of a possible breach.<br />(b) Government Reporting Provisions<br />The Business Associate shall report the breach within one hour of discovery to the Covered Entity and to the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US CERT) -the other parties as deemed appropriate by the Covered Entity. The Business Associate is deemed to have discovered a breach as of the time a breach<br />1<br />(suspected or confirmed) is known, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have been known, to any person (other than the person committing it) who is an employee, officer or other agent of the Business Associate.<br />The Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report using the online form at https://forms.us- cert.gov/report/. Before submission to US-CERT, the Business Associate shall save a copy of the on-line report. After submission, the Business Associate shall record the US-CERT Reporting Number. Although only limited information about the breach may be available as of the one hour deadline for submission, the Business Associate shall submit the US-CERT report by the deadline. The Business Associate shall e-mail updated information as it is obtained, following the instructions at http://www.us-cert.gov/pgp/email.html.<br />The Business Associate shall provide a copy of the initial or updated US-CERT report to the -Covered Entity and the applicable Service-Level Privacy Office, if requested by either. Business Associate questions about US-CERT reporting shall be directed to the Covered Entity or Service-Level Privacy Office, not the US- CERT office.<br />The additional US Army and the US Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) reporting requirements are addressed in the PII Breach Reporting and Notification Policy. The latest version of this policy can be obtained from the Covered Entity or the MEDCOM Privacy Act/Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Office at: usarmy.jbsa.medcom.list.medcom-foia-users@mail.mil . If multiple beneficiaries are affected by a single event or related set of events, then a single reportable breach may be deemed to have occurred, depending on the circumstances. The Business Associate shall inform the Covered Entity as soon as possible if it believes that "single event" breach response is appropriate; the Covered Entity will determine how the Business Associate shall proceed and, if appropriate, consolidate separately reported breaches for purposes of Business Associate report updates, beneficiary notification, and mitigation.<br />When a Breach Report initially submitted is incomplete or incorrect due to unavailable information, or when significant developments require an update, the Business Associate shall submit a revised form or forms, stating the updated status and previous report date(s) and showing any revisions or additions in red text.<br />Examples of updated information the Business Associate shall report include, but are not limited to: confirmation on the exact data elements involved, the root cause of the incident, and any mitigation actions to include, sanctions, training, incident containment, follow-up, etc. The Business Associate shall submit these report updates promptly after the new information becomes available. Prompt reporting of updates is required to allow the Covered Entity to make timely final determinations on any subsequent notifications or reports. The Business Associate shall provide updates to the same parties as required for the initial Breach Report. The Business Associate is responsible for reporting all information needed by the Covered Entity to make timely and accurate determinations on reports to HHS as required by the HHS Breach Rule and reports to the Defense Privacy and Civil Liberties Office as required by DoD Privacy Act Issuances.<br />In the event the Business Associate is uncertain on how to apply the above requirements, the Business Associate shall consult with the Covered Entity (or the Service-Level Privacy Office, which will consult with the DHA Privacy Office as appropriate) when determinations on applying the above requirements are needed.<br />(c) Individual Notification Provisions<br />If the DHA Privacy Office determines that individual notification is required, the Business Associate shall<br />provide written notification to individuals affected by the breach as soon as possible, but no later than 10 working days after the breach is discovered and the identities of the individuals are ascertained. The 10 day period begins when the Business Associate is able to determine the identities (including addresses) of the individuals whose records were impacted.<br />The Business Associate's proposed notification to be issued to the affected individuals shall be submitted to the parties to which reports are submitted under paragraph V (a) for their review, and for approval by the DHA Privacy Office. Upon request, the Business Associate shall provide the DHA Privacy Office with the final text of the notification letter sent to the affected individuals. If different groups of affected individuals receive different notification letters, then the Business Associate shall provide the text of the letter for each group. (PII shall not be included with the text of the letter(s) provided.) Copies of further correspondence with affected individuals need not be provided unless requested by the Privacy Office. The Business Associate's notification to the individuals, at a minimum, shall include the following:<br />-The individual(s) must be advised of what specific data was involved. It is insufficient to simply state that PII has been lost. Where names, Social Security Numbers (SSNs) or truncated SSNs, and Dates of Birth (DOBs) are involved, it is critical to advise the individual that these data elements potentially have been<br />1<br />breached.<br />-The individual(s) must be informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the breach. The description should be sufficiently detailed so that the individual clearly understands how the breach occurred.<br />-The individual(s) must be informed of what protective actions the Business Associate is taking or the individual can take to mitigate against potential future harm. The notice must refer the individual to the current Federal Trade Commission (FTC) web site pages on identity theft and the FTC's Identity Theft Hotline, toll-free: 1-877-ID-THEFT (438-4338); TTY: 1-866-653-4261.<br />-The individual(s) must also be informed of any mitigation support services (e.g., one year of free credit monitoring, identification of fraud expense coverage for affected individuals, provision of credit freezes, etc.) that the Business Associate may offer affected individuals, the process to follow to obtain those services and the period of time the services will be made available, and contact information (including a phone number, either direct or toll-free, e-mail address and postal address) for obtaining more information.<br />Business Associates shall ensure any envelope containing written notifications to affected individuals are clearly labeled to alert the recipient to the importance of its contents, e.g., "Data Breach Information Enclosed," and that the envelope is marked with the identity of the Business Associate and/or subcontractor organization that suffered the breach. The letter must also include contact information for a designated POC to include, phone number, email address, and postal address.<br />If the Business Associate determines that it cannot readily identify, or will be unable to reach, some affected individuals within the 10 day period after discovering the breach, the Business Associate shall so indicate in the initial or updated Breach Report. Within the 10 day period, the Business Associate shall provide the approved notification to those individuals who can be reached. Other individuals must be notified within 10 days after their identities and addresses are ascertained. The Business Associate shall consult with the DHA Privacy Office, which will determine which media notice is most likely to reach the population not otherwise identified or reached. The Business Associate shall issue a generalized media notice(s) to that population in accordance with Privacy Office approval.<br />The Business Associate shall, at no cost to the government, bear any costs associated with a breach of PII/PHI that the Business Associate has caused or is otherwise responsible for addressing.<br />Breaches are not to be confused with security incidents (often referred to as cyber security incidents when electronic information is involved), which may or may not involve a breach of PII/PHI. In the event of a security incident not involving a PII/PHI breach, the Business Associate shall follow applicable DoD Information Assurance requirements under its Agreement. If at any point the Business Associate finds that a cyber security incident involves a PII/PHI breach (suspected or confirmed), the Business Associate shall immediately initiate the breach response procedures set forth here. The Business Associate shall also continue to follow any required cyber security incident response procedures to the extent needed to address security issues, as determined by DoD/DHA.<br />VI. Termination<br />(a) Termination. Noncompliance by the Business Associate (or any of its staff, agents, or subcontractors) with any requirement in this BAA may subject the Business Associate to termination under any applicable default or other termination provision of the Agreement.<br />(b) Effect of Termination.<br />(1) If the Agreement has records management requirements, the Business Associate shall handle such records in accordance with the records management requirements. If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, the records should be handled in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) below. If the Agreement has provisions for transfer of records and PII/PHI to a successor Business Associate, or if DHA gives directions for such transfer, the Business Associate shall handle such records and information in accordance with such Agreement provisions or DHA direction.<br />(2) If the Agreement does not have records management requirements, except as provided in the following paragraph (3), upon termination of the Agreement, for any reason, the Business Associate shall return or destroy all PHI received from the Covered Entity, or created or received by the Business Associate on behalf of the Covered Entity that the Business Associate still maintains in any form. This provision shall apply to PHI that is in the possession of subcontractors or agents of the Business Associate. The Business<br />1<br />Associate shall retain no copies of the PHI.<br />(3) If the Agreement does not have records management provisions and the Business Associate determines that returning or destroying the PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall provide to the Covered Entity notification of the conditions that make return or destruction infeasible. Upon mutual agreement of the Covered Entity and the Business Associate that return or destruction of PHI is infeasible, the Business Associate shall extend the protections of the Agreement to such PHI and limit further uses and disclosures of such PHI to those purposes that make the return or destruction infeasible, for so long as the Business Associate maintains such PHI.<br />VII. Miscellaneous<br />(a) Survival. The obligations of Business Associate under the "Effect of Termination" provision of this BAA shall survive the termination of the Agreement.<br />(b) Interpretation. Any ambiguity in the Agreement shall be resolved in favor of a meaning that permits the Covered Entity and the Business Associate to comply with the HIPAA Rules and the DoD HIPAA Rules.<br />TOBACCO FREE MEDICAL CAMPUS (TFMC)<br />In accordance with Army Regulation 600-63, paragraph 7-3, 14 April 2015; Operations Order 15-48 (Army Medical Command (MEDCOM) Tobacco Free Living - USAMEDCOM), 8 May 2015; and any Operations Order, regulation or other instruction implementing, defining or otherwise addressing the Tobacco Free Medical Campus (TFMC) on any military installation or DoD-controlled location, Contractor personnel are prohibited from using any tobacco product on or within any TFMC while performing under this contract.<br />TFMCs are established at each installation or DoD-controlled location and include: (1) any property or non- residential building that is operated, maintained or assigned to support medical activities, including but not limited to, hospitals, medical laboratories, outpatient clinics (including medical, dental, and veterinary facilities), or aid stations operating for the primary purpose of delivering medical care and services for DOD eligible beneficiaries and /or meeting the mission of the Army Medical Command; (2) all other facilities in which medical activities or administration take place, to include HQ MEDCOM and Defense Health Headquarters; (3) all internal roadways, sidewalks and parking lots; and (4) all sidewalks, parking lots and grounds external but adjacent to the building or related to the migratory corridors surrounding the medical facility. The Contractor shall obtain from the COR any orders, regulations, instructions or other documents implementing, defining or otherwise addressing the TFMC for any given installation or DoD-controlled location where Contractor personnel may perform under this contract and shall instruct Contractor personnel on the TFMC limitations for installations or DoD-controlled locations where they may perform under this contract.<br />Exclusion from Participation in Federal Health Care Programs (October 2015)<br />1. The Contractor shall not employ or contract with any individual or entity (hereinafter collectively referred to as "person") to provide items or services that will be included in invoices submitted to the Government under this contract if such person is listed on the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) List of Excluded Individuals and Entities (LEIE) or the TRICARE Sanctioned Provider List. The Government is legally prohibited from paying for provision of items or services by such<br />persons. The prohibition extends to services beyond direct patient care, such as services of persons in executive or leadership roles and administrative and management services, whether or not such services are billed separately. The LEIE may be found at http://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/exclusions.asp, and the TRICARE Sanctioned Provider list at http://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Access-Cost-Quality-and- Safety/Quality-And-Safety-of-Healthcare/Program-Integrity/Sanctioned-Providers. The LEIE and TRICARE Sanctioned Provider List are hereinafter collectively referred to as "the Lists."<br />2. Prior to start of contract performance, the Contractor shall (a) query the Lists to determine whether the name of any person the Contractor employs or contracts with to provide services or items for which payment may be made under this contract appears on the Lists, and (b) certify to the Contracting Officer that the Contractor has queried the Lists and no such names appear on either of the Lists.<br />3. During performance of the contract, and prior to persons other than those whose names were queried in accordance with paragraph 2, above, (hereinafter "new persons") providing services or items under the contract, the Contractor shall (a) query the Lists as in paragraph 2, and (b) certify to the Contracting Officer that the names of such new persons do not appear on either of the Lists.<br />4. The Contractor is advised that during performance of the contract, MTF personnel will perform a recurrent<br />1<br />recheck of the names of contractor personnel working in the MTF against the Lists, as specified in OTSG/MEDCOM Policy Memo 15-037. The Government will notify the Contractor in the event any contractor personnel working in the MTF appear on either of the Lists.<br />5. Should any person providing items or services under the contract appear on either of the Lists at any time during contract performance, the Contractor shall (a) in cases where the Contractor identified the person, notify the Contracting Officer, and (b) promptly remove that person from the contract.<br />6. Violation of any aspect of the above paragraphs shall be considered a material breach of the contract and may result in termination of the contract.<br />7.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time- consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).] <br />(1) Listed end products.<br />Listed End Product Listed Countries of Origin <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />___________________ ___________________ <br />(2) Certification. [If the Contracting Officer has identified end products and countries of origin in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision, then the offeror must certify to either (i)(2)(i) or (i)(2)(ii) by checking the appropriate block.] <br />[ ] (i) The offeror will not supply any end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. <br />[ ] (ii) The offeror may supply an end product listed in paragraph (i)(1) of this provision that was mined, produced, or manufactured in the corresponding country as listed for that product. The offeror certifies that it has made a good faith effort to determine whether forced or indentured child labor was used to mine, produce, or manufacture any such end product furnished under this contract. On the basis of those efforts, the offeror certifies that it is not aware of any such use of child labor. <br />(j) Place of manufacture. (Does not apply unless the solicitation is predominantly for the acquisition of manufactured end products.) For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly- <br />(1) o In the United States (Check this box if the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured in the United States exceeds the total anticipated price of offered end products manufactured outside the United States); or <br />(2) o Outside the United States. <br />(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Labor Standards(Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] <br />[ ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The services will be furnished at prices which are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(c)(2)(ii)) for the maintenance, calibration, or repair of such equipment; and <br />(iii) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract will be the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing the same equipment of commercial customers. <br />[ ] (2) Certain services as described in FAR 22.1003-4(d)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that- <br />(i) The services under the contract are offered and sold regularly to non-Governmental customers, and are provided by the offeror (or subcontractor in the case of an exempt subcontract) to the general public in substantial quantities in the course of normal business operations; <br />(ii) The contract services will be furnished at prices that are, or are based on, established catalog or market prices (see FAR 22.1003-4(d)(2)(iii)); <br />(iii) Each service employee who will perform the services under the contract will spend only a small portion of his or her time (a monthly average of less than 20 percent of the available hours on an annualized basis, or less than 20 percent of available hours during the contract period if the contract period is less than a month) servicing the Government contract; and <br />(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. <br />(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies- <br />(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Labor Standards wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and <br />(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. <br />(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to the SAM database to be eligible for award.) <br />(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). <br />(2) The TIN may be used by the Government to collect and report on any delinquent amounts arising out of the offeror's relationship with the Government (31 U.S.C. 7701(c)(3)). If the resulting contract is subject to the payment reporting requirements described in FAR 4.904, the TIN provided hereunder may be matched with IRS records to verify the accuracy of the offeror's TIN. <br />(3) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). <br />o TIN: ________________________________. <br />o TIN has been applied for. <br />o TIN is not required because: <br />o Offeror is a nonresident alien, foreign corporation, or foreign partnership that does not have income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and does not have an office or place of business or a fiscal paying agent in the United States; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of a foreign government; <br />o Offeror is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government. <br />(4) Type of organization. <br />o Sole proprietorship; <br />o Partnership; <br />o Corporate entity (not tax-exempt); <br />o Corporate entity (tax-exempt); <br />o Government entity (Federal, State, or local); <br />o Foreign government; <br />o International organization per 26 CFR 1.6049-4; <br />o Other ________________________________. <br />(5) Common parent. <br />o Offeror is not owned or controlled by a common parent; <br />o Name and TIN of common parent: <br />Name ________________________________. <br />TIN _________________________________. <br />(m) Restricted business operations in Sudan.

The government will evaluate information based on the following evaluation criteria: "(1) technical capability factor "meeting or exceeding the requirement, (2) past performance, and (3) price. 
(a) When evaluation factors are used, the contracting officer may insert a provision substantially the same as the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items, in solicitations for commercial items or comply with the procedures in 13.106 if the acquisition is being made using simplified acquisition procedures.

52.212-2 is used, paragraph (a) of the provision shall be tailored to the specific acquisition to describe the evaluation factors and relative importance of those factors.

Technical capability may be evaluated by how well the proposed products meet the Government requirement instead of predetermined sub factors. Solicitations for commercial items do not have to contain sub factors for technical capability when the solicitation adequately describes the item s intended use. A technical evaluation would normally include examination of such things as product literature, product samples (if requested), technical features and warranty provisions. Past performance shall be evaluated in accordance with the procedures in 13.106 or Subpart 15.3, as applicable. The contracting officer shall ensure the instructions provided in the provision at 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors  Commercial Items, and the evaluation criteria provided in the provision at 52.212-2, Evaluation Commercial Items, are in agreement.

Any additional hours needed by the Chaplaincy must be approved by the Contracting officer or COR as designated.

Ecclesiastical endorsements for Roman Catholics are issued only by the Archdiocese for the Military Service USA in Washington, DC. The endorsing official is Bishop Richard Higgins. Endorsements must be specifically for VA Chaplaincy. Endorsement for the Armed Forces on the military endorsement form (2088) is not acceptable for VA Chaplaincy. Endorsements for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, for the Association of Professional Chaplains or for other groups are not valid for VA.

Education:  A Master of Divinity from an accredited institution or the equivalent.   Equivalent education is a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution plus at least 70 graduate semester hours which included all of the following: at least 20 semester hours in pastoral ministry; 20 semester hours in any combination of theology, ethics, and philosophy of religion; 20 semester hours in the study of sacred writings, including the study of languages in which sacred writings are written; and 10 semester hours in religious history and/or world religions.

Spiritual care will be provided for patients and families, especially visitation with those awaiting surgery, dying patients, bereaved families, families of patients in crises, persons with ethical concerns, and persons who are depressed, lonely, or struggling with the health center environment.

The Senior Chaplain (CLC Chaplain)  and/or Hospice Chaplain will perform spiritual assessments on all incoming veterans within 48 hours of their admittance to the Community Living Center. This is to include care plan documentation in the veteran s medical record. The Priest will receive referrals from these Chaplains.

Spiritual care will also be provided for those in Hospice care at the CFA s Community Living Center (CLC) who request a priest.

After each death, a chaplain will be present, and accompany the deceased veteran from the building to the awaiting hearse/transport ensuring that the established procedures and honors are bestowed upon the veteran. If a priest is desired for last rites, the chaplaincy will ensure that the veteran receives this.

The priest, as do other chaplains, responds to emergencies or crises when pastoral care is appropriate. If called by the charge nurse, he/she will respond, and note the call in the monthly report.

When requested by the veteran, the priest provides counsel on medical ethical issues (such as advance directives) in the context of the patient s particular faith background.  Likewise, the Chaplain voices these ethical issues to the interdisciplinary team, or his/her Senior Chaplain in the CLC for further discussion with the interdisciplinary team.

As communication is key to understanding and addressing the specific needs of the veteran patient, the Chaplain must communicate effectively with persons of diverse race, culture, religious belief, nationality, and age.  Likewise, he/she must communicate effectively with persons having various types and degrees of disability.

Information Security
Security Clause: The C&A requirements do not apply and a security accreditation package is not required. However, the following is to be noted:

The contractor, their personnel, and their subcontractors shall be subject to the Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks regarding information and information system security as delineated in this contract.

1. GENERAL
Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.
2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS
a. A contractor/subcontractor shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA
information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.
b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with
VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.
c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.
d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.
e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor s employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.
3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE
a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).
b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the
contractor s/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.
c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.
d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use,
disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.
e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as
authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.
f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality,
privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.
g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.
h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.
i. The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.
j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.
k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.
l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.
4. SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a. The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.
b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.
c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.
d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.
5. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH
a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.
b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.
c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:
(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:
(a) Date of occurrence;
(b) Data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50 per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
(1) Notification;
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3) Data breach analysis;

(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.
6. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day s notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.
7. TRAINING
a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:
(1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;

<DESC><p>11. The purpose of this amendment is to:</p>
<p>a. answer questions submitted by potential offerors;<br />b. Provide a revised Performance Work Statement including technical exhibits;<br />c. Provide a revised Contract Line Item Number Structure;<br />d. Extend the closing date and time of the solicitation from 1 March 2018, 11:00 am (MTZ) to 5 March 2018, 2:00 pm (MTZ).</p>
<p>2. Question 1: Technical Exhibit 1 PRS Item 3 PWS Reference Para 5.4 states material destroyed shall not exceed &frac14;" in diameter after destruction. The NAID (National Association for Information Destruction) has a standard of 5/8" in diameter for material of all general business classifications including medical facilities (HIPAA entities). This threshold will most likely be unattainable by NAID certified companies bidding on the project.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 1: The standard listed in PWS Para 5.4 is the correct standard. "Destruction process shall utilize, at a minimum, a hammer mill or equivalent process to ensure destruction of material, with no opportunity for document reconstruction. The PRS has been revised to match the PWS. The hammer mill or equivalent is the method to reach the 5/8th inch standard.</strong></p>
<p>Question 2: Section 5.3 Hard Drive, Tapes, and Cell Phones Destruction of PWS dated 2/02/2018, paragraph a. allows for off-site destruction of these materials. The Pricing Sheet pages 1 and 2 states on-site destruction services. Most media destruction contracts allow for off-site destruction of these types of materials. Please clarify this conflict.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 2: PWS section 5.3 is correct. The pricing sheet (CLIN Structure) has been revised and is included as an attachment to this amendment.</strong></p>
<p>Question 3. Please confirm that all bidders on this solicitation are certified members of NAID. There are companies who are members of NAID but are not certified members and thus are not subjected to NAID audit requirements.</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 3: The requirement for NAID certification listed in the combined synopsis solicitation has been added to the PWS in paragraph 1.6.13. All offerors must meet this requirement.</strong></p>
<p>Question 4. I have an additional question for clarification. Is this a Best Value or Lowest Technical Acceptable Price (LTAP) solicitation?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 4: See FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation of Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose technically acceptable offer conforming to the solicitation is the lowest price.</strong></p>
<p>Question 5. Reference PRS Item 3: Commercial shredding trucks are not capable of shredding to a guaranteed size of &frac14;" in diameter after destruction.</p>
<p>Our solution which has been acceptable to other military medical facilities is as follows:</p>
<p>The final outcome of materials is rendered essentially unreadable or indecipherable and</p>
<p>otherwise unable to be reconstructed.</p>
<p>Will that standard be acceptable for the required service for this contract?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 5: The standard listed in PWS Para 5.4 is the correct standard. "Destruction process shall utilize, at a minimum, a hammer mill or equivalent process to ensure destruction of material, with no opportunity for document reconstruction. " The PRS will be revised to match the PWS. </strong></p>
<p>Question 6. What does item no. 7 in the pricing pertain to?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 6: See PWS paragraph 5.13. The CLIN structure has been changed to reflect the correct PWS paragraph.</strong></p>
<p>Question 7. Is this a sole source opportunity?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 7: No. See FAR 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Set-Aside.</strong></p>
<p>Question 8. Can media and paper shredding be separated?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 8: No. </strong></p>
<p>Question 9. Can we bid solely on media?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 9: No.</strong></p>
<p>Question 10. Can you estimate the number of shred events per year for media?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER: Based on historical data, the number is four.</strong></p>
<p>Question 11. Is an extension possible?</p>
<p><strong>ANSWER TO QUESTION 11: The closing date and time is hereby extended to March 5, 2018, 2:00 pm (MTZ). </strong></p>
<p>3. The revised CLIN structure and the revised PWS (including Technical Exhibits) are attached to this amendment.</p>
<p>4. The closing date and time is hereby extended to March 5, 2018, 2:00 pm (MTZ).</p>

Connects to wireless heart rate monitors and via bluetooth to the optional ErgData app to track detailed workout data. The monitor itself can be custom positioned using the adjustable monitor arm. USB flash drive compatible and built for machine-to-machine racing.
The Concept 2 uses air resistance generated by the fanned flywheel. To adjust how much air enters the flywheel housing on each stroke, the Model D Rower includes a unique spiral damper adjustable from a setting of 1 to 10. This functions much like the gears on a bike, affecting how much energy will be needed to accelerate from one stroke to the next. 10 allows in the most air for more wind resistance. For most people the recommended settings is from 3-5.
Designed to last, the Concept 2 rowing machines offer a comprehensive fully transferable warranty. From home gyms, to Olympic training centers, to major professional sports teams, Concept 2 has been put to the test time and again.
The Model D is mobile, and easy to store. You can quickly breakdown the entire unit into two compact sections using the quick release, framelock mechanism (no tools needed), and caster wheels enable the easy movement of the entire rower from one end of a gym to the other.

<p>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB), plans to procure on a competitive basis a Violet laser upgrade kit for NxT Attune Flow Cytometer. <br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items, prepared in accordance with format in FAR 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a separate written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation: No. N02RC82526-73 includes all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through FAR FAC 2005-97 (JAN 2018) simplified procedures for commercial items. <br /><br />The North American Industry Classification System code is 334516 and the business size standard is 1000 employees.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>I. Description of Requirement</p>
<p>One aspect of the Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology (LTIB) studies is identifying and quantifying the impact of the LTIB various treatments on the phenotype of tumor cells using flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis allows the LTIB to ascertain changes in abundance of proteins expressed by the tumor after treatment with various compounds, enabling us to identify compounds which having the potential to enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to lysis by tumor-reactive lymphocytes. The lab also measures the effects these compounds have on components of the immune system. Flow cytometric analysis allows the LTIB to ascertain any changes in populations of lymphocytes in circulation, primary/secondary lymphoid tissues, and within the tumor microenvironment after treatment with various modalities. The violet laser upgrade of the Attune NxT Acoustic Focusing Cytometer will help the LTIB to achieve an essential aspect of the research program, which aims to provide the pre-clinical rationale for all of the clinical trials performed by the laboratory within the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>As part of the research effort, the violet laser upgrade for the Attune NxT flow cytometer will expand the functionality of an existing two-laser Attune NxT flow cytometer within the LTIB. The violet laser upgrade of the Attune NxT flow cytometer will allow the incorporation of an additional six detection channels, which will allow the LTIB to assay the expression of an additional six proteins being expressed by the cells being analyzed. This type of multi-parameter analysis will provide clearer insight into how these proteins can change the phenotype of cells, and allow the LTIB to perform a more in-depth analysis of immunologic monitoring of immune responses in the pre-clinical animal models, and also assess the phenotypic changes induced in carcinoma cell lines following exposures to various experimental treatments. The LTIB have demonstrated that changes in the phenotype of carcinoma cells can alter their antigenic/immunogenic potential, making them more susceptible to recognition and elimination by immune cells.</p>
<p>The following product features/salient characteristics are required for this requirement:</p>
<p>&bull; The laser must be compatible with the Attune NxT flow cytometer<br />&bull; Flat-top lasers which allow for very stable optical alignment <br />&bull; Fixed laser alignment<br />&bull; Six fluorescent detectors<br />&bull; Six fluorescent filters (450/50, 525/50, 610/20, 660/20, 710/50, 780/60) <br />&bull; Violet laser (405 nm wavelength) <br />&bull; 12 month warranty<br /><strong>Acceptance of trade-in of an oder version of the ATTune Flow cytometer (serial number: 9AAFC03670512) is required</strong></p>
