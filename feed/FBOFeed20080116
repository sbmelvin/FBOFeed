This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the acquisition of Dell PowerEdge 2900 Server.  The use of a brand name description is essential to the Governmentýs requirements and the Bureau of Consular Affairsý systems environment and visa generation requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another manufacturer or company. CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 2900 server equipped with more recent and powerful dual-core Intel Xeon 5150 processors for their superior performance and lower power consumption as the only server that can successfully function as a primary Oracle server (POS) for Consular Affairs overseas systems.  The PowerEdge 2900 server is the ninth generation PowerEdge server manufactured by Dell. The server is equipped with Intel Xeon 5100 series processors, which can help lower power consumption and can deliver up to a 152 percent increase in performance over the previous generation dual-socket Dell PowerEdge servers. The server uses dual core processor technology, combining two processing units into a single processor chip. This technology increases performance and efficient use of power, especially when running several applications on a single server.  Consular Affairs modernized applications rely on the availability and operability of a POS installed at every post where the applications are used.   The POS must function as a primary server, a standby, an external drive and a backup.  This is considered a critical piece of equipment. For support purposes, we must standardize on one configuration.  The Dell 2900 meets all requirements. CA/CST has identified the Dell PowerEdge 840 server equipped with dual core processor technology (configurable to quad core), as the only server that can successfully function as a secondary Oracle server (SOS) for Consular Affairs overseas systems. In summation, CA/CST believes that the Departmentýs best interests will be served if the Dell PowerEdge 2900 and Dell PowerEdge 840 is procured at this time.  No other server fully meets the Departmentýs requirements.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractorýs unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departmentýs requirements.<BR><BR>

<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), National Highway Institute (NHI) plans to award multiple 5-year indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts for the development, revision, updating, and presentation nationwide of training in the broad areas of Traffic Operations and Design, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Freight Transportation Logistics. All work will be identified in task order RFPs issued to those holding one of these base ID/IQ contracts.
  
Current NHI course offering in the areas covered may be found on the NHI web site at www.nhi.fhwa.dot.gov.  Additional courses or web-based offerings will be added as needs are defined.

The NHI is the technical training arm of the FHWA, and as such plays a vital role in the FHWA?s overall effort to provide training in new and evolving highway related technologies. The target audience for these courses is very broad, and includes Federal, state and local highway and transportation agencies located within the United States, Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP) Centers, associations, consulting firms, private industry, universities and other national and international entities engaged in highway work of interest to the United States.

In order for the NHI to best accomplish its training mission, it is necessary to accurately determine the needs of the target audience, and then develop and deliver a variety of training packages that will most effectively and efficiently present the intended messages.

The NHI has been performing this role primarily by delivering traditional, instructor-lead, classroom training on a broad range of topics since Congress established it in 1970. However, the electronic era is rapidly opening new avenues for cost savings, complying with divergent schedules, and training larger audiences in shorter periods of time. These avenues need to be explored, and enhancements to the current approaches implemented. 

In addition to a thorough knowledge of instructional systems design (ISD) and adult learning principals, subject matter expertise will be required in Traffic Operations and Design, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and Freight Transportation Logistics, including hands on experience in the development and delivery of training in these areas.

Training delivery methods may include traditional classroom instruction, as well as distance learning formats including asynchronous web-based training, synchronous web conference training, and blended approaches of these methodologies. It is estimated that web-based training will make up 30 -50 % of the work during the next 5 years.  Task Orders may also include other functions relating to training development and delivery such as needs assessment, marketing, electronic formatting for Section 508 compliance, translation of course materials into other languages, and conversion of traditional classroom instruction into distance learning formats.  Limited research necessary for development of technical reference manuals may be included. 

Unless specifically stated otherwise in the base contract or its subsequent task orders, the contractor shall furnish all facilities, materials, and personnel to perform services necessary to complete each Task Order issued. 

All qualified, responsible sources are encouraged to submit an offer. The Government intends to award multiple contracts on the basis of best value after full and open competition. The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) Web site that lists all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact -Joel Taylor, Contracting Officer, 617-494-2670
<DESC>This synopsis is a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) as contemplated in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102 and FAR 35.016.  A formal Request for Proposals (RFP), or other solicitation will not be issued.  BACKGROUND: Working across several agencies, including the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA), and the U.S. DOT, RITA, John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (Volpe Center), the Federal Government has developed a broad US aviation system upgrade plan called NEXTGEN to accommodate an expected tripling of US air traffic by the year 2025.  Avoiding serious, imminent, and irreversible threats to US aviation, including prohibitive air travel congestion and increased environmental damage, particularly to air quality, depend on the success of NEXTGEN. NEXTGEN seeks to improve aviation industry efficiency from the engine to the cockpit to overall air traffic management. Looking forward, the FAA?s Office of Environment and Energy (AEE) has determined that two main research initiatives under its purview will contribute dramatically to the success of NEXTGEN:  1. improvements in aviation fuel-burn modeling, and 2. alternative aviation fuel technology development.  The core mission of both these research initiatives is the mitigation of the impacts of burning aviation fossil fuels in the atmosphere and in the vicinity of airports.  The Volpe Center has been very active in supporting these research initiatives.  While FAA/AEE efforts to drive the first research initiative, fuel-burn modeling improvements, have mostly focused on the incentive method of Subject-Specific White Papers (SSWP) and science meetings to get results to date, NEXTGEN project managers at FAA/AEE and the Volpe Center are not certain this is the most practical way to pursue the second research initiative and drive the development of alternative aviation fuel technology.   OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to determine with confidence the best option for incentivizing the development of alternative aviation fuel technology and describe in a Research Roadmap how these options can be implemented in coordination with NEXTGEN efforts, ultimately mitigating the impacts of burning aviation fossil fuels in the atmosphere and in the vicinity of airports.  An option which provides incentive for the development of a non-fossil alternative aviation fuel must be presented in a detailed investigation of the option, culminating in a Research Roadmap that brings the best minds in the aviation and science communities together to solve this technical problem and how to speed up, to the greatest extent possible, the process of finding a viable technology that will provide a non-fossil alternative aviation fuel.  The Volpe Center invites interested parties to submit a proposal presenting a research outline for a Research Roadmap for consideration in response to this BAA.  Research projects may vary in size and scope, but should have a tentative budget target of $25,000 to $500,000 and must be completed within 14 months.  The NAICS code is 541712 with a size standard of 1,500 employees.  In the investigation of options to drive the development of an alternative aviation fuel technology, all responses to this BAA must provide an outline presenting how the offeror will approach considering one and only one of the following THREE OPTIONS: (1) the proven method of SSWPs, (2) the less proven method of the technology prize, or (3) any other additional options the offeror determines should be considered.  SSWP OPTION (1) - To address high-altitude fuel-burn modeling and other important technical problems in an efficient and timely manner, the US and Europe have utilized the method of calling for SSWPs to generate interest in a specific technical area and bring teams of experts together to consider solutions.  By this method, spanning a few months, the SSWP writers are recruited from as large a pool of experts as possible in the technical area being addressed, draft papers are written according to a specific set of topics, papers are distributed, a science meeting is called to consider final papers, and the best plan for resolving the problem is identified.  Within a few years of the first call for SSWPs, results may be received.  The contractor shall examine the SSWP method of driving technical solutions as it may or may not apply to the development of alternative aviation fuel technology.  The Volpe Center can provide a listing of members of the FAA/AEE?s Commercial Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative (CAAFI) for the contractor to utilize in its examination of the merits of the SSWP method in the development of alternative aviation fuel technology upon award, but this option can be addressed without this list if the offeror desires.  CAAFI membership is composed of aviation experts and scientists from the US and other governments, academia, aircraft manufacturers, airlines, the energy industry, and environmental advocates, among others.  The contractor may also utilize any other expert resources or research methods at its disposal in its examination of the feasibility of the SSWP method.  In this examination, the contractor must consider, but not be limited to considering, the following merits and key concerns of the SSWP method in driving the development of alternative aviation fuel technology: 1) Likelihood to incentivize interest- Describe the reach of the SSWP method to the broadest possible segments of the aviation and scientific communities.  Consider if this method will gain the interest of other Government agencies, academia, aircraft manufacturers, aviation fuel manufacturers, and the public.  Consideration of this method?s reach must address whether the SSWP method will be successful inside the US and Europe (where it has already proven a successful method in resolving other technical problems) and outside the US and Europe (where it has not been used as extensively in the past).  SSWP method will reach those best qualified to respond, and Call for Papers will be posted on the Government?s www.fedbizopps.gov website and published in research journals.  2) What are the pros and cons- State the positives and negatives of the SSWP method as it would apply to the development of alternative aviation fuel technology.  3) Provide estimated financial requirements to make this method successful, e.g. Budget.  Identify possible sources of funding for the SSWP method.  Identify if non-government parties are willing to contribute funds in a partnership focusing on alternative aviation fuel technology development. Describe alternative funding sources.  4) Provide an estimated calendar date by which results can be expected, e.g., when could alternative aviation fuel be available for use in commercial aircraft?  5) Discuss the likelihood of success for driving the development of alternative aviation fuel technology.  The results of this examination of the SSWP method shall be compiled and presented in the Research Roadmap.  PRIZE INCENTIVE OPTION (2)- In recent years, large-scope technological breakthroughs have been achieved via prize competitions focused on a specific technological goal, most notably in the area of space travel.  This recent success has demonstrated that a competition with a large prize and a well-articulated set of rules will produce a winning solution.  This open-contest format offers opportunities to generate huge technological breakthroughs by attracting diverse competitors and rewarding real outcomes.  This format defines the problem, not the path to the solution, and encourages innovation.  It also captures the Public?s imagination and accelerates the pace of change.  Experience has shown that the resulting advances in human behavior, industry transformation, and changes in public perception far exceed the value of the purse. The contractor shall examine the technology prize method of driving technical solutions as it may or may not apply to the development of alternative aviation fuel technology.  Again, the contractor may utilize the Volpe Center?s connections to CAAFI members in its examination of the merits of the prize method in the development of alternative aviation fuel technology, or the contractor may utilize any other expert resources or research methods at its disposal in its examination of the feasibility of the prize method.  In this examination, the contractor shall consider the following merits and key concerns of the prize method in driving the development of alternative aviation fuel technology: 1) Likelihood to incentivize interest- Describe the reach of the technology prize method to the broadest possible segments of the aviation and scientific communities.  Consider if this method will gain the interest of other Government agencies, academia, aircraft manufacturers, aviation fuel manufacturers, and the public.  Consideration of this method?s reach must address whether the prize method will be successful inside the US and Europe, where it is still a new method of driving technology development, and outside the US and Europe, where it remains perhaps an entirely unknown method of generating interest in the solution of a difficult technical problem.  Identify how the technology prize method will reach those best qualified to respond.  Describe the technology prize PR approach. 2) What are the pros and cons- State the positives and negatives of the prize method as it would apply to the development of alternative aviation fuel technology.  3) Provide estimated financial requirements to make this method successful, e.g. Budget. Identify and describe all possible sources of funding for the technology prize method.  Consider the likelihood that the Government would fund a prize contest and as well as alternative funding sources.  4) Provide an estimated calendar date by which results can be expected, e.g., when could alternative aviation fuel be available for use in commercial aircraft?  5) Discuss the likelihood of success for driving the development of alternative aviation fuel technology.  The results of this examination of the prize method shall be compiled and presented in the Research Roadmap. ADDITIONAL ALTERNATIVE OPTION (3)- The contractor shall examine additional methods of incentivizing the development of alternative aviation fuel technology.  Again, the contractor may utilize the Volpe Center?s connections to CAAFI members in its examination of the merits of these additional methods in the development of alternative aviation fuel technology, or the contractor may utilize any other expert resources or research methods at its disposal in its examination of the feasibility of these additional methods.  As with the SSWP and technology prize methods, in this examination of additional methods, the contractor shall consider for each additional method the following merits and key concerns in driving the development of alternative aviation fuel technology: 1) Likelihood to incentivize interest describe the reach of each method to the broadest possible segments of the aviation and scientific communities.  Consider if each method will gain the interest of other Government agencies, academia, aircraft manufacturers, aviation fuel manufacturers, and the public.  Consideration of each method?s reach must address whether the prize method will be successful inside and outside the US and Europe and the outreach logistics behind this method. 2) What are the pros and cons- State the positives and negatives of the method as it would apply to the development of alternative aviation fuel technology. 3) Provide estimated financial requirements to make this method successful, e.g. Budget.  Identify possible sources of funding for the method.  4) Provide an estimated calendar date by which results can be expected, e.g., when could alternative aviation fuel be available for use in commercial aircraft? 5) Discuss the likelihood of success for driving the development of alternative aviation fuel technology.  6) Identify the advantages, if any, to the Government taking no incentive action in this area of alternative aviation fuel technology development.  Identify, if any, market forces or other types of productive, stable efforts already in place that are leading to rapid advances in alternative aviation fuel technology development.  If there are market forces already in place leading to rapid advances in this technical area, describe any non-incentive methods by which the Government can assist these efforts.  The results of this examination of additional incentive methods shall be compiled and presented in the Research Roadmap.  Once either the SSWP method, technology prize method, or alternative incentive methods are researched to the fullest extent possible according to the key concerns posed in the respective task, the results shall be presented in a Research Roadmap (report) to be delivered to the Volpe Center.  The audience of this Roadmap will be the NEXTGEN project managers at FAA/AEE and the Volpe Center.  The Roadmap structure shall consist of the following sections:  1. An introduction on incentive methods in general, including discussion of past success with either the SSWP, technical prize, or an alternative method.  2. A section addressing the contractor research on the SSWP incentive method (if selected), including a treatment of all key concerns posed.  The contractor shall also discuss how this incentive method could be implemented in coordination with the NEXTGEN efforts.  3. A section addressing the contractor research on the technical prize incentive method (if selected), including a treatment of all key questions posed.  The contractor shall also discuss how this incentive method could be implemented in coordination with the NEXTGEN efforts.  4. A section addressing the contractor research on additional incentive methods (if selected), including for each a treatment of all key concerns posed and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of the Government taking no incentive action. The contractor shall also discuss how each incentive method could be implemented in coordination with the NEXTGEN efforts.    A draft of the Roadmap shall be delivered in electronic format (MS Word) to the Contracting Officer?s Technical Representative (COTR).  The contractor may be required to address Government comments on the draft Roadmap and incorporate changes into a final version, which shall be delivered in both electronic format (MS Word) and hardcopy to the COTR, Clay Reherman (3 hardcopies).  The Research Roadmap development for this project is estimated to not exceed 14 months.   After the delivered Roadmap has been reviewed, an incentive method may be chosen by the Government.  Incentive opportunities are likely to best occur over a 3- to 8-year timeframe such Government review.  CALL FOR PROPOSALS: This BAA is open to all domestic and foreign researchers.

The Air Force Research Laboratory, Rome Research Site, Information Directorate, (AFRL Rome) has a requirement for research and development in the area of Information Fusion and Understanding (IFU).  IFU is defined in the broadest sense as consisting of combining information to estimate or predict that state of some aspect of the universe.  The IFU process is further characterized by a continuous refinement of estimates and assessments, and by the evaluation of the need for additional sources, the effective management or modification of the process itself, to achieve improved results.  This effort supports modern military and homeland security operations by developing revolutionary decision-aiding capabilities to capture, manage, exploit, reason, and combine/fuse critical time sensitive information from a variety of sources.

The scope of this effort consists of performing multiple Research and Development (R&D) activities necessary to sustain a continuous process that provides world-wide situational awareness to enable decision superiority. This innovative technology will be applied to assemble actionable information from multiple data sources in order to establish and maintain battlespace situational awareness and understanding.  This includes an understanding of adversarial capabilities and intent and the ability to locate, identify, track, and observe/monitor all friendly, enemy, non-friendly, and nonaligned forces/actors anywhere/anytime in near real-time. 

The objective of this performance based services contract is to perform research, development, evaluation, integration, testing, demonstration, fielding, training, and operations and maintenance of innovative technologies and concepts to enable a continuous assessment of global conditions and events. 

Specifically this effort will investigate technological approaches to help achieve a heightened state of shared situational awareness, understanding and knowledge among all elements of a Joint force, in conjunction with Allied and coalition partners.  The goal is to employ new innovative technology concepts to help achieve situational dominance and dramatically increase survivability, lethality, speed, timeliness, and responsiveness.  Innovative fusion technologies and capabilities will be developed and delivered using multiple strategic, tactical and intelligence sources to identify and overcome critical weaknesses, and enable the warfighter to proactively anticipate, find, fix, track, target, engage, and assess any target, any where, at any time.  New approaches, techniques, and the development of software tools will be accomplished to provide adaptive multi-platform, multi-level, multi-intelligence reasoning and fusion systems to support the need of today's warfighter.

Anticipated deliverables include final technical reports, experimental software, hardware, technical documentation and training of innovative technologies.

An Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ)-CPFF/Completion type contract with a period performance of 60 months is anticipated.  Multiple Awards are anticipated (estimate appropriately 3 awards).  The maximum contemplated ordering amount is anticipated to be approximately $49,900,000.00 for all contracts combined. 

The prime Contractor and/or system integrators for this contract must have an approximate number of key personnel (approximately 20) having access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) or be clearable (Final US Top Secret Clearance without waiver and a Special Background investigation either on record or in process) that will be available for assignment to this effort immediately upon contract award (total for the prime and all subcontractors).

The Government aircraft are assigned on a permanent and temporary basis to P-3 Operations Centers located at military air bases, civilian air facilities and alternate sites in the United States and foreign locations. The aviation program also provides air support to other government and law enforcement agencies upon request.

The solicitation for this acquisition should be available on or about June 29, 2007.  Please do not contact CBP in reference to acquisition before this date.

<DESC>Pre-Solicitation Notice: Newborn Screening Translational Research Network Coordinating Center Description

Contracting Office Address

Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Blvd., Suite 7A07, MSC 7510, Bethesda, MD, 20892-7510, UNITED STATES

Description

THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT,NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Office of Acquisitions, The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) intends to negotiate a sole source contract, to have the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) develop and maintain a Coordinating Center that will establish the research infrastructure for a Newborn Screening Translational Research Network (NBSTRN).

Newborn screening is currently used to identify afflicted infants prior to presentation of clinical symptoms of disease.  It is the most common form of population-based genetic testing; screening 4 million newborn infants annually in the United States.  Recently there has been a rapid expansion of the number of conditions included in State newborn screening panels however, evidenced-based research to support the inclusion of these candidate conditions is lacking.  Specifically, there is a need to understand the natural history of these candidate conditions, explore technological capabilities of screening assays and develop therapeutic interventions for these conditions.

ACMG?s activities include the development of laboratory and practice standards and guidelines, advocating best quality genetic services in healthcare and in public health, and promoting the development of methods to diagnose, treat, and prevent genetic disease.  In many cases, these standards and guidelines are the intellectual property of ACMG and/or its members. The creation of equivalent standards and guidelines by another contractor would result in an unduly expensive and time-consuming activity, contrary to the public interest.  ACMG has extensive experience working with private healthcare and public health communities, other professional organizations, and stakeholder groups to incorporate information relevant to the evaluation of conditions under consideration for incorporation into Newborn Screening programs in the various states.  Thereby, ACMG has established a framework for identifying critical research needs, prioritizing these topics, and recommending a comprehensive research agenda.  The award of the National Coordinating Center to another organization would delay the implementation of this critical research initiative. ACMG has an established unique working relationship with all the States and all the Regional Collaborative Groups permitting that would facilitate access to Newborn Screening biospecimens and patients.  The award of the Coordinating Center to ACMG avoids the development of expensive duplicative programs needed for a national research infrastructure with sufficient access to biospecimens and patients essential to the research enterprise.  The additional cost for another contractor is estimated to be an additional $2 million and would delay implementation of critically-needed research by an additional 2 years.  

AUTHORITY:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1(b)(1), and HHSRA 306.302-1.  ACMG possesses unique capabilities, and is the only source, which satisfies NICHDs requirements.  If, however, there are sources who feel that they are able to perform the requirement, they must respond by submitting information required in Number Note 22 within 45 days of publication of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The capability statement will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Overnight deliveries should be mailed to National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Contracts Management Branch, 6100 Executive Boulevard, Suite 7A07, Bethesda, Maryland 20852.  No collect calls or facsimile transmissions will be accepted.

<SOLNBR>NSLSIIEOI
<RESPDATE>012508

<CONTACT>David Paveglio, Contracts Administrator, Phone 631-344-8461, Fax 631-344-5499, Email dpavegli@bnl.gov
<DESC>Brookhaven Science Associates, LLC (BSA) is seeking an expression of interest from General Contractors in relation to the construction of the conventional facilities for the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II), which is to be located at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), Upton, NY 11973.

The NSLS-II will be an advanced, highly optimized third generation medium energy storage ring.  The X-ray brightness and flux of NSLS-II will be world leading, exceeding that of any other currently existing or under construction.  It will be 10,000 times brighter than the present NSLS.  NSLS-II will meet the nation?s need for a high brightness, medium energy X-ray source. It will enable structural studies of the smallest crystals in structural biology and provide a wide range high resolution probes for Nanoscience.

The conventional facilities required for the NSLS-II will include a 900 foot diameter Ring Building encompassing approximately 400,000 square feet on a 40 acre site.  The Ring Building will serve as the centerpiece of NSLS-II and will house the operations center, offices for the visiting user community, laboratory space, the main accelerator ring, the experimental beamlines, experimental floor area, and supporting facilities.  

The proposed construction type for each building will be reinforced slab on grade with perimeter footing, structural steel frame with composite reinforced concrete slab on metal deck for upper floors, and insulated metal panel exterior.  Roofing may be a combination of standing seam metal roof, built-up bitumin, or membrane roof systems.  

Although the building design will generally involve standard commercial design and construction techniques, there are some additional considerations due to the specific requirements of the accelerator, experimental beamlines and types of research that will take place in laboratory spaces.  Placement of the floor slab will involve an estimated 35,000 cubic yards of concrete with special consideration given to minimization of differential settlement to assure alignment integrity of the installed accelerator and beamlines.  The NSLS-II project building is designed to minimize sources of vibration and transmission of vibration that would impact beam stability in the accelerator and experimental beamline areas and laboratory spaces. There are specific temperature stability requirements in the accelerator, experimental beamline, and certain laboratory spaces that will require HVAC system and control design that exceeds standard commercial practices.

The estimated value of conventional construction ranges between $160,000,000 and $200,000,000.  A rendering of NSLS-II along with a tentative site plan and section have been provided for your information. Construction of the NSLS-II will commence in the spring of 2009 and will complete in summer 2013.  The procurement method, envisioned at this time, for the project will be a Request for Proposal, to be evaluated based upon past performance and other technical factors.

Questions concerning this project should be directed to David J. Paveglio as provide for below.

Sponsorship will allow EPA access to key national stakeholders in the Faster Freight - Cleaner Air dialog, participation by EPA staff on working group teams for assistance in development of the conference agenda, speaker  selection, session topics, event logistics, and other input and guidance related to planning the event.  Sponsorship will also allow EPA to have exhibit space with priority location to maximize visibility and attendee foot traffic for display of work accomplished in relation to the conference.    Sponsorship will also allow EPA access to site visits, tours, demonstrations, and participation in the Faster Freight - Cleaner Air Conference marketing, public awareness, communications, and education outreach programs and products.

<DESC>NOTE: this announcement replaces the SSA Direct Accountability/Mail Metering Equipment and Services presolicitation notice (Reference Number 0814-08-1451) posted October 11, 2007.  The Social Security Administration (SSA) has a requirement for ongoing maintenance, rate change coverage, and postage meter leases for all Pitney Bowes (PB) mail metering systems currently owned or leased by SSA nationwide. The United States Postal Service's (USPS) final rule issued on November 27, 1992 called for all federal agencies, including SSA, to establish a system of direct accountability (DA) of the Agency's actual postage expenditures. SSA's primary method of DA has been the metering of all outgoing mail at all Agency mail sites nationwide. SSA intends to negotiate and award a contract for the agency's ongoing DA services and equipment with PITNEY BOWES CORPORATION, 7630 Little River Turnpike, 8th Floor; Annandale, VA 22003-2610 This will be a follow-on contract to contract 600-03-60046 awarded to Pitney Bowes January 30, 2003. Requirements include: MAINTENANCE: The contractor will maintain all equipment, will make one preventative maintenance visit per year to each mail site, will provide on site response within 4 working hours, restore equipment to full operation within 8 working hours or provide replacement equipment, and guarantee replacement parts for the systems will be available for the term of the contract. RATE CHANGE INSURANCE: The contractor will provide rate change coverage for all USPS rate changes, provide materials necessary to reprogram the equipment with either a new chip/cartridge, new software or online direct conversion. METER RENTALS: Provide for renewal of all meters currently leased and provide new and/or replacement meters with remote setting capability. If during the contract period the USPS requires SSA to switch to commercial postage meters, the contractor will replace existing meters with commercial meters at no charge to the government. DOCUMENTS, REPORTS AND COMMUNICATION WITH CONTRACTOR: The contractor will be responsible for delivering the following: Monthly Reports of Postage Activity, Service History and Equipment Inventory. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: The period of performance under this contract will be from July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2013, or a similar 5 year period. SSA will not issue a solicitation.  SSA will not respond to requests for solicitation copies and will not pay for information received in response to this announcement.  Responses must provide sufficient information for SSA to determine that a firm other than Pitney Bowes can provide the supplies and services as described above.  If SSA does not receive an acceptable response to this announcement within 15 days of its publication, it will proceed as stated herein. See Numbered Note #22, substituting (per FAR 5.203(a) and 12.204(b)) a response time of 15 days for this acquisition of a commercial item for the forty-five day response time appearing in the note. Respondents should refer to Direct Accountability/Mail Metering Equipment Maintenance and Services.

This contract is for the purpose of restoring irrigation water to the Hanksville Irrigation Company.  A flood event in October 2006 washed out the existing irrigation dam in the Fremont River leaving the water users without means of diverting water to approximately 800 acres of irrigated fields.  The people of Hanksville had no irrigation water last year.  If they don?t have water this year, they will go out of business.  

The items of work required include the construction of a new concrete diversion dam in the corridor of the Fremont River approximately 2 miles upstream of the community of Hanksville.  Additional components of the diversion structure and delivery system include a rock raceway for fish passage at the diversion structure, a concrete sediment sluicing structure, approximately 9,000 linear feet of 30 inch HDPE irrigation pipeline, and a new concrete water control structure at the downstream end of the pipeline for delivering water to the existing irrigation ditches.  The water control structure will also incorporate a suspended pipe bridge over the river providing water to a portion of the irrigated farmland opposite the water control structure.

As the diversion structure is in the river itself and portions of the irrigation pipeline are at the edge of the active river corridor, rock armament totaling about 31,000 cubic yards to protect the new structures will be required in order to sustain the life span of the proposed engineering practices.

As significantly lesser portion of this acquisition is to restore the Caineville Diversion, approximately 15.20 miles further upstream.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. army Corps of Engineers, New York District intends to issue a sole source modification to an existing contract through a Justification and Approval document to perform additional maintenance dredging with placement of the material dredged al ong the shoreline at Gilgo Beach. The sole source modification to the existing contract, W912DS-07-C-0027, with Weeks Marine Inc., is being issued to rehabilitate highly eroded beach areas at Gilgo Beach which provide protection to Ocean Parkway and have r eceived emergency funding. These two highly eroded areas along Gilgo Beach which requires a total of about 100,000 cubic yards of sand can be identified as survey stations 70 +00 to 90+33 and 110+33 to 120+33. The use of the sole source modification to the  existing contract is based on the availability of the on-site contractor to perform this beach erosion control work in a timely manner. The eroded dune line areas are just south of Ocean Parkway, which serves as a Coastal Hurricane/Emergency Evacuation ro ute. Therefore, it is extremely important that the eroded areas be provided with a level of shore protection promptly, in order to prevent an increase in erosion in areas that could lead to a potential impact to the critical infrastructure. A Justification  and Approval document is being prepared to support the Government position that this is the most efficient method of performing the work in a timely fashion.<BR>

<DESC>Reference the synopsis from the Vicksburg District dated October 25, 2007, announcing an intent to modify Contract No. DACW38-01-D-0005 with the URS Group, Inc.  In that notice it was announced that the USACE Vicksburg District intended to modify its  existing contract with the URS Group, Inc. to increase the contract value by $10 million on a SOLE SOURCE BASIS under the authority provided by 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1).  However, since that announcement it has been determined that it is in the best interes t of the Government to award a new SOLE SOURCE contract to URS Group, Inc. in lieu of modifying their existing contract for the same work. This announcement is NOT a new requirement; the basis for the sole source is the same as stated in the previous annou ncement referenced above. The SOLE SOURCE contract will be a continuation of the design effort from URS current contract. The current contract is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract for the Preparation of Design Report and Plans and  Specifications (P&S) for the Construction of Houma Navigation Lock, Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico Hurricane Protection Project, Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana, New Orleans and Vicksburg Districts. Currently the contract has a value of $10 million with a ba se year and six option periods. The project design and P&S were near 50% completion when Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana. As a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita the design flow line that governs the entire structural design of this project  was significantly increased, requiring a portion of the design already complete to be substantially redesigned in order to regain the 50% complete status. The Vicksburg District has determined that a new contract with URS Group, Inc. is the only reasonabl e means available to the Government to ensure mission requirements for completing the design from an economical and technical standpoint. Selection of a new firm to complete the design at this stage would result in delays that are unacceptable to local cos t-sharing sponsors and additional costs associated with verification of completed work before assuming liability for the total design. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of satisfying Vicksburg Distric ts requirements may contact Mr. Randy Brown at 601 631-7249 for additional information. A determination not to complete the requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>This is an updated market survey and sources sought synopsis to identify Small Business concerns (including 8(a) Small Disadvantaged; Service-disabled Veteran Owned; Woman-Owned; and HUBZone Business firms with expertise in providing Automated Point of Care Technology such as bar-code enabled or other commercially available automated solutions supporting numerous aspects of hospital- based patient care.  Industry responses are encouraged from all interested sources and will aid in the understanding and development of the Government?s functional and technical requirements by identifying capabilities and functionality of commercially available systems.  In addition, responses will be utilized to aid in our determination for set-aside possibilities.  The health care industry has identified human factors as a key element in the misidentification of patients, materials or medications, delivery of the wrong service to the wrong patient, and inefficient tracking of patients and materials in the hospital setting.  The Government believes that well designed and successfully implemented automated systems can provide significant improvements in patient safety by eliminating manual steps that are error prone due to human factors.  The Government?s objective is to identify sources capable of providing Automated Point of Care Technology system that helps to ensure that critical patient care services are delivered with the greatest possible accuracy, efficiency and safety.  The Automated Point of Care Technology should have the ability to address the following three broad goals which will be applied to hospital-wide processes involved in specimen collection; blood administration; medication administration; nursing workflow; and tracking processes.  1.  Prevent misidentification errors through accurate identification of patients; and accurate identification of medications; blood products; medical records; lab specimens; medical equipment; medical supplies; and staff.  2.  Facilitate automation of workflow processes and tracking systems by Tracking of patient movement throughout the hospital; Tracking of paper medical record charts location in the hospital; Documentation of medical supplies and equipment used in the course of patient care; Tracking of medical equipment location in the hospital; and Electronically capturing data from general patient monitoring equipment such as vital sign monitors and infusion pumps.  3.  Facilitate real-time electronic verification and clinical documentation steps through Verification of correct product and or procedures at point of care as per medical order (medications, blood products, specimen collection, diagnostic procedures, therapeutic procedures, ancillary services); and Verification of correct medical record at the time of clinical documentation. The NIH Clinical Center?s requirement is for the following:  A wireless Barcode Enabled Point of Care System that is compatible with the networking and technology capabilities available in the NIH Clinical Center.  Wireless may prove incompatible with telemetry and shielding and strong magnetic fields in certain locations of the Clinical Center. If such a situation exists a wired system will be used in these locations. Therefore, the system must possess a dual capability to support both wired and wireless systems; A complete turnkey on-site implementation and project management support.; Complete hardware, including system servers, hand held system with bar-code capabilities and label printing device and additional peripherals; System Configuration; Training; Implementation Services; Maintenance; and Upgrade Services.  
1.	The NIH Clinical Center intends to incorporate automated technology solutions at the point of care with existing clinical information systems for the following patient care processes:  Laboratory specimen collection ? accurate identification of the patient at the bedside, verification of current orders for specimen collection, verification of accurate specimen labeling, documentation of specimen collection; Blood administration ? accurate identification of the patient at the bedside, verification of current orders for blood administration, verification of correct blood product, documentation of blood administration process; Medications administration - accurate identification of the patient at the bedside, verification of current orders for medications, verification of correct medication and ?five rights?, documentation of medication administration; General nursing care - accurate identification of the patient at the point of care, verification of current orders for procedures and treatment, electronic capture of patient monitoring data such as vital signs; Patient and critical materials tracking ? electronic capture of current location for patient, paper medical records, mobile clinical equipment.  This is a SOURCES SOUGHT announcement only, and your response is not an offer.  All information submitted in response to this announcement is voluntary.  The Government will not pay for the information requested nor will it compensate any respondent for any cost incurred in the preparation or submission of industry responses.

<DESC>MODIFICATION: "ALL OFFERORS ATTENDING THE SITE VISIT MUST BE U.S. CITIZENS."      The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst intends to procure, via Government supplied drawing package, aircraft engine test systems for the purpose of intermediate level testing of turbo-shaft and turbo-prop aircraft engines in either indoor or outdoor environments. These systems will provide US Navy & Marine Corps intermediate maintenance level engine test capability for the H-60, AH-1, H-53, P3, C130, C2, and E2 aircraft families, and for the US Army: the CH-47, UH-60, and AH-64 aircraft. The engine test systems perform diagnostic troubleshooting along with the functional capability to analyze signals from the engine and fault isolate to the component level. The Navy owns the drawings and test software and will manage configuration.

The Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation system (SETI) and Turboprop Engine Test Instrumentation system (TPTI) interfaces with two major functional elements; the engine under test and the test system or facility. The SETI and TPTI will be operated worldwide at U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Air Stations. The basic system consists of the necessary hardware and software to acquire raw analog and digital engine data, perform signal conditioning and time averaging, perform specific engine performance calculations, and output the data results to a video display, printer and magnetic media. SETI / TPTI also controls the engine operation and ancillary test facility systems such as fuel, dynamometer, and engine lube cooling. Operator Control for this system is via a touch-screen personal computer based upon a Windows 2000 architecture. The single station control system serves more than one engine test program set (TPS). Only the TPS portion of the system will be unique for each engine test.

The major components of the SETI / TPTI  system will be manufactured / procured and installed by the prospective contractor into either a government supplied transportable instrumentation and control cab (ISO type) enclosure, or into a fixed test facility at a Navy aircraft maintenance facility. The major components of SETI / TPTI consist of a data acquisition cabinet, a terminal strip cabinet, the facility and test program set consoles for the operators (which contain the computers, monitors, and engine throttle controls), the electrical/mechanical junction boxes (external to the ISO cab) and the engine adapter assembly, which consists of the cabling and sensors for control and feedback from the engine.

The contractor will provide necessary systems engineering, materials, equipment, facilities, testing, technical, management, logistics, and manufacturing for the efforts which will be described in the Statement of Work (SOW). 

The required basic quantity is estimated at two (2) Pilot Production Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) Units, one (1) Pilot Production Test Program Set for the T700 GE Turboshaft Engine, one (1) Pilot Production Test Program Set for the T64 GE Turboshaft Engine, one (1) Pilot Production Turbo Prop Engine Test Instrumentation (TETI) Unit, one (1) Pilot Production Model T-33 Shaft Engine Test Instrumentation (SETI) Units for the US Army, and up to 48 Production Units. This procurement also includes technical data requirements.

After solicitation release, the government will provide an opportunity for interested offerors to visit a full-scale, mobile SETI engine test system at Naval Air Warfare Center, Patuxent River, MD. The dates for visits will be provided at solicitation release, and are being conducted in order to help offerors gain an understanding of the component interrelationships, and of the size and scope of this project. Visits will be by appointment only, and will be limited to one hour maximum. There is a limit of 4 persons maximum for each visit group. During the visit, equipment will be described and shown to all prospective companies individually, using the same generalized script. Any questions will be recorded and the answers provided to all offerors using the World Wide Web. All travel, labor, and other expenses incurred in the visit are the responsibility of the offeror. Offerors are not required to attend. 

The Government is anticipating an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Fixed Price type contract.  This procurement will be Full and Open.  The solicitation will be posted on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil.  Select DOING BUSINESS and then OPEN SOLICITATIONS.  Look for amendments on the web page. Hard copy of solicitations and amendments will NOT be mailed to contractors. The Government will NOT accept electronic offers. The solicitation will be posted on the web, on or about 1 February 2008.

<DESC>Gulfport, Mississippi, Armed Forces Retirement Home, New Construction, Industry Day.

On Wednesday, February 13, 2008, The United States General Services Administration (GSA) will conduct an Industry Day for prospective Small Business Subcontractors, for the construction phase of The Armed Forces Retirement Home, Gulfport, Mississippi.  The Industry Day, or Small Business Subcontracting Networking Session, will be conducted from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the TBD (Beau Rivage, Beach Drive, Biloxi, Mississippi).

The new Armed Forces Retirement Home project to be constructed in Gulfport, Mississippi will consist of four projects: 1) new construction of the Armed Forces Retirement Home (Main Building); 2) restore existing chapel; 3) demolition of the existing and new construction of the pedestrian bridge overpass; and 4) repair/restore or replace the existing swimming pool.

The design/build services contract for the Armed Forces Retirement Home (Main Building) was awarded to W. G. Yates Construction Company in the amount of $188, 883,476. In an effort to facilitate the Small Business Community participation in the construction of the main building project, Small Businesses are invited to network with W. G. Yates as they continue to enter into agreements with qualified subcontractors.  

The Main Building consists of: approximately 660,000 gross square feet to accommodate 584 residents plus staff; controlled parking for 400 vehicles; surface parking for 150 vehicles including boats and oversized vans and buses; new gate house; security fence; remote operated entrance; furniture fixture and equipment, demolition of existing structures, roadways, and walkways; complete landscaping of entire site, including walking paths, outdoor areas, and recreation areas.

The Chapel is approximately 6,500 SF one story.  An assessment is currently being prepared to determine the extent of the construction services.  Services for the restoration of the chapel will include select demolition, design and construction services for architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing and fire protection systems replacement.

The pedestrian bridge will include demolition, design and construction services for the bridge that will connect the campus across the access road and Beach Blvd. (Hwy 90) with the beach.

The swimming pool will include design and construction services to replace the existing swimming pool with a modified program from the original pool and located adjacent to the main building.

This Industry Day is intended to affirm GSA's recognition of the talent that exists in The Small Business Community and its commitment to opening a dialog between that community, GSA and the construction firms that have been selected for this project.  Yates, the design-build services firm selected for this project submitted a Subcontracting Plan prior to contract award demonstrating a commitment to awarding approximately $75 million dollars that were mutually agreed upon by the prospective awarded and the government within the following categories: Small Disadvantaged Businesses (including 8(a)-8%, Woman-Owned Small Businesses-5%, HubZone Businesses-3%, Small Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses-3%, Other Small Businesses-18%.


Prospective Small Business Subcontractors will be given an opportunity to network with the Yates, GSA and other firms and to showcase their special talents and abilities as qualified subcontractors.  Although it is anticipated that this Industry Day will assist Yates in identifying qualified subcontractors to meet the subcontracting goals listed above for this project, because GSA is not permitted by law to be a part to contractual relationships between potential Prime and Subcontractors, any contracts that may be entered into as a result of this Industry Day will be strictly private arrangements between the interested parties based on perceived ability and need.

Questions about this Industry Day should be directed to David Gibson, GSA?s Small Business Advocate, Telephone (404) 331-2366, E-Mail: DavidA.Gibson@GSA.GOV.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (Not a Notice of Solicitation) This is a Sources Sought Synopsis.  There is no solicitation available at  this time.  This Sources Sought Synopsis is published for Market Research  purposes only.  This market survey is conducted to identify potential  sources capable of meeting the requirements for providing Air Force SBIR  contractors with technical assistance in accordance with USC Title 15,  Sec. 638 Paragraph q, Discretionary Technical Assistance.  The primary  focus of this assistance is intended to be in the area of planning and  preparation for commercialization of technologies, products, or services  developed under Air Force SBIR contracts.  Technical assistance provided  under this effort is not intended to focus on solving specific technical  problems that arise in the course of technology development under a  particular SBIR contract.  A proposed draft Performance Work Statement  (PWS) is attached to provide respondents a better understanding of the  needs of the AF SBIR Program and the respondent?s potential ability to  meet the Government?s requirement. The Government envisions a one year award with two subsequent 12 month  renewal options.  In the first year, assistance efforts will be limited to  Phase I SBIR recipients only, in accordance with the tasks described in  the draft PWS, Sec. 1.1. The total value of the first year effort is  expected to be limited to not more than $2M.  In the second and third  year, support efforts are expected to expand to include assistance to  Phase II SBIR recipients.  Additional tasks are described in Sec. 1.2 of  the daft PWS.

<DESC>NASA Learning Technologies Request for Information: Development of a NASA-based Massively Multiplayer Online Learning Game Introduction The NASA Learning Technologies (LT) Project Office supports projects that deliver NASA relevant content through innovative applications of technologies to enhance education in the areas of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM).	Research and development in each of the STEM areas are at the core of the LT mission.  LT seeks to enhance formal and informal education in STEM fields with the goal of increasing the number of students in those fields of study. The LT is currently evaluating the development of a NASA-based massively multiplayer online educational game (MMO). Background Persistent immersive synthetic environments in the form of massive multiplayer online gaming and social virtual worlds, initially popularized as gaming and social settings, are now finding growing interest as education and training venues. There is increasing recognition that these synthetic environments can serve as powerful ?hands-on? tools for teaching a range of complex subjects, including STEM-based instruction. Virtual worlds with scientifically accurate simulations could permit learners to tinker with chemical reactions in living cells, practice operating and repairing expensive equipment, and experience microgravity ? making it easier to grasp complex concepts and quickly transfer this understanding to practical problems. MMOs help players develop and exercise a skill set closely matching the thinking, planning, learning, and technical skills increasingly in demand by employers today. These skills include strategic thinking, interpretative analysis, problem solving, plan formulation and execution, team-building and collaboration, and adaptation to rapid change. The power of games as educational tools is rapidly gaining recognition. NASA is in a position to develop an online game that functions as a persistent, synthetic environment supporting education as a laboratory, a massive visualization tool, and collaborative workspace while simultaneously drawing users into a challenging, game-play experience. Objective for Request for Information A NASA-based MMO built on a game engine that includes powerful physics capabilities could support accurate in-game experimentation and research. It should simulate real NASA engineering and science missions in a medium that is comfortable and familiar to the majority of students in the United States today. A NASA-based MMO could provide opportunities for students to investigate STEM career paths while participating in engaging game-play. Through a NASA-based MMO, students will gain insight into a wide range of exciting career opportunities and be encouraged to make educational choices that lead them into STEM fields of study and eventually the STEM careers needed to fulfill NASA?s Vision for Space Exploration. Learning Technologies is seeking input on how to accomplish those goals. Description of Information Requested The purpose of this RFI is to solicit information from organizations with proven immersive synthetic environments expertise who are interested in potentially forming a MMO platform development partnership with NASA. We are currently targeting releasing a Request for Proposal in March 2008. The NASA LT Project Office is requesting information to support the development of a NASA-based STEM educational MMO. A high quality synthetic gaming environment is a vital element of NASA?s educational cyberstructure. This new synthetic world would be a collaborative work and meeting space as well as a game space of a kind familiar to increasing numbers of American students. Games and challenges in the MMO would engage students in a way that is both familiar and comfortable for them. In turn, participation in the MMO would build increased student awareness of STEM fields and lead more students to pursue STEM courses of study. The MMO will foster career exploration opportunities in a much deeper way than reading alone would permit and at a fraction of the time and cost of an internship program. The RFI submitter is expected to address: 1. How a NASA-based educational MMO should be designed. 2. How a NASA-based educational MMO should support both formal and informal education efforts. 3. How a NASA-based educational MMO should connect to current and future NASA missions. 4. How NASA career opportunities exploration and significant STEM learning experiences would be incorporated into the design a NASA- based educational MMO. 5. How a NASA-based educational MMO game play would be engaging for all participants. Disclaimer It is not NASA?s intent to publicly disclose vendor proprietary information obtained during this solicitation. To the full extent that it is protected pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act and other laws and regulations, information identified by a respondent as "Proprietary or Confidential" will be kept confidential. It is emphasized that this RFI is for planning and information purposes only and is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contractual agreement, nor will the Government pay for information solicited. How to Respond ? Visit http://ipp.gsfc.nasa.gov/mmo   , then click on RFI submissions     o Submit by February 15, 2008 11:59 p.m. Eastern Standard Time ? Five (5) page limit, 12-point font size, 1 inch margins ? Authorized document formats include Adobe (.pdf), Microsoft Word (.doc), or Rich Text Format (.rtf).

<DESC>The United States Navy is researching the development of a ship Damage Control Simulator (DCS).  The DCS will be required to have a 20 year service life and be built to internationally recognized commercial and naval standards. The DCS should be designed using systems and equipment common to the Royal Navy of Oman (RNO) fleet, and supportable for the expected service life. 

The layout of the DCS should be (2) two decks in height and consist of a set of realistic ships compartments including a diesel generator space, mess deck, and galley. In linking these three main scenario compartments, various storerooms, pump rooms, passageways, the damage control section base, and ladders should be utilized. There should also be an air conditioned compartment for use as a damage control headquarters from which the command team can operate. Viewing areas are to be incorporated for instructors to accomplish assessments and to ensure safety during the conduct of training exercises. All compartments are to be outfitted with RNO markings and fixtures to ensure realistic and relevant training. 

Simulation should include flooding damage to a ship, and should provide essential damage control training for recruits through senior students. The maximum training capacity should be (24) students plus (5) instructors. Movement of the DCS should be simulated to a maximum of 20 degrees angle of roll on either side of the vertical plane. Both roll angle and pitch should be adjustable to simulate various stages of list or loll. Numerous damage points should be included to simulate all aspects of flooding damage from ship grounding to full battle damage scenarios. Simulation of this damage is intended to train students to work as a team from initial leak arresting (splinter damage), to advanced shoring techniques and damage repair (large hole / buckled hatch.) Pumped exercise smoke should be available in all compartments. Medical dummies should be used for first aid team training in casualty evacuation, and sound effects should be utilized to ensure realistic scenarios. The DCS should also have the ability to simulate lighting failure for darkened scenarios. Students are expected to perform under stressful, demanding, and realistic conditions safely completing the training with full confidence in the equipment and procedures. Students are to also be trained in undertaking damage control tasks in cold water as well as when the vessel is moving and rolling.  The DCS should incorporate safety features that allow for rapid clearance of a flooded or smoke filled compartment. 

The DCS should be able to withstand air temperatures of up to 50 degrees Celsius, relative humidity of up to 90%, and wind speed up to 50 knots. Air conditioning is required in the control room and in an area close to the unit for briefing. A shaded area is required for the storage of equipment such as damage control equipment, clothing and other items required by the students, as well as for student breaks.

Additional options for the DCS include a computer based trainer to provide training in equipment functionality, DCS layout techniques, and damage control techniques in the classroom prior to entering the simulator and conducting training exercises. 

Operational training is to be provided to safely conduct exercises in a ?train the trainer? format. Training should also be provided covering maintenance procedures, basic troubleshooting, and repair. 

Maintenance manuals and operational procedures including the details of all maintenance operations required during the service life of the DCS should be provided. In the absence of this level of detail, sufficient data on key systems should be made available for maintenance data development. All delivered documentation must be provided in both hard and electronic copies.

All major fitted equipment or any equipment requiring replacement of a specific make or model must have a stated intent from the manufacturer of spares support for at least 10 years. The DCS must also include a two year warranty commencing from site acceptance.

A milestone chart depicting approximate dates of completion and stages of installation, training and associated events to ascertain the time required to build the DCS, and make ready for training is required .

Businesses capable of performing this effort should submit the following information:

1.  Rough Order of Magnitude (ROM) price.

2.  Narrative identifying the scope of past and present (within the last 2 years) relevant experience on simular contracts.

3.  Description of capabilities to perform the subject effort, and alternative approaches to filling the subject requirement.

4.  Identify business type/size.

<DESC>The Department of Education is searching for qualified small businesses and small disadvantaged businesses, including 8(a) vendors, to perform a five-year NAEP Quality Assurance (QA) contract (FY2008 through 09/29/2012).  The Department is not seeking capability statements from large vendors.  Interested SB, SDB, including 8(a) vendors can call John Machen at 202-245-6167 or email john.machen@ed.gov.  Please submit your Capability Statements electronically by 12 noon, Eastern Standard Time, on Thursday, January 30, 2008.

The Purpose of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is:

The purpose of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is to provide a fair and accurate measurement of educational achievement in reading, mathematics, science and writing -- often referred to as the core assessments -- and other content areas including history, geography, civics, economics, foreign languages and the arts as funds are available. The assessment results are representative of the nation, regions, and where appropriate, states and select urban districts at grades 4, 8, and 12.  NAEP also reports on national long term trend assessments in reading and mathematics for students at ages 9, 13, and 17.

Purpose and Legislative Authority for National Assessment of Educational Progress

The National Assessment of Educational Progress Improvement Act, Part C of the Augustus F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvements Amendments of 1988 (Public Law 100-297), which is now part of U.S. Code (20 U.S.C. 9010 and 9011), legislatively defined the purpose of the NAEP "to improve the effectiveness of our nation's schools by making objective information about student performance in selected learning areas available to policymakers at the national, state and local levels. To enhance its utility, such information should be both representative and comparable, and should be maintained in a manner that ensures the privacy of individual students and their families."  The most important aspect of NAEP is its ability to report trends in student performance overtime. Therefore, NAEP must maintain the capacity to report results of each new assessment on the same metric as past assessments.

The National Assessment of Educational Progress Improvement Act, Part C of Public Law 100-297 (later 20 U.S.C. 9010 and 9011) restructured the National Assessment and authorized NAEP to report directly to the Commissioner of Education Statistics at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Among the major changes were: the establishment of a National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policy governing NAEP and provides NCES with advice on how to carry out the assessments, and the authorization of Trial State Assessments in 1990 and 1992.  Other provisions called for assessments of adult literacy, protection of the confidentiality of the assessment data, ongoing reviews of NAEP, and an independent evaluation of the Trial State Assessments.

Public Law 103-33 (now part of 20 U.S.C. 9010 and 9011) amended the National Assessment of Educational Progress Improvement Act in 1994 to authorize a trial state assessment in mathematics and reading. The Improving Americas? Schools Act, Title IV of Public Law 103-382 (now part of 20 U.S.C. 9010 and 9011), authorized state and national assessments under the NAEP program for an additional 3 years, and dropped the prohibition on providing school district results. 

The Amendment to the National Education Statistics Act of 1994 in the No Child Left Behind legislation of 2001 included the following provisions:

* Assessments in reading and mathematics at 4th and 8th grades every other year with 1 year off between assessments starting with a 2003 baseline assessment; and 12th grade reading and mathematics assessments administered at least every 4 years.

* States and school districts receiving Title I funds are to participate in the 4th and 8th grade reading and mathematics assessments.

* National samples are to include public and private schools.

* Parents of students selected for any NAEP sample are to be informed, "that their child may be excused from participation for any reason, is not required to finish any...assessment, and is not required to answer any test question."

* "Personal or family beliefs and attitudes" are not to be assessed and National Assessment Governing Board is to ensure that all NAEP questions are "secular, neutral, and non-ideological."

* Parents, members of the public, and state and local education officials, upon written request, are to be given access to all NAEP questions under secure conditions and may submit written complaints.

* NAEP long-term trend reading and mathematics assessments at ages 9, 13, and 17 are to be administered.

* Information by disability and limited-English proficiency in addition to race or ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status are to be reported wherever feasible.

Until this legislation is reauthorized, possibly in 2007, NAEP will continue to operate under these provisions.

Administration

The Commissioner of Education Statistics in NCES carries out the National Assessment, while the National Assessment Governing Board is responsible for establishing policies and guidelines for NAEP.

NCES implements NAEP through a team of contractors, termed the "NAEP Alliance."  While each Alliance Contractor implements a particular phase or phases of the assessment (described in more detail on the bidders page in the "NAEP Alliance Components" section), the Alliance must function as a team with a high degree of coordination and including some tasks that must be performed jointly.  In addition, the Quality Assurance Contractor must function well with the NAEP Alliance and any other Contractors that perform work on the NAEP project.

Purpose of This Contract

Since the first assessments administered in 1969, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has served as the central national measure of student achievement ever since (Jones, 1996).  Over the past four decades, the NAEP program has undergone several significant transformations.  Most recently, the No Child Left Behind Education Act of 2002 (NCLB) gave rise to many changes within the program.  This legislation requires states to implement rigorous school accountability systems and also requires states to participate in biennial NAEP assessments in reading and mathematics for grades 4 and 8.  The legislation also includes shifting the cost of state coordination and test administration to the federal government and increased security, public access, and review of NAEP?s instruments  (Public Law 100-297 and later 20 U.S.C. 9010 and 9011).  Over the past four years, the result of the NCLB legislation has been a dramatic increase in the role of NAEP as a national instrument for educational reform and the effort needed to ensure the quality of the NAEP program.  Thus, it is critical that all of NAEP's processes, operations, products, and publications be of the highest quality, and that continuous improvement be made.

To address the increased need for quality assurance, NCES included a contract for a NAEP Quality Assurance (NAEP-QA) project in its 2003 - 2007 cycle of contracts.  The NAEP-QA project developed a comprehensive and coordinated program of activities to ensure the overall quality of the NAEP program.  It was designed to provide independent checks and real-time corrective feedback for the various processes conducted by each of the other contracts related to the NAEP program.  The NAEP-QA project is extremely challenging because of the wide-ranging and complex activities it seeks to monitor, such as NAEP's intricate assessment design and operations, conducting real-time corrective action, and anticipating problems and recommending improved processes for reducing the risk of their occurrence.

As the NAEP program prepares for the 2008 - 2012 cycle of contracts, the need for a Quality Assurance Contractor is greatly needed.  The purpose of the Quality Assurance of NAEP Processes contract is to provide a formative evaluation of NAEP.  NCES is seeking a Contractor who will serve as partner to NCES by providing programmatic feedback for the continuous improvement and enhancement of the NAEP program.  The Quality Assurance Contractor will assist NCES in identifying any weaknesses or flaws in the critical path of NAEP and will make recommendations for strengthening NAEP processes.  The Contractor would be expected to build on valuable information gained from the NAEP-QA project over the last four years, which includes recommendations from a review of past problems, analyses of NAEP processes, various operational site visits, and many small-scale studies of specific NAEP processes.  Specifically, this request for proposals calls for a review of program methods and analyses to assist with programmatic strategic planning, analysis of NAEP processes, site visits of various NAEP operations and processes, study of NAEP operations and processes, and other general quality assurance activities.

This contract will partly fulfill legislative requirements (P.L. 107-279, Title 3, Section 303) that calls for a continuing review of NAEP.  However, it is not intended to address all of the issues identified in that section of the legislation. The Department of Education issued another contract for a summative evaluation of the NAEP program that serves as the primary source for the Secretary's report to Congress, the President of the United States, and the Nation.

NOTE: Because the Quality Assurance Contractor will provide support for NCES that includes reviewing work by NAEP Contractors, eventual winner of this contract may not currently hold any other NAEP-related contracts.

Installation Description

West Point is located on the west bank of the Hudson River, approximately 50 miles north of New York City and 15 miles south of Newburgh.  In addition to being a college campus with academic, social and athletic activities, West Point is a military installation and a National Historical Landmark, as well as a national tourist attraction with over 3 million tourists annually.

The Major Command is the United States Military Academy.  Today the Corps of Cadets numbers almost 4,000 men and women from every state in the Union as well as several foreign countries and U.S. territories.  

West Point is currently undergoing an extensive Revitalization Program that will greatly improve the quality of cadet life.  West Point gives the impression of being geographically isolated because of the river and mountains that must be crossed to reach communities and services other than those found in the Town of Highlands.
 
As the oldest continually occupied post in our country's history, West Point is home for approximately 1,400 military personnel.  Most military personnel are members of the Academy's staff and faculty and assigned to the 1st Battalion of the 1st Infantry. 

Additional installation information may be located at:  http://www.usma.edu/

Solicitations will be issued for timber fallers, tent/canopy, service truck/mechanics, GIS units, mobile laundry, refrigerated truck/trailer, and office/clerical support modules.

In order to receive an EERA for these categories of equipment/services, vendors must respond to the solicitations when they are issued.  Only one award nationally will be made for any piece of equipment r service within a category.  The EERAs that are issued will be for a period of three years.  There WILL NOT be another opportunity to sign up these types of equipment/services until the end of that three year period.  Standard specifications will be included in the solicitations to increase consistency.  The solicitations will only be available online and will not be mailed out hardcopy.  It is expected that solicitations will be issued on a geographic basis throughout the winter/fall months.  They will be available for free download at www.fedbizopps.gov.  To be considered for award, vendors must maintain a current registration in the Central Contractor's Registration System (http://www.ccr.gov).  This registration must be updated annually.  For additional information for your the Region Two Area, contact Dell McCann at 303-275-5164.

<SUBJECT>--US Army Engineering Support Center, Huntsville - Notice of Intent to Seek Approval from the ASA (ALT) Under FAR Part 6.302-1 to Increase Programmatic Contract Capacity Under the Military Munitions Response Program FY04 MATOC Pool
<DESC>This is not a notice of solicitation or request for proposal.<BR><BR>The US Army Engineering and Support Center, Huntsville intends to seek approval from the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology) under Federal Acquis ition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1  only one or a limited number of responsible sources will satisfy agency requirements, for up to an additional $700 million in programmatic contract capacity under the current Military Munitions Response Program Multip le Award Task Order Contracts (MATOCs) which are about to reach their programmatic contract capacity ceiling of $1.475 billion within the third option period of a 5-year contract (1-year base period with four 1-year option periods).  The MATOCs were issued  under NAICS code 562910  environmental remediation services.  The increase in $700 million will bring the existing programmatic contract capacity up to $2.175 billion total.  The original solicitation number for these ten awards was W912DY-04-R-0003; the  awards made were staggered between Feb 2004 and June 2004.  The Huntsville Center is currently working on the replacement contracts for these expiring contracts with the awards projected in April 2009  solicitation date is pending acquisition strategy ap proval.  This additional programmatic capacity requested will be utilized until the new awards have been made by the Huntsville Center at which time, all new Task Orders will be competed and awarded following Section 803 requirements under the replacement contracts as done currently.  The current ten contract numbers, award dates and contractors within this MATOC pool are <BR><BR>W912DY-04-D-0005 - 02/27/2004 - Parsons Infrastructure and Tech Group, Inc.  Pasadena, CA<BR>W912DY-04-D-0006 - 02/27/2004 - US A Environmental, Inc.  Oldsmar, FL	<BR>W912DY-04-D-0007 - 02/27/2004 - Zapata Engineering, P.A.  Charlotte, NC<BR>W912DY-04-D-0008 - 02/27/2004 - Environmental Chemical Corporation  Lakewood, CO<BR>W912DY-04-D-0009 - 04/08/2004 - Explosives Ordnance Tec hnology, Inc.  Rumson, NJ<BR>W912DY-04-D-0010 - 04/08/2004 - Shaw Environmental Group, Inc.  Baton Rouge, LA<BR>W912DY-04-D-0011 - 04/08/2004 - Tetra Tech Environmental Corporation, Inc. - Pasadena, CA <BR>W912DY-04-D-0017 - 06/28/2004 - Alion Science an d Technology Corporation  Chicago, IL<BR>W912DY-04-D-0018 - 06/09/2004 - EOD Technology, Inc.  Lenoir City, TN<BR>W912DY-04-D-0019 - 06/09/2004 - UXB International, Inc.  Blacksburg, VA	<BR><BR>The Huntsville Center supports multiple customers under the se contracts to include the following major customers  Multi-National Corps  Iraq, Multi-National Security Transition Command  Iraq, the US Army, Formerly Used Defense Sites (FUDS), Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP), among others to include foreign governments/agencies where sponsored by an appropriate US Government Agency.  Due to the high costs of fighting the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) and the ever changing requirements of our customers and the c onditions in Iraq, the current programmatic contract capacity has been utilized much faster than originally projected and is expected to be expended by March/April 2008.  This will leave the Huntsville Center without the capability to support the current G WOT mission in Iraq, or the ability to support its current customers within the Continental or Outside the Continental United States (CONUS/OCONUS).  <BR><BR>The primary services required under the current MATOCs are addressed in Section C of the contracts  and require the contractor to have capability to perform conventional and Recovered Chemical Warfare Materiel (RCWM) Munitions Responses and other munitions related services to include site investigations or inspections; remedial investigations; engineeri ng evaluations; remedial or removal actions; long term management (LTM); Munitions and Explosives of Concern (MEC) or other munitions related operations; range clearances; de-mining operations; booby trap clearances; disablement of unconventional warfare explosive devices; site, personnel and convoy security; logistical/life support operations and engineering management; ammunition depot operations and maintenanc e; and instructional capabilities support as necessary.  All or some of these may be necessary to permit lands and waters to be safely and efficiently used for their intended purpose.  MEC and other munitions are a safety hazard and may constitute an immin ent and substantial danger to site personnel and the local populace.  The contractors must be capable of safely locating, identifying, recovering, evaluating, managing and making final disposition of MEC and other munitions at various currently and formerl y used defense sites, property adjoining currently and formerly used defense sites, and other federally controlled/owned sites which have been potentially impacted by MEC or other munitions related operations.    <BR><BR>Special considerations/requirements  for contractors performing the services addressed above in support of the Huntsville Centers customers in Iraq include the requirement to have Theater Business Clearances by the Joint Contracting Command  Iraq/Afghanistan (JCC-I/A) in order to take over  100 percent of the operations within Iraq by 06 March 2008.  Additionally, the contractor must have the ability to self-perform or utilize authorized security subcontractors to perform security operations for site, logistical convoys, or personnel securit y in remote and dangerous environments away from many Forward Operating Bases (FOBs).  Security operation clearances must be obtained by CENTCOM and the Iraqi Government.  Security contractors must comply with and have incorporated all JCC-I/A and theater commander policies and regulations within their contracts/subcontracts.  All contractor and subcontractor personnel must be currently input into the Synchronized Pre-deployment and Operational Tracker (SPOT) system as required under Defense FARs 252.225-70 40 Deviation 2007-O0010  Contractor Personnel in the United States Central Command Area of Responsibility.  These near term requirements which justify the need for this additional programmatic capacity can only be met by contractors who are currently enga ged in performing these types of services in Iraq.<BR><BR>This announcement is being issued to notify all responsible sources of the Huntsville Centers intent.  Again, no solicitation will be issued by the Huntsville Center for this effort at this time. As stated above there will be a new procurement estimated at $2 billion forthcoming.  The replacement contracts have an expected award date of April 2009.  The issuance of the new solicitation will be dependant upon approval of the acquisition strategy by the Army Services Strategy Panel.  Responsible offerors may submit information concerning this notice for consideration to Mr. Michael R. Duffy, Contracting Officer, at Michael.R.Duffy@usace.army.mil on or before 31 January 2008.<BR>

Swaziland is a non-focus, but high priority country under the President?s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (Emergency Plan), a unified USG initiative that is contributing globally to the fight against HIV/AIDS.

Swaziland has the most severe national HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis crisis in the world, with an adult HIV prevalence rate at 42.6 percent. This unprecedented crisis requires an emergency response. Under the Emergency Plan, the United States Government (USG) employs strategies, principles and resources to assist Swaziland in containing, reversing, and mitigating the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

The USG Emergency Plan program works closely with the Government of the Kingdom of Swaziland (GKOS) at all levels to address the policy, advocacy, financial, and technical challenges which constrain Swaziland?s ability to halt the epidemic. Close collaboration is a feature of the significant financial and technical support provided by USG. Additionally, the USG is by far the single largest and most significant contributor to Swaziland?s national response, both through the Emergency Plan and through the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM). USG Emergency Plan resources for Swaziland were $9 million dollars in FY 2007.

The U.S. Mission, the Task Force, and the Emergency Plan program partners have worked collaboratively over the past two years to achieve quality and rapid scale-up of the USG-funded HIV/AIDS programming. The next two years, however, mark an important transition period for the Emergency Plan in Swaziland with a greater in-country staff presence.

B. Program and Position Overview:

The incumbent is designated by the Chief of Mission (Ambassador) or his/her designate, to serve as principal point of contact and coordinator of activities related to the U.S. President?s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief in Swaziland.

The incumbent will facilitate the development and implementation of a unified PEPFAR program for Swaziland that makes best use of the comparative advantages and competencies of participating USG agencies, achieves maximum results related to the Emergency Plan targets, aligns with the Kingdom of Swaziland National Strategic Plan on HIV/AIDS, and is optimally responsive to the needs of Swazis infected and/or affected by HIV/AIDS.

The following provisions and clauses apply to this procurement: FAR 52.204-7, Central Contractor Registration; FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-2, EvaluationýýýCommercial Items; (Jan 1999) (a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: (in relative order of importance) (i) Technical capability of the item offered to meet the Government requirement; (ii) Delivery Schedule (iii) price; and (iv) past performance.  All other evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than price.  (b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).  (c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offerýýýs specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.

<DESC>(2)  QUALITY ASSURANCE SURVEILLANCE PLAN
	(a)  Introduction 
This Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan (QASP) was developed to evaluate Contractor actions while implementing this Performance-Based Work Statement. It is designed to provide an effective surveillance method of monitoring Contractor performance for each listed objective. 
This QASP is based on the premise that the Government desires to maintain a quality standard in the provision of all necessary supplies and services to ensure a successful conference. 
The Contractor, and not the Government, is responsible for all management and quality control actions to meet the terms of the contract. The role of the Government is to monitor quality assurance to ensure all contract standards are achieved. 
In this contract the quality control program is the driver for product quality. Under the terms of the contract, the Contractor is required to develop a comprehensive program of self inspections and self monitoring of its actions. The first major step to ensuring a "self-correcting" contract is to ensure that the quality control program approved at the beginning of the contract provides the measures needed to lead the Contractor to success. 
Once the quality control program is approved by OPM, careful application of the process and standards presented in the remainder of this document will ensure a robust assurance program.

	
(b)  Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan

REQUIRED SERVICE	PERFORMANCE STANDARD	METHOD OF SURVEILLANCE	INCENTIVE/DISINCENTIVE
Timeliness	All products, services and items shall be delivered within established timeframes	Visual	Incentive: Outstanding performance rating

Consistency to Requirements	All products, services and items shall satisfy the requirements of the contract/order	Visual	Incentive: Outstanding performance rating

Surveillance and Monitoring; An agency representative will monitor performance by a system of inspection and random sampling, any complaints received from OPM personnel will be passed on to the Contractor for correction.

OPM-3	Announcement of Contract Award				     [FAR 5.3]

	OPM complies with FAR 5.3, Synopses of Contract Awards, in terms of synopsizing and publicly announcing contract awards. These actions take place at the time of, and not before, the contract is awarded. Contract award, in this case, means signature of the contractual document by the Contracting Officer and forwarding of the contractual document to the contract awardee. If the contract awardee wishes to make a separate public announcement, the awardee must obtain the approval of the Contracting Officer prior to releasing the announcement, and must plan to make announcement only after the contract has been awarded.

	(b)	The Contractor agrees that if an actual or potential OCI is discovered after award, the Contractor shall make a full disclosure in writing to the Contracting Officer.

	(c)	The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if it deems such termination necessary to avoid an OCI. If the Contractor was aware of a potential OCI prior to award or discovered an actual or potential conflict after award and did not disclose or misrepresented relevant information to the Contacting Office, the Government may terminate the contract for default, debar the Contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.

	(d)	The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

		(3)	Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:

			(ii)	Outline in detail the actions to be taken by the Contractor or the Government in the performance of the task to mitigate the conflict, division of subcontractor effort, and limited access to information, or other acceptable means.
	(4)	The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.
	(5)	If the Contracting Officer determines that it is in the best interest of the Government to proceed with work, notwithstanding a conflict of interest, a request for waiver must be submitted in accordance with FAR 9.503.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and written solicitation will not be issued. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is seeking statistical sampling services in the area of Accounts Payable accrual, in accordance with the following Statement of Work: Statement of Work The Contractor will provide all materials, labor and equipment to provide and/or validate a sampling plan, which satisfies the sampling requirement of the Office of the Inspector General and KPMG, in support of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2008 financial statement audit.  The sampling methodology will be determined by the Contractor to provide the smallest sample possible while covering the entire population. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) will accrue a liability amount for FY 2008 based on a three-year historical analysis of actual invoices processed in the accounting system reflecting an invoice date within the first 45 days of the respective fiscal year.  These invoices are examined to determine which FY the goods and services were received.  For example, invoices dated from 10/1/05 to 11/15/05 may represent liabilities for FY 2005 or FY 2006 but were not paid until FY 2006 or later.  In previous years, BIA has worked in conjunction with a Contractor to establish an accepted methodology relating to the Accounts Payable (AP) accrual.  This statement of work defines the work required to build upon the three year trend by sampling the most current fiscal year and combining the results into the methodology.  This work involved shall proceed as follows: ?	The Contractor will be supplied with an electronic file of payments made during FY 2007 no later than January 28th 2008.  Within seven calendar days of receiving the electronic file the Contractor must provide BIA with the stratified sample as consistent with the methodology used in the FY 2006 sample. ?	BIA will then pull the sampled items and review them to determine which fiscal year the goods and services belong.  Results of the BIA review will be submitted to the Contractor no later than noon on March 24th, 2008. The contractor must then merge this data with the data produced in the FY 2007 accrual process to assimilate a complete three fiscal year analysis, culminating with a final projection that will be used in the FY 2008 accrual.  These projection results are due from the Contractor within five calendar days (e.g., if BIA provides results on 3/24 then the Contractor must provide the projection number by 4PM on 3/29). ?	The Contractor must provide a written report describing the sampling approach and results of analysis within seven calendar days after delivering the projected number/error rate.  For example, written report is due 4PM on 4/5 after delivery of AP projected number on 3/29.  The written report must concisely explain methodology, scope and conclusions to allow for subsequent review by BIA management, the OIG, and the external auditors.  Example of a written report is attached. Unless specified otherwise, BIA will send all data files and results of its review to the Contractor electronically via email, FTP, or on CD-rom via overnight mail by 12PM EST of stated deadlines.  All deliverables due from the Contractor must be received by 4PM EST of stated deadlines and must be submitted in soft copies such as Microsoft Excel or Word. During periods of calculation or following the projection the Contractor shall be available for telephone consultation by BIA staff to include a Staff Accountant as well as the Chief of the Financial Reporting and Analysis Division.  These communication sessions may be used to discuss preliminary results, discuss procedural questions, or to provide progress updates. Not to exceed two face-to-face meetings may be requested and would be held at Reston, VA.  The purpose of these meetings would be to discuss the accrual process and/or results and to answer/debrief any questions BIA and KPMG might have.  BIA will provide a minimum of seven calendar days notice regarding the meeting date(s) to allow for travel arraignment by the Contractor.  BIA will reimburse the Contractor for his out-of-pocket travel cost associated with this engagement if such travel should be requested. Except for the out-of-pocket travel costs related to the face-to-face meeting, the Contractor will provide all materials and labor to perform this task at off site.    The period of performance will start upon the final signing of this statement of work and will end on or about April 13th, 2008 following BIA?s acceptance of the Contractor?s written reports.   All firms or individuals responding must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR). The SIC Code is 5812; the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 334119. The following Provisions and Clauses are incorporated and shall remain in full force in any resulting purchase order. FAR Part 52.212-1 Instruction to Offerors ?
