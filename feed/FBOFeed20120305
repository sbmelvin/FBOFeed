The effectiveness of the proposed project team (management structure and coordination of disciplines, offices and/or subcontractors) is also considered. <br />(3) Capacity: The firm's available capacity of key disciplines and experience with similar size projects is evaluated. This evaluation may be based upon the amount of other work currently being performed by the A-E and the overall size of the firm.<br />(4) Past Performance: Past performance on contracts with government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work and compliance with performance schedules. References and letters of commendation are also evaluated.

<p>The NAICS code is 238220 and the Size Standard is $14M.</p>
<p>In accordance with FAR 4.1102 and DFARS 252.204-7004"Required Central Contractor Registration," Contractor must be registered in CCR prior to award. Registration may be accomplished at http://www.ccr.gov.</p>
<p>SOLICITATION NUMBER: FA8601-12-B-0002<br />This effort includes one project: (Project 090187), Replace Steam Lines, Area A. Project scope includes replacement of steam heat system from underground steam distribution lines with gas-fired boiler heating systems for Bldgs 879, 867, 278, 256, 1403, 293, 295 and 296. Remove overhead steam lines at Bldgs 278 and 867. The heating system components are assumed to contain asbestos containing insulating materials. Also included is the replacement of the steam heating coil inside the air handling units inside the facilities listed above, with a new hot water heating coil, along with the installation of a new HTHW to heating hot water heat exchanger, hot water pump, and new DDC controls. Special requirements/concerns related to this project: <br />High Temperature Hot Water (HTHW) steam distribution systems require specialized construction skills and safety preparations. Standard facility construction experience is not sufficient. Construction timelines are very tight since these repairs cannot be started until after the steam heating system is turned off, and must be completed in time for activation in the fall for this critical utility system. Numerous facilities will not have heat until this project is completed. Work will need to be carefully coordinated with the Mechanical Shop to minimize impact to mission. Project also includes HVAC and asbestos work.</p>

<p>The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) seeks a vendor to service the Indian Tribal Organizations (ITOs) participating in a Regional Vendor Pilot (hereafter referred to as the Pilot or RVP), conducted as part of the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). Specifically, the vendor would be required to accept orders for foods that comprise the FDPIR food package from participating ITOs; and deliver those foods to those organizations, in good condition, according to a negotiated schedule, and cost effectively. <br /><br />Background</p>
<p>FNS' mission is to reduce hunger and food insecurity, in partnership with cooperating organizations, by providing children and needy people access to food, a healthful diet, and nutrition education in a manner that supports American agriculture. FNS achieves this mission by administering USDA's 15 domestic nutrition assistance programs. <br /><br />Among those programs is FDPIR, which provides food to low income households living on Indian reservations and Native American families residing in designated areas near reservations. FDPIR was established as an alternative to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) because such areas often do not have easy access to grocery stores. <br />Current FDPIR Operational Environment</p>
<p>Under FDPIR's current food distribution model, USDA buys food, which is sent to two USDA-contracted warehouses, both in Missouri. From there, food is distributed to ITOs and State agencies that administer FDPIR. This is known as the National Warehouse Model.</p>
<p>The National Warehouse Model is not ideal because it does not provide sufficient opportunities to incorporate local and traditional foods into the FDPIR food package and has high costs associated with the centralized storage and trans-national transportation of food.</p>
<p>Additionally, sites also receive fresh fruits and vegetables delivered by the Department of Defense. However, this Program will not be part of the Pilot and will continue as currently operated. <br /><br />Background and Goal of FDPIR Regional Vendor Pilot<br />FNS intends to pilot a Regional Distribution Model, starting in calendar year 2012. FNS will select a limited number of ITOs to participate in this Pilot, which will be "grouped" in one geographic area. There are several natural "Groupings" of ITOs throughout the nation.<br />Under the proposed Pilot, USDA would contract with a vendor, which would service the Grouping selected to participate in the Pilot. Specifically, the vendor would buy USDA-approved items and distribute them directly to the ITOs, which would then prepare and distribute FDPIR food packages to program participants. This would be known as the Regional Vendor Pilot (RVP), or the Pilot.</p>
<p>To be successful, the vendor selected for the Pilot must (at minimum) successfully and consistently (1) accept orders for foods that comprise the FDPIR food package from participating ITOs and Tribes, (2) deliver those foods to those organizations, (3) according to a negotiated schedule, (4) in good condition and (5) be cost-effective. <br /><br />Other anticipated benefits of the Pilot include (1) incorporation of traditional foods into the FDPIR food package, (2) greater opportunity to purchase foods from Native American producers, and (3) improved customer service for FDPIR organizations and program participants.</p>
<p>The Groupings Thirty-one (31) Tribes and/or ITOs expressed interest in participatin. Based on the geographic proximity of those Tribes/ITOs to each other, FNS has identified the following five probable Groupings:</p>
<p>&bull; Midwest Grouping (Grouping #1) is composed of ITOs in Nebraska, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan. Approximately 5.1 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 17 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; Southwest Grouping (Grouping #2) is composed of ITOs in Oklahoma, New Mexico and Arizona. Approximately 6.7 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 17 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; Oklahoma Grouping (Grouping #3) is composed of ITOs in Oklahoma. Approximately 4.9 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 7 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; New Mexico/Arizona Grouping (Grouping #4) is composed of New Mexico and Arizona. Approximately 1.8 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The multi-food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 10 different locations.</p>
<p>&bull; Northwest Grouping (Grouping #5) is composed of ITOs in California, Oregon and Washington. Approximately 3.9 million pounds of multi-food shipments are delivered on an annual basis. The food shipments for this Grouping would go to approximately 8 different locations. <br /><br />Only one of the Groupings will be selected to participate in the Pilot.</p>

The AxioImager microscope was chosen based on performance and compatibility with existing Zeiss equipment. The Zeiss AxioImager M2 Microscope will enable NHGRI to re-use existing objectives (40X, 63X and 100X) and filter sets that are already developed, as well as, the ASI Spectra-cube specialized equipment (86K), that needs to be aligned and placed on a dedicated microscope. ASI Spectra-Cube/software is also configured to control the Zeiss microscope filer wheel and objective turret to perform experiments without manual interactions. This unique piece of equipment will allow post-docs and principal investigator's to obtain Karyotyping, SKY, chromosome analysis and FISH that cannot be done on any other piece of equipment at NHGRI. Due to the old and malfunctioned microscope already in place, this new equipment, will allow the core to continue with their research studies without disruption to the analyses or data collected.</p>

<a href="mailto:Marsha.R.Sells@usace.army.mil">USACE District, Sacramento</a>
<DESC>The maintenance dredging for the Stockton and Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channels (DWSC) is conducted on an annual basis.  The Sacramento DWSC is contained within the confines of the Sacramento River and the man-made portion of the ship channel.  The Stockton DWSC follows the San Joaquin River.  Due to natural sediment load moving down through these rivers, shoals develop which compromise the authorized depths of both ship channels.  These shoals cause draft restrictions which increase the cost and safety for the shipping industry.  Historically, approximately 200,000 to 400,000 cubic yards of shoaled material has been dredged annually.  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is authorized by Congress to maintain both shipping channels to their authorized depths.  Due to endangered species, the fisheries window for maintenance dredging is Aug 1 through Nov 30.  After the winter storm run-off, the USACE conducts bathymetric surveys used to determine the shoaling that has developed.  The USACE also develops the Notice of Intent (NOI) which is presented the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB).  The NOI is used by the CVRWQCB to issue the Clean Water Act Section 401 Water Quality Certification in the form a Notice of Applicability (NOA).   <br>   <br>This solicitation will be for a 3 year Indefinite-Delivery Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a maximum capacity of $10M per year for a total contract capacity of $30M.  The estimated dredge quantities for the Task Orders will be developed from the NOA and bathymetric surveys.  The pricing for Task Orders will be based on the individual pricing schedule set for each year of the contract. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Acquisition Information:<br><br>THIS ACQUISITION IS PROCEEDING AS A UNRESTRICTED COMPETITIVE, INVITATION FOR BID (IFB). <br><br>Minimum Guarantee of $20,000.00, Not-to-Exceed Value is $10,000,000.00 per year<br><br>Period of Performance for Construction:  To be Determined per Task Order<br><br>This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Z216, SIC CODE: 1629, NAICS Code: 237990.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command intends to procure on a sole source basis, Field Service Engineering Support (FSEs) within the Marine Area of Operations (AO), Helmand Province, Afghanistan theatre of operations from General Dynamics C4 Systems 8201 East McDowell Street, Scottsdale, AZ 85252. 

The justification permitting other than full and open competition10 U.S.C. Section 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements. The exception to fair opportunity for this action is provided for in paragraph 6.302-1(a)(iii), which states, For DoD, NASA and the Coast Guard, services may be deemed to be available from the original source in the case of follow-on contracts for the continued provision of highly specialized services when it is likely that award to any other source would result in - (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencys requirements.

A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for FSEs services is anticipated.
 The total estimated cost of this acquisition is $600,000.00. The Period of Performance is from 25 March 2012 until 05 June 2012 (approximately 2.5 months). 

The Combat Operations Center Family of Systems (COC FoS), to include the Command Post of the Future (CPOF)  application has been used as the Common Operational Picture (COP) of choice in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) since 2009. The COC has historically been supported in both peacetime and wartime via FSEs sourced solely by General Dynamics C4 Systems (GDC4S).  GDC4S is the Prime Vendor, developer, and integrator for the COC FoS, and has supported approximately 40 OEF systems of varying sizes with staffing levels as high as 30 FSEs in the early years and has gradually drawn down to 11 FSEs in recent months due to funding constraints within the program office.
  With the COC Prime Vendor Contract ending in March 2012, the COC Program Office has identified Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity (MCTSSA) Technical Support to Operating Forces (TSOF) as the logical choice for continued FSE support. 


In the interest of economy and efficiency, this contract prevents any gaps in support and will provide continuity to the Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) (FWD) during their Relief in Place/Transfer of Authority (RIP/TOA) and allow for the endgame MCTSSA TSOF contract to come online.  An award to any other source would require an additional 45 to 60 days to complete as well as otherwise avoidable contractor infrastructure and start up costs for four FSEs supporting such the transition to TSOF (technical and program management, administrative, pre-deployment screening travel, airfare), and most certainly degrade support performance provided to the MEF during RIP/TOA due to the learning curve associated with existing deployed support processes, structure and requirements of the mission.

No request for proposal is available for competitive bidding.
 However, interested parties are encouraged to submit a statement of capability for satisfying this requirement. All communications shall be in writing. Proprietary information shall be clearly identified as such and will be protected

<DESC>This is NOT a Request for Proposal. Respondents shall be responsible for any costs associated with preparing responses to this market research. This is NOT a developmental effort.<br><br>This Request for Information (RFI) supports a market survey being conducted by PM Soldier Warrior (PM SWAR). On 15 Nov 2011, in a sources sought solicitation (W91CRB11RTCAP) PM-SWAR requested information to support a market survey to determine potential sources for a Tactical Communications and Protective System (TCAPS). Several information papers were received for products that required over-the-ear headsets and in-the-ear solutions with an interface/control box. Companies that submitted a paper on this type of configuration do NOT need to submit a paper for such configuration again in response to this Request for Information (RFI). <br><br>This RFI reflects PM-SWAR interest in market information for IN-THE-EAR SOLUTIONS and/or wire-free OVER-THE-EAR SOLUTIONS THAT REQUIRE NO INTERFACE/CONTROL BOX and the additional characteristics provided in a separate attachment (Hearing Devices Potential Configurations Chart). The attached chart provides four configurations that PM-SWAR considers might provide a feasible solution to TCAPS. <br><br>TCAPS devices serve three basic purposes: First is to provide protection from high ambient noise; both continuous type (vehicle noise) and impulse type (gunfire and explosions). Second is to enable clear communications in noisy environments while simultaneously providing hearing protection. Third is to provide capability for verbal conversation and ambient sounds to preserve auditory situational awareness and localization in all noise environments. <br><br>This RFI will help the Government to gain an understanding of whether or not industry is capable of producing systems in accordance with the attached draft performance specification, which may be revised depending on comments received. The Government remains open to changing these requirements if a novel and elegant commercial solution is provided in response to this RFI.<br><br>Companies who desire to participate in this market survey are highly encouraged to submit a response which supports the company's claim that it presently has the technology, qualifications, and capabilities to satisfy ONE OR MORE OF THE PERFORMANCE AND TECHNICAL OBJECTIVES described above and in the draft specification. Companies should provide a ROM (rough order of magnitude) price, its anticipated availability date, delivery lead time and maximum monthly production quantity for the solution proposed. Respondents shall also discuss whether their product is considered commercial in accordance with "commercial item" definition found in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 2.101. <br><br>The response should include point(s) of contact. The response should be prepared in MS Word, limited to no more than ten (10) pages with no additional attachments. Submit response to BOTH the Contract Specialist at dominic.milligan@us.army.mil and the Contracting Officer at thomas.marousek@us.army.mil. ALL requests for further information must be made via email. Telephone requests for additional information will not be honored.<br><br>For questions, potential respondents shall email the Contract Specialist at dominic.milligan@us.army.mil. The government will review submissions as they are received. No report or feedback on your submission will be provided.<br><br>RESPONSES ARE DUE NO LATER THAN FRIDAY 16 MARCH 2012 AT 10:00 AM EST. However, the government reserves the right to close this Sources Sought notice once they have received adequate responses.<br><br>See attachments for further details.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION:     This is a request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  The government does not intend to award a contract from this announcement or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, but is seeking information on available sources capable of providing a firefighting aircraft study resulting in a report identifying the appropriate number and types of aviation resources necessary to effectively meet future fire management needs. <br />The U.S. Department of Agriculture -Forest Service (USFS) has a multi-faceted mission that involves management of the National Forest System, cooperating with State and local agencies, and providing wildfire protection.  The aerial firefighting mission is extremely complex in terms of aircraft use, aircraft characteristics, bases, contracts, costs, dispatching, mission objectives, tactics, strategy and communications. The USFS contracts large fixed-wing aircraft configured with retardant delivery systems to drop retardant on wildfires.  These aircraft are commonly referred to as airtankers (Type 1 &gt;3000 gallons and Type 2 1800-2999 gallons).  The Forest Service also contracts heavy helicopters for water delivery to the fireline.  Fixed-wing water scooper aircraft have not been directly contracted to the USFS, but have been used through interagency contracts and agreements.  Under current practices, the USFS uses a broad range of tactical and strategic approaches with airtankers including direct and indirect attack under initial attack, extended attack and large fire support.
<p>A USFS-appointed Technical Team (USFS Team) consisting of fire operations specialist, fire scientists, an aviation specialist, and fire planners, will oversee this analysis, provide data and data access and provide subject matter expertise. A USFS Team Project Leader will be identified to the contractor upon contract award.</p>
<p>GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:     The Forest Service Incident Support Branch is seeking small business vendors who can provide research and analysis to include <br />1) Review of the scientific literature and internal or contracted reports related to airtanker, helicopter and scooper use, aircraft characteristics, bases, contracts, costs, dispatching, mission objectives, tactics, strategy and communications which identify how the variety of aviation missions have been modeled in the past and a review of past studies to identify the primary factors that influence appropriate fleet composition.<br />2) Define the utility and operational parameters of large airtankers (LAT), heavy helicopters (defined as Type 1), and water scoopers in accomplishing the variety of aviation missions supporting wildfire management, including summary of the circumstances (fire management types; Type 5- Type 1, fire size, missions, basing, dispatching, geographic and logistical factors) under which each aircraft type can effectively operate. The data in the final report shall be documented by aircraft class (LAT, heavy helicopters and water scoopers) and aircraft type; and <br />3) Examine recent (CY 2000- CY 2011)aviation usage trends (including fire type/size) and explore how various combinations of new and existing aviation resources could meet capacity and demand levels projected from historical use. Access to the data will be provided by the FS immediately after contract award. This analysis shall identify the appropriate mix of airtankers (Type 1 and Type 2), heavy helicopters (Type 1) and water scoopers.</p>
<p>SUBMITTAL INFORMATION: Qualified Interested Offerors must respond to Kellen Logan, by Wednesday, February 15, 3:00 PM MST. via email: klogan@fs.fed.us. Questions should be submitted by email as well.</p>

<p>Sources Sought Notice Information</p>
<p>General Information<br />Document Type: Sources Sought Notice<br />Solicitation Number: Reference Number: HHS-NIH-NIAID(AI)-SBSS-12-142<br />Posted Date: March 5, 2012<br />Original Response Date: March 20, 2012<br />Current Response Date: March 20, 2012<br />Original Archive Date: <br />Current Archive Date: <br />Classification Code: A -- Research &amp; Development<br />NAICS Code: 541712 -Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering and Life Sciences</p>
<p>Introduction<br />This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; women-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The mission of the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is to ensure an end to the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic by supporting research that can lead to the development of therapies, vaccines and prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Since the mid -1980s, animal models have played an important role in the NIAID's efforts to achieve its mission. Nonhuman primate (NHP) models present the opportunity to test a variety of candidate AIDS vaccines, optimizing their ability to elicit immune responses and testing their ability to prevent infection or to control virus replication after virus challenge. The NIAID provides immunological and virological support for NHP studies conducted at NIAID's Simian Vaccine Evaluation Unit (SVEU) contract sites and by DIADS-supported vaccine researchers through three existing NHP Core Laboratories (NHP Core Labs), which are: the Humoral Immunology Core Lab, the Cellular Immunology Core Lab and the Viral Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) Core Lab. The NHP Core Functional Genomics Laboratory will thus become a fourth NHP Core Lab, with the objective of ensuring standardization and comparability of functional genomics services and assays conducted for these SVEU and DAIDS-supported preclinical NHP studies. The ultimate aim is to apply and refine high throughput functional genomic approaches in NHPs to more effectively evaluate vaccine-induced adaptive and innate immune responses and vaccine efficacy in challenge/protection studies and identify responses (e.g., transcriptomic "signatures") that predict vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives <br />The purpose of the proposed contract will be to support both ongoing and new high-priority preclinical NHP protocols within the SVEU contracts and selected meritorious DAIDS grant-supported NHP projects testing preclinical prophylactic AIDS vaccines. Specifically, this contract will provide support for a NHP Core Functional Genomics Laboratory for the conduct and improvement of services and assays designed to generate specific quantitative genomic expression profiles (e.g., RNA transcriptomic "signatures") and network diagrams (using established Pathway Analysis programs) from RNA samples obtained from NHPs enrolled in priority SVEU protocols and DAIDS-supported investigator-initiated NHP studies. It is anticipated that during the years of this contract, the assays performed by the NHP Core Functional Genomics Laboratory will change as new technologies are developed.</p>
<p>Project Requirements<br />The Contractor shall compile and analyze the generated data using bioinformatics and biocomputing tools (e.g., unbiased hierarchical clustering methods, sophisticated network algorithms, etc.) with the intent of identifying gene signatures that could potentially define correlates of protection and predict vaccine efficacy.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Contractor shall be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>&bull; Establishing and applying a state-of-the-art high throughput microarray/transcriptomic platform/assay system to generate specific gene expression profiles (transcriptomic "signatures") from NHPs enrolled in priority SVEU protocols and studies supported by investigator-initiated grants;</p>
<p>&bull; Adopting state-of-the-art high throughput microarray/transcriptomic platform/assay systems as improved or alternative technologies develop, including increasing sensitivity and reproducibility, improving standardization, achieving greater throughput and lowering costs;</p>
<p>&bull; Compliance with Good Clinical Laboratory Practices (GCLP) [http://apps.who.int/tdr/svc/publications/tdr-research-publications/gclp-web] and BSL2;</p>
<p>&bull; Optimization and validation of assays; and</p>
<p>&bull; Compiling and analyzing gene expression data using appropriate bioinformatics and biocomputing tools (e.g., unbiased hierarchical clustering methods, sophisticated network algorithms, etc.).</p>
<p>Though assay development will not be supported under this contract, the Contractor will be expected to have an understanding of and expertise in assay development.</p>
<p><br />Anticipated Period of Performance<br />It is anticipated that one (1) cost reimbursement, level-of-effort (term) type contract will be awarded. The period of performance will be for one (1) year (Base Period) plus four (4) one-year options (terms) that may be exercised by the Government unilaterally, for a total possible performance period of five (5) years, beginning on or about June 17, 2013. The requirement will be for the delivery of 3.85 full time equivalents (FTEs) per year for the Base Period (Year 1) and each option period (Years 2 through 5).</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may unilaterally exercise options for increased level-of-effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the conduct of RNA microarray/transcriptomic assays and analyses. It is estimated that 0.95 FTE/year will be needed for each option. The Government may unilaterally exercise an option up to two times in any year of the contract.</p>
<p>Capability Statement/Information Sought<br />Capability Statements should clearly convey information regarding the respondent's capabilities, including: (a) staff expertise, including their availability, experience, and formal and other training; (b) current in-house capability and capacity to perform the work; (c) prior completed projects of similar nature; (d) corporate experience and management capability; and (e) examples of prior completed Government contracts, references, and other related information;</p>
<p>Interested contractors must submit a capability statement (five page limitation, excluding resumes) describing their company's experience and ability to perform this effort which includes the following: (1) a summary list of similar work previously performed; (2) the professional qualifications and specific experience of staff who may be assigned to the requirement; (3) resumes for proposed key personnel, including the Principal Investigator/co-PI, which reflect education, and previous work relevant to the proposed requirement; (4) a general description of the facilities and other resources needed to perform the work; and (5) demonstrated ability to carry out the work.</p>

<DESC>If interested, please forward a capabilities statement to michael.fanizzo@navy.mil by Noon EST, 9 March 2012. The statement should provide background information such as past performance history, facilities description, and entity size. The statement should also describe relevant products, specifically system capacity, weight, and lead time. The statements should be less than ten pages. 

To optimize operational flexibility and minimize cost, NAVFAC intends to procure two dual source power systems: 
1) 3KW single phase 120 VAC system and 
2) 5KW single and three-phase system (specifically 120 VAC, single-phase, 2-wire; 120/240 VAC single-phase, 3-wire; and 120/208 VAC, 3-phase, 4 wire).

BACKGROUND.
Navy Special Warfare (NSW) will deploy power systems to generate, manage, store, and distribute electric power.
  The Navys energy efforts afloat and ashore aim to increase combat capability by reducing overall consumption of energy, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and significantly increasing the use of alternative energy.   To reduce fossil fuel consumption and eventually conduct Net-Zero operations in Village Stability Platforms (VSP), NSW will: 1) reduce the fuel demand with energy efficient technology; 2) efficiently utilize currently available technology; and 3) implement new fuel efficient and renewable energy technologies to further reduce the demand of fossil fuels.  
NSW intends to reduce petroleum fuel consumption by as much as 85% by using Smart technologies to capture energy from the sun and power equipment.
  Testing indicates that this will reduce fuel consumption by as much as 80%. 

JOINT REQUIREMENTS.
As deployed systems, system weight greatly impacts operations. The 3KW system shall not exceed 500 pounds; the 5KW shall not exceed 650 pounds. Each separable component shall weigh no more than 140 lbs to enable transport by no more than two people.  The requirements of MIL-STD-1472 or ASTM F 1166 shall be used as guidance.  See www.everyspec.com for this guidance.
Delivery of both systems within 30 days of contract award.

Both systems shall accept and distribute various power inputs, provide output control signals for auto start/stop capability of the deployed generators, and manage output power.
 The controller shall contain all necessary power receptacles, electronic circuits, hardware, software, and control devices.

Both systems shall automatically start/stop, parallel/balance, phase match/balance all input AC and DC sources to the load/demand and storage state of charge via a standard diagnostics connector (T). The system shall autonomously select, start/stop, parallel/balance, phase match/balance multiple input generators of appropriate size to match load/demand and shall have the capability for an operator to manually input start/stop parameters, including time of day and defined quiet periods via a touch-screen display (O).

Both systems shall have a minimum usable energy density of 90 Wh/kg (f), 180 Wh/kg (O) including packaging; a minimum electrical capacity of 60 Ah; and a minimum usable cycle life defined as 80% of Beginning of Life (BOL) capacity of 2,500 cycles (T), 5,000 cycles (O).

Power output shall be of no lower quality than the input power: typically Type I power.
 The systems shall not introduce any Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) greater or eq to 5% (T) or 3% (O) and shall not introduce any individual Harmonic Distortion (IHD) greater or eq to 3% (T) or 1% (O).

SPECIFIC 5KW REQUIREMENTS.
1. The 5KW shall provide at least a 60% reduction in fossil fuels while providing at least 5 KW of power, 24 hours per day, seven days per week, for one calendar year. It shall also interface with the Navys 3KW and 10KW Tactical Quiet Generators.	
2. The system shall have a minimum energy capacity of 3.0KwH (T), 5.0 KwH (O).
4. The system shall be installed into the bed of a Light Tactical Trailer.  The system must fit inside the footprint of the LTT with the 5KW TQG installed as well.
5.
 The 5KW system shall intelligently distribute input power between power outputs and the storage based on load requirements, storage state of charge, and operator-defined priorities. (T) 

SPECIFIC 3KW REQUIREMENTS.
1. The 3 KW shall provide at least a 60% reduction in fossil fuels while providing at least 3 KW of power, 24 hours per day, seven days per week, for one calendar year. It shall interface with the Navys 3KW Tactical Quiet Generator.	
2. The system shall have a minimum energy capacity of 2.5KwH (T), 3.0 KwH (O).
3. The 3KW shall be shock-mounted inside containers and secured for transport via ship/ rail/ air, normal road conditions, off-road conditions, and forklift.

This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the 13.106 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
 There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500.

However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Along with the capabilities statement vendors must also confirm that the single head ceiling mounted lights along with the installation kit meet the shock test standards set forth in MIL-S-901D (IAW FAR 11.2 available for download at https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/).
  Specifically, the vendor shall provide a Certificate from an approved independent test activity verifying and specifically stating on the Certificate from the approved test activity, that the lights meet category MIL-S-901D, Grade A, Class I or Class II, Type A testing.  Any and all lights being proposed as primary or alternate proposals shall pass MIL-S-901D testing independently of others offered.
A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Extend Occupational Health RN Services
<SOLNBR>N6264511P0185
<CONTACT>
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to extend the period of performance on an existing contract via a modification to contract N62645-11-P-0185 under the statutory authority U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  The government intends to extend the period of performance by six months, from 01 October 2011  31 March 2012 to 01 October 2011  30 September 2012.  The contract was awarded to American Hospital Services Group, LLC, 415 Eagleview Boulevard, Suite 108, Exton, Pennsylvania 19341-1143 for Occupational Health Registered Nurse services in support of Marine Corps Logistics Base, Barstow, CA.  

The contract was originally awarded to cover services through March 31 2012 while allowing sufficient time to compete the follow-on requirement.
  However, unanticipated delays were experienced in regard to the requiring activity and defining the follow-on requirement, and as a result there is not ample time to solicit, receive responses, conduct evaluations, make an award, and reasonably expect there would be enough time for a contractor to be able to recruit for and fill the position, including obtaining all security clearances, by March 31 2012.

These factors have resulted in the need to issue a contract modification to N62645-11-P-0185 to extend services through September 30 2012.

There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The contract action will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 622110 with a Small Business Size Standard of $34.5 million dollars.
  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement.  However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data sufficient to determine capability in providing the same services from 01 April 2012  30 September 2012. All capability statements received within 15 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to extend services based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. 

Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Carrie Hickman at Carrie.Hickman@med.navy.mil (in subject line reference: Extension of Occupational Health RN Services).
  Statements are due no later than March 21 2012, 05:00 PM EST.  No phone calls accepted.

<DESC>Notice of Sole Source Intent
This notice is not a request for competitive quotes.  The Bureau of Reclamation, Great Plains Regional Office intends to exercise Option Year II of Contract Number R10PX60080 for Security Surveillance and Law Enforcement services throughout Larimer County, Colorado. Reclamation has security management responsibilities for several dams, powerplants, and surrounding lands located in Larimer County, Colorado.  Reclamation's authority to administer lands and waters does not include law enforcement authority.  However, Reclamation does have authority to establish contracts with local law enforcement agencies to enforce federal regulations as appropriate.  Reclamation has found the Larimer County Sheriff's Office to be the only source with full arrest authority to successfully complete the required security and surveillance services.  
This option is being exercised pursuant to FAR Part 17 of the Federal Acquisition Regulations.  Since Reclamation believes that only one responsible source can fully provide the services that will satisfy the agency's requirements, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition was prepared and approved by the Great Plains Regional Office Chief of Contracting on April 13, 2009.  In accordance with Part 6.305, the Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition was publicly posted March 28, 2009.
The Government intends to exercise the option on May 31, 2012.  Vendors that have questions regarding the sole source nature of the requirement or vendors that believe they can fully provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contract Specialist.  In order to allow for sufficient Government consideration and potential quote evaluation, vendors shall submit their written Letter of Interest no later than March 31, 2012.  Responses received after March 31, 2012 may not be considered by the Government.
Responses to this notice shall be mailed to the Bureau of Reclamation - GP-5000; PO Box 36900; Billings, Montana 59107, or faxed to 406-247-7798, Attn:  Amanda Somerville, or e-mailed to asomerville@usbr.gov.  All responses should include the vendor's Duns and Bradstreet (DUNS) Number and Tax Identification Number (TIN).  Vendors should additionally identify themselves as either a "small business" or an "other than small business" under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 561612.  The applicable Small Business Size Standard is $18.5 million.
A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement.  
Note 1:  Effective October 1, 2003, (FAR 4.1102) any contractor interested in doing business with the federal government shall be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database prior to award of a contract or agreement.  Contractors may register at http://www.ccr.gov.
Note 2:  Effective January 1, 2005, (FAR 4.1202) prospective contractors shall complete electronic annual representations and certifications at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with the required registration in the CCR database.

<DESC>In accordance with FAR subpart 6.302-1(c) (ii), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC/NCHHSTP/DTBE, intends to issue a solesource purchase order to The University of of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth.
<p>Project Title: A Manuscript on the development of a TB economic tool and <br />an evidence-based desktop tool to guide tuberculosis program resource allocation</p>
<p>This project has two objectives:</p>
<p>(1) to produce a publishable manuscript that will provide the theoretical background and mathematical model for development of a TB economic tool. The target audience of the manuscript will include health economists, mathematicians, and risk modelers, who read journals such as American Journal of Epidemiology, American Journal of Public Health, American Journal of Public Health Management, and Annals of Epidemiology. The manuscript will be sent through CDC clearance channels upon receipt from the vendor. Throughout development of the manuscript, the vendor will independently draft the manuscript and submit iterations to the CDC Project Officer for review and comment. This manuscript is important to the CDC mission because it will provide peer-reviewed support for the validity of the economic tool that is to be produced as the second objective.</p>
<p>(2) to create a user-friendly electronic tool with a web-based or another appropriate interface that will allow local users to model, examine and compare the costs and outcomes of potential TB program investments such as use of different types of tests for latent TB infections, extent of testing for latent TB infection, and effect of reducing or increasing testing and impact of different types of professionals, decisions, or changes in the context of their current setting. This is important to the CDC mission of TB elimination because it will allow local programs to make cost-effective decisions that will preserve the momentum towards elimination.</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for supplying CDC with a manuscript that will be ready for clearance through CDC processes and submitted for peer review that outlines the theoretical and mathematical basis for the TB economics tool and a validated tool, either Web-based or based on Excel or another simple program available to most TB controllers, that will allow the user to compare costs and outcomes of different program investments by inserting values for key program costs and outcomes and a Word document that explains use of the tool.</p>
<p>It is the understanding of the Government that an award to any other source would cause unacceptable delays in meeting the requirements of the Government. Interested parties who feel that they possess the capabilities to provide the services described above should submit a capability statement demonstrating their abilities to provide the services. The information received in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive requirement. Please send your documentation to Deborah Workman by fax (770) 488-8350, or email to atl7@cdc.gov. Documentation should be received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis to be considered by CDC. A determination by the CDC not to compete this proposed contract, based upon responses to this notification, is solely within discretion of the government.</p>

<DESC>NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA solicits interest from companiesinterested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market thefollowing technology. License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basisand may include specific fields of use. THE TECHNOLOGY: NASA Langley researchers have developed a novel noise reduction system for jet engines.Aircraft jet engine noise is a major issue for airports, the communities near airports,and, of course, for the jet engine designers. Even with the use of recenthigh-bypass-ratio jet engine designs, noise continues to be a major concern. The presentinnovation represents a significant advancement to the concept of using mechanicallyfixed chevrons on the trailing edge of jet engine nozzles to reduce noise. While theeffect of chevrons on noise reduction is well known, commercial implementation has beenlimited. Unfortunately, the turbulence created with the chevrons, while useful forreducing noise upon takeoff, serves to reduce efficiency during cruising. The presentinnovation is a simple noise reduction system with effects similar to that of chevrons,yet it is active and controllable to maximize noise reduction while maintainingefficiency.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

THE TECHNOLOGY: Aircraft jet engine noise remains a major issue for airports, communities near airports,and of course for jet engine designers. NASA Langley and NASA Glenn researchers havedeveloped a novel approach to mitigate the noise generated from exit guide vanes used inhigh-bypass-ratioturbofan engines. Exit guide vanes provide increased thrust and efficiency by controllingthe swirl in the downstream engine flow generated by the turbofan. The interaction ofthis swirling flow with the stationary guide vanes, however, is a significant source ofnoise. Design of the vane shapes and placement have allowed for some reduction in theamount of noise generated. Sound-absorbing linings in the ducting are also used to reducethis turbofan noise as it passes through the engine nacelle. The NASA innovationdescribed here, however, represents a novel design for the construction of the stationaryexit guide vanes to reduce the noise at its source.To express interest in this opportunity, please respond to Sean Sullivan, ResearchTriangle International (RTI),  at: NASA Langley Research Center, Strategic RelationshipsOffice (SRSO),	17 West Taylor St., Mail Stop 218, Building 1212, Room 110 Hampton,Virginia, E-mail: Sean.D.Sullivan@NASA.gov,  or phone: 757-864-5055.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Acquisition Management Division, on behalf of the NIST Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), intends to negotiate with Aware, Inc.; Bedford, MA, on a sole source basis under the authority of FAR Subpart 13.106-1 (b), Soliciting from a Single Source, to Aware WSQ1000 Software Licenses.<br /><br />This project supports FBI biometrics research and development objectives in automated fingerprint-matching system testing, and standards through an ongoing FBI-NIST collaboration.
<p>NIST has been in collaboration with the FBI since 1968 in conducting research on automated fingerprint-matching systems. Since 2008, with the help and support from the FBI, the current legacy fingerprint-matching test environment at NIST is in a transitional phase to update our current supercomputer based architecture to the new blade-based Next Generation Identification (NGI) system currently in operation at the FBI. The new blade-based NGI system architecture utilizes a fingerprint-matching system designed specifically for the FBI's current operational system, in which NIST is requested by the FBI to install at NIST on FBI supplied hardware to remain in sync with the FBI's operational system. Transition and updating of the NIST fingerprint-matching system to duplicate the fingerprint-matching subsystem of the FBI's new NGI system is critical for NIST to remain in sync with the operational behavior of the FBI system, to ensure repeatability of our testing framework, and to maintain this long standing collaboration.  The Aware WSQ1000 is the only software that will allow NIST to duplicate the FBI's system.  Aware, Inc is the sole provider of the Aware WSQ1000 software licenses.</p>
<p>The NAICS Code is 511210 with a Size Standard of $25.0 million.  NIST anticipates negotiating and awarding a firm-fixed-price purchase order to Aware, Inc. for this requirement.</p>
<p>Interested parties that believe they could satisfy the requirements listed above for NIST may clearly and unambiguously identify their capability to do so in writing on or before the response date for this notice. This notice of intent is not a solicitation.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether competitive procedures could be used for this acquisition.

<SOLNBR>TH57RFI
<CONTACT>Amanda Jones, Contract Specialist, Email amanda.jones2@navy.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION: TH-57TS TRAINING PIPELINE ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) is soliciting information from industry partners on potential alternative solutions to the existing Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA) advanced rotary wing training pipeline. NAVAIR seeks to identify if alternatives exist to our current contracting strategy and training construct that would provide better training at a lower cost. In order to adequately evaluate potential solutions it is requested that detailed performance and cost data be provided to the Government for consideration. This Request for Information (RFI) is designed to solicit long term solutions and will not conflict with the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) (N00019-10-R-0097) for the follow-on Contractor Logistics Support (CLS) contract in support of the existing fleet of TH-57 helicopters. This announcement is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted in response to this RFI. Contractors are directed to submit ONLY non-proprietary information in response to this RFI. This RFI does not commit the Government to award a contract. This RFI is for market research only and any procurement resulting from this announcement will be synopsized separately.</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The CNATRA mission is to train the world's finest combat quality aviation professionals, delivering them at the right time, in the right numbers, and at the right cost to the Joint Forces for tasking. Headquartered in Corpus Christi, TX, CNATRA conducts all naval undergraduate flight training preparing Student Naval Aviators (SNAs) for designation as Naval Aviators. One component of CNATRA training is Advanced Helicopter Training (AHT) in which SNAs learn the skills necessary to fly rotary wing aircraft. Each year the AHT pipeline produces 550-650 Naval Aviators (on average 20-25 students bi-weekly) represented from multiple services (U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Coast Guard, and foreign military partners). The current AHT system is comprised of two integrated sub-systems: the aircraft (TH-57 B/C - commercial derivative Bell 206B) and the corresponding Ground Based Training System (GBTS). The current TH-57 fleet consists of 44 TH-57B models, used for contact and tactics training, and 73 TH-57C models, used for instrument and navigation training. Of the 73 TH-57C models, 20 have been fitted with analog Night Vision Device (NVD) modifications, used to introduce students to aided night flight operations. The GBTS is comprised of six TH-57C full motion simulators, three TH-57B Cockpit Procedure Trainers (CPT), courseware, curricula, and supporting infrastructure to compliment the in flight portion of the training syllabus. Currently, both helicopter and simulator maintenance and logistics support is provided by Department of Defense (DoD) industry partners.<br /><br />The vast majority of flight training within the AHT syllabus is conducted within the guidelines of the Advanced Helicopter Multi-Service Pilot Training System (MPTS) curriculum (CNATRAINST 1542.156B). Current SNAs enter the AHT phase with exit level skills associated with CNATRA's Primary phase of flight training outlined in the MPTS Primary Curriculum (CNATRAINST 1542.140D), or the T-6B Joint Primary Pilot Training (JPPT) (CNATRAINST 1542.166). Students fly a specified number of hours during day, night (NVD aided and unaided), and solo regimes and meet the Course Training Standards (CTS) as outlined in the Advanced Helicopter MPTS. Students must meet minimum requirements set forth in OPNAVINST 3710.7U to earn a standard instrument rating and leave as designated Naval Aviators with the entry level skills required by the Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs). In order to establish a sufficient cadre of qualified instructors, CNATRA additionally trains approximately 70 Instructor Pilots (IP) annually. The IPs are, at a minimum, seasoned second tour aviators that receive additional training at the Helicopter Instructor Training Unit (HITU) which is collocated with the training squadrons at NAS Whiting Field in Milton, FL. The HITU standardizes instructor training using Instructor Under Training (IUT) MPTS (CNATRAINST 1542.91H). IPs also receive upgrade training throughout their tours to further qualify as Contact, Form, and NVG IPs using CNATRAINST 1542.91H.<br /><br />The U.S. Navy recognizes it has used the same training model for decades and is interested in alternative training solutions to produce naval helicopter pilots with commensurate skills and experience at a lower cost.

<a href="mailto:scott.elaine@epa.gov">Contracting Officer</a>
<DESC>As per the Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii)(a), The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on behalf of the National Decontamination Team (NDT) in Erlanger, KY intends to award a sole source purchase order to The Sattelite Center, Inc for the services of sattelite tv services for its facility in Erlanger, KY in the amount of $4,675.00.  The Sattelite Center was the initial successful bidder in 2007 to furnish and install equipment including dishes, receivers, cable, splitters, switches, etc. for standard definition receivers in twelve office locations within the Erlanger facility so the subscription/programming services could be received.  Since that time, NDT has continued to procure annual service.  The Satellite Service, Inc is the only vendor capable of providing such services because the Direct TV satellite service provider locks accounts to the authorized original installer.  DirecTV does this because the primary (original) dealer/installer has the wiring layout and design along with a working knowledge of the installation.  To compete this service would require removal of existing equipment and new installation of equipment and service in the twelve locations within the facility.  This would cause interupted service, significant down time which would render the facility incapable of meeting the Agency's homeland security mission during National Security Events.  This additional expense to the Government is not feasible or is it in the best interest of the Government.  
The National American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is: 517410.  The EPA has only one known source for this procurement that is in the Government's best interest.  
All responses regarding this notice must be received in writing to U.S. EPA, ATTN: Elaine Scott, Contracting Officer, via email at: scott.elaine@epa.gov no later than March 9, 2012 at 12noon EST.  Telephonic requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  The determination not to compete this requirement is at the discretion of the Contracting Officer in accordance with FAR 13.106-1(b)

<DESC>Special Notice Synopsis to Purchase a Laser Based N2O Measurement System
1.	Under SOL-CI-12-00005, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 13.106-1(b) with Horiba Instruments (Horiba) to purchase a Laser Based N20 Measurement System.   A pre-solicitation for this requirement was initially posted to www.fedbizopps.gov on October 18, 2011 and a Sources Sought Synopsis for this requirement was posted on December 27, 2011.  This Special Notice replaces those synopses in their entirety.
2.	a.  Horiba possesses the capability of manufacturing an N2O analyzer capable of highly accurate measurement at sub-ppb concentration levels that can be fully and seamlessly integrated into the existing Horiba MEXA analyzer and test cell host computer architecture that currently exists in chassis dynamometer site D329 at EPA?s National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory.  EPA?s testing of advanced light-duty vehicles specifically requires the ability to accurately measure N2O that can be emitted from these vehicles.  No other vendors sell or manufacture systems using an architecture that can provide the capabilities required by EPA.  Horiba Instruments, Inc. is the only company that can seamlessly integrate Quantum Cascade LaserCL N2O measurement capability in a timely, cost effective manner.  
b.	EPA requires this capability in order to meet deadlines for technology review in support of Green House Gas legislation for light and heavy-duty vehicles.
Under this procurement, the contractor shall provide and install all necessary system plumbing, including heated sample lines, filters, heated and unheated sample probes and overflow calibration devices, and all required transfer tubing, fittings and valves. As installed there must be no contamination in sample plumbing that would be detectable on any range of the analyzer.  The analyzer shall have a purge function that includes back flush of sample lines.  This will be performed with zero-grade nitrogen.
This procurement will be accomplished under the commercial item procedures in FAR Part 12. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified above. This documentation shall establish that the respondent has the ability to meet the requirements identified above, and shall cite specific examples of previous similar work, including client names and contact information.  Documentation must be submitted by March 19, 2012.  Submit your request in writing to Debbie Lewis by fax to 513-487-2107 or by e-mail to lewis.Debbie@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.

The VOSS eliminates the need for Soldiers to dismount from the vehicles, thereby decreasing the risk of serious injury or loss of life. <br><br>It has been determined that LMGS is the only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency's requirements.  The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C 2304 (c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2); Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements.  However, all responsible sources that can provide supporting data to demonstrate they can successfully provide the required non-developmental VOSS spare and repair parts may submit a parts list with a corresponding quote that will considered by the agency.  Responses are to be received via e-mail to within 30 calendar days of the date of this notice.  All requests for further information must be in writing or via email. No telephonic inquiries or requests will be honored.  You may forward responses to the following e-mail address: karen.e.travis4.civ@mail.mil.  Acknowledgement of receipt will be issued.  All offerors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration in accordance with FAR 52.204-7 and DFARS 252.204-7004.  In addition, all offerors must complete the Certifications and Representations as set forth in FAR 52.212-3.  This can be accomplished through the following website: https://orca.bpn.gov.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. <br>

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]<br />(1) Listed End Product<br />Listed End Product: Listed Countries of Origin:<br /><br /><br /><br />(2) Certification.

Interested Parties: An interested party is an actual or prospective bidder or offeror whose direct economic interest would be affected by the award of a contract or by the failure to award a contract.

Private-sector offerors on acquisitions subject to OMB Circular No. A-76 are also not considered interested parties for purposes of filing a HQAMC-level protest.<BR><BR>?	Protest decision authority: The AMC command counsel is designated as the HQAMC protest decision authority. In the absence of command counsel the deputy command counsel is designated.?	Time for filing a protest: A HQAMC protest shall be filed in accordance with the timeframes set out in FAR 33.103(e). HQAMC office hours are 8 AM to 4:30 PM Eastern Standard Time.

Election of forum: After an interested party protests an AMC procurement to HQAMC and while that protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If a protest is filed with an external forum on the same solicitation as the HQAMC-level protest, the HQAMC-level protest will be dismissed.

Processing of HQAMC-level protests: Within 10 working days after the protest is filed, the contracting officer, with the assistance of legal counsel, shall file with the HQAMC Office of Command Counsel (ATTN: AMCCC-PL) one copy of an administrative report in response to the protest. Reports shall be sent by fax, over-night mail or hand-delivered to ensure timely receipt. 
The HQAMC protest decision authority will issue a written decision within 20 working days of the protest filing. The written decision will be binding on AMC and its contracting activities.

Protests after award: When a protest is filed with HQ AMC within 10 calendar days after award, or within five calendar days of debriefing for any debriefing that was requested as required by FAR 15.506, the contracting officer shall suspend performance. 
The HQAMC director of contracting may authorize contract performance, notwithstanding the protest, upon a written finding that contract performance will be in the best interests of the United States; or urgent and compelling circumstances that significantly affect the interests of the United States will not permit waiting for a decision from the HQAMC protest decision authority. 
52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The FDA has a requirement for a Gas Chromatograph-Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (GC-QqQ). With increasing frequency, a Division within the FDA is asked to determine contaminants, adulterants or other extraneous chemical compounds in pharmaceuticals or dietary supplements, or to support pharmacokinetic studies which involve analysis of blood, urine or other physiological fluids. Thus, effective and rugged technology for determining pharmaceutical ingredients and associated compounds at trace levels (parts per trillion) in a variety of matrices is needed. Acquisition of the requested GC-QqQ will significantly improve FDA's ability to respond to these analytical challenges. Please see the attached solicitation.

<DESC>The FDA has a requirement for an electrospray ionization high performance ion mobility-quadrupole mass spectrometer (ESI-HPIMS-QMS) system to be used for rapid quality surveillance testing of pharmaceutical products. Surveillance testing is one important component of the FDA quality drug monitoring program. American consumers may be exposed to pharmaceutical products that have been counterfeited, contaminated, or mislabeled as a result of the globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain and the large availability of drug products sold on the internet. Current USP and laboratory testing methods are often laborious and time consuming to perform. Therefore, FDA seeks an ESI-HPIMS-QMS system for the rapid analysis and characterization of pharmaceutical products. Please see the attached solicitation.

(1)	Describe how the 1 day in 10 year resource adequacy standard is defined and utilized in various jurisdictions across the country;
(2)	Develop case studies resembling existing regional transmission organization (RTO) and independent system operator (ISO) footprints and use a probabilistic simulation model to examine how target reserve margins and total economic and reliability costs change across different interpretations of the 1 day in 10 year standard;
(3)	Use these case studies to examine how these target reserve margins compare to the economically efficient risk neutral and risk-adjusted reserve margins.  
The case studies will include analysis on systems varied by system size, resource mix, loads, import capabilities, demand response, and penetration of intermittent resources.

This project will culminate in the contractor's reports that document the assumptions and key findings of the scope of work summarized above.  

This project will feed directly into the Office of Energy Policy's (OEPI) broader project that is designed to achieve the Commission's strategic goal to promote operational efficiency in wholesale markets through the exploration and encouragement of the use of software and hardware that will optimize market operations.  The research conducted will inform potential future policy reforms designed to most efficiently use the resources available and create incentives for new resources, when appropriate, to ensure reliability.

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Past performance<br />The technical evaluation factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award. <br />Ratings: All technical factors will be rated using an adjectival approach uitilizing the following adjectival ratings: Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Marginal or Unsatisfactory. An Unsatisfactory proposal will not be considered for award. <br />2. PRICE <br />(a) Award, if made, will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the best value to the Government, technical, performance risk, price and other factors considered. In selecting the best overall offer, the Government will consider the value of each offer in terms of the evaluated technical quality offered for the price. The relative quality of offerors will be based upon their ability to meet or exceed the minimum performance requirements of this solicitation resulting in less risk of nonperformance, defective performance, and late performance under the resulting</p>
<p>contract. The quality in technical offers will be compared with differences in the overall price to the Government.<br />(b) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.<br />(c) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal/Quote Revisions.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>The solicitation number for this notice is SP3300-12-Q-5010. This is an unrestricted acquisition for vendors that can provide the required annual maintenance for EMC Storage Area Network servers. The NAICS code is 541519. The size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>This notice incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-55 effective 02 February 2012 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) DPN 20120130 edition and Defense Logistics Acquisition Directive (DLAD) Current to Revision 5 and PROCLTR 2012-21. The complete text of any of the clauses and provisions may be accessed in full text at http://farsite.hill.af.mil.</p>
<p>This procurement is for the purchase of EMC SAN hardware/software maintenance for DLA Distribution Information Operations New Cumberland, PA.</p>
<p>See attached Statement of Work (Attachment 1). The SOW includes a required Bill of Materials.</p>
<p>This is a brand name requirement. Justification to restrict sources is as follows:<br />EMC is the sole manufacturer of the SAN servers which are proprietary in nature. EMC maintains exclusive rights to all products and services. Therefore, maintenance of the brand name servers must be performed by either EMC or an authorized support partner. It is essential that the EMC products utilized to provide for proper maintenance of the systems.</p>
<p>Offerors shall provide the unit price for each component and the total amount, inclusive of shipping costs (FOB Destination). All SAN servers are located at Information Operations at Susquehanna, PA.</p>
<p>Note: The required period of performance for the maintenance is the date of award through October 10, 2012. Prices submitted shall include a reinstatement fee to bring the maintenance current from October 11, 2011 through the date of the award. Estimated date of award is March 28, 2012.</p>
<p>Any award resulting from this solicitation will be issued on a Standard Form (SF) 1449.</p>
<p>The method of payment for supplies under this order is by the Acquisition Operations Office via the Government Purchase Card (VISA).</p>
<p>The following FAR, DFARS, and DLAD clauses and provisions apply to this acquisition. The full text version of these clauses and provisions may be viewed at http://farsite.hill.af.mil/.</p>

Protests filed with the agency should clearly state that they are an "Agency Level Protest under Executive Order No. 12979." (Note: DLA procedures for Agency Level Protests filed under Executive Order No. 12979 allow for a higher level decision on the initial protest than would occur with a protest to the Contracting Officer; this is not an appellate review of a Contracting Officer's decision on a protest previously filed with the Contracting Officer). Absent a clear indication of the intent to file an agency level protest, protests will be presumed to be protests to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>(End of Provision)</p>
<p>DLAD 52.233-9001 DISPUTES: AGREEMENT TO USE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) (JUN 2001)</p>

If unassisted negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties will use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) techniques to try to resolve the dispute. Litigation will only be considered as a last resort when ADR is unsuccessful or has been documented by the party rejecting ADR to be inappropriate for resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(b) Before either party determines ADR inappropriate, that party must discuss the use of ADR with the other party. The documentation rejecting ADR must be signed by an official authorized to bind the contractor (see FAR 52.233-1, or for the agency, by the Contracting Officer, and approved at a level above the Contracting Officer after consultation with the ADR Specialist and with legal counsel (see DLA Directive 5145.1). Contractor personnel are also encouraged to include the ADR Specialist in their discussions with the Contracting Officer before determining ADR to be inappropriate.</p>

52.233-4703	 AMC-LEVEL PROTEST PROGRAM	05/01/2004
If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the General Accounting Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103.  If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

ALL QUESTIONS RECEIVED AFTER THIS DATE AND TIME WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED. All questions submitted within the allotted time will be answered within 24 hours.<BR><BR>Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Apr 2010) (a) (1) The Offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that -- (i) The Offeror and/or any of its Principals -- (A) Are [_] are not [_] presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (B) Have [_] have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property (if offeror checks ?have?, the offeror shall also see 52.209-7, if included in this solicitation); and (C) Are [_] are not [_] presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (a)(1)(i)(B) of this provision; and (D) Have [_], have not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

(1) Federal taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (i) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (ii) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<BR><BR>(2) Examples. (i) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (ii) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (iii) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (iv) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (ii) The Offeror has [[_] has not [_], within a three-year period preceding this offer, had one or more contracts terminated for default by any Federal agency. (2) ?Principal,? for the purposes of this certification, means an officer; director; owner; partner; or a person having primary management or supervisory responsibilities within a business entity (e.g., general manager; plant manager; head of a division or business segment; and similar positions). This Certification Concerns a Matter Within the Jurisdiction of an Agency of the United States and the Making of a False, Fictitious, or Fraudulent Certification May Render the Maker Subject to Prosecution Under Section 1001, Title 18, United States Code. (b) The Offeror shall provide immediate written notice to the Contracting Officer if, at any time prior to contract award, the Offeror learns that its certification was erroneous when submitted or has become erroneous by reason of changed circumstances.<BR><BR>(c) A certification that any of the items in paragraph (a) of this provision exists will not necessarily result in withholding of an award under this solicitation. However, the certification will be considered in connection with a determination of the Offeror?s responsibility. Failure of the Offeror to furnish a certification or provide such additional information as requested by the Contracting Officer may render the Offeror non-responsible. (d) Nothing contained in the foregoing shall be construed to require establishment of a system of records in order to render, in good faith, the certification required by paragraph (a) of this provision. The knowledge and information of an Offeror is not required to exceed that which is normally possessed by a prudent person in the ordinary course of business dealings. (e) The certification in paragraph (a) of this provision is a material representation of fact upon which reliance was placed when making award. If it is later determined that the Offeror knowingly rendered an erroneous certification, in addition to other remedies available to the Government, the Contracting Officer may terminate the contract resulting from this solicitation for default.<BR><BR>

<p>1. Vendor questions and answers:</p>
<p>Question: In regards to the requirements for the Superconducting Magnet (Optional Line Item 0006), normally the length is not specified, does the specification mean there is 10" available between the bottom of the mixing chamber flange to the center of the field or does it actually mean the field of 8 Tesla has to extend over 10" of length?</p>
<p>Answer: NIST does not mean that the field of 8 T has to extend over 10"; NIST means that there is 10" available between the bottom of the mixing chamber (MC) flange and the bottom of the vacuum can or radiation shield. The field center should be within this the middle 4" of this 10" length (ie, there should be at least 3" clearance between field center and MC bottom, at least 3" clearance between field center and vacuum can/radiation shield.</p>
<p>2. Relevant Past Performance:</p>
<p>FROM:<br />Relevant past performance would include a dilution refrigerator (0.02 K base temperature) that is cryogen free. Past performance for a general cryogenic system at 0.3 or 1.0 K that requires cryogens would not be considered relevant.</p>
<p>TO:<br />Relevant past performance would include a dilution refrigerator (0.03 K base temperature) that is cryogen free. Past performance for a general cryogenic system at 0.3 or 1.0 K or that requires cryogens would not be considered relevant.</p>

<p>Proposals submitted against this request shall consist of three separate parts as follows:</p>
<p>a) The first part shall be the price proposal. <br />The SBA anticipates committing approximately $150 million in leverage prior to 2012 fiscal year end (September 30, 2012) under the initial solicitation for Early Stage SBICs. However, SBICs approved under the initial solicitation may request leverage in excess of such amount; if so, the additional amounts requested by such applicants may be committed in subsequent fiscal years. SBA contemplates between three and eight funds will be approved under the initial solicitation although significantly more may apply. Each approved fund is expected to have between two and three principals. SBA estimates up to 50 principals may need to be reviewed under the initial solicitation. Each offeror should submit a minimum total price based upon the parameters included above. Additionally, each offeror should submit a pre manager price in the event the government elects to add additional managers or seeks to reduce the number of managers if the quoted minimum exceeds budgetary constraints. There is no page limitation on this part.</p>
<p>Each offeror shall submit a travel estimate. SBA anticipates between two and four visits to SBA at its Washington headquarters. One visit may extend for a total of three days; other trips are not expected to require more than one day. Travel estimates must comply with the Federal Travel Regulation, 41 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) chapters 300-304, and, to the extent applicable, SBA Standard Operating Procedure 20 11 5B.</p>
<p>Pricing Sheet - Supplies or Services and Prices/Costs with line item prices inserted by the offeror. Please refer to the "Pricing Sheet" attached.</p>
<p>Completed and signed Representations, Certifications and Other Statements of Offerors shall be included with the price proposal (FAR 52.212-3 - Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items). Also complete and include FAR 52.209-7 entitled, "Information Regarding Responsibility Matters" found within the body of this announcement.</p>
<p>b) The second part of the proposal shall address the technical approach. <br />This part shall address the Contractor's ability to analyze the capability of fund managers to successfully invest in early stage companies, primarily in the form of equity securities. The contractor shall demonstrate an understanding of how fund managers source potential investments, perform due diligence on such potential investments, structure and price the investment, add value to the businesses invested in, and plan for and execute an exit from the investment. The contractor's experience should have been obtained by investing directly in funds with a strategy similar to that envisioned by the Early Stage SBIC program or by advising investors making investments in such funds. This part shall be limited to 25 pages and should include the following elements:</p>
<p>i) Technical Approach<br />Under the Early Stage SBIC program, the Agency will be selecting management teams to operate as Early Stage SBICs. These SBICs will focus on investing (primarily equity) in early stage companies. The selected contractor will assist the Agency in evaluating the potential applicants for the program. This evaluation will focus on the skills and experiences of the proposed SBIC managers to determine if they can successfully invest in early stage companies. The selected contractor will review the previous experience (especially track record of the managers), the proposed strategy of the management team and conduct appropriate due diligence on the applicant(s). Based on this evaluation the selected contractor will provide recommendations to the Agency as to the qualifications of the applicant. In order to perform this analysis, the selected contractor will have had to have prior experience in either (1) making such investments directly into small businesses or into funds that make such investments or (2) having evaluated such an investment strategy on behalf of potential investors into a fund that would make early stage investments. <br />It is likely that the time frame for evaluating potential applicants will be compressed, perhaps as little as 30-45 days from submission of the applications. The contractor must be able to assign qualified staff sufficient to meet this deadline. The contractor needs to address the methodology it will use in evaluating the skill set and experiences of prospective applicants. It should demonstrate how the methodology allows it to determine that potential applicants will possess the skills necessary to be successful in the Early Stage SBIC program. Specifically, the contractor should explain how its methodology addresses the areas contained in the Investment Memorandum attached to the Statement of Work. The contractor should directly relate prior experience it possesses to the analysis required to be performed herein. <br />ii) Key Personnel <br />The contractor must supply resumes of the individuals performing the analysis required under this contract. The resumes must detail the specific type and amount of work experience held by the key individuals who will be involved in this project and how such experience relates to the duties required under this contract. The proposed individuals must have the specific experience and must provide the actual analysis; they cannot function in solely an oversight role. The expectation is that the primary individual(s) responsible for the analysis will have a minimum of five years of directly analogous experience although supporting professional individuals may have less. Nonetheless, all individuals performing the analysis contemplated by this contract must have directly analogous experience. <br />iii) Organizational Experience/Ability to Perform<br />The contractor must demonstrate that it has the infrastructure to satisfactorily perform and support the analysis contemplated by this contract. This will include the ability to supply the administrative services necessary to support the contract. The contractor must address whether performance of the duties required herein will be compromised by its existing business needs. <br />c) The third part shall address past performance.<br />Contractor shall address past performance gained over a minimum of the past five years that demonstrates experience outlined in b) above. The contractor should have the experience directly or have assigned staff that has the direct experience for the requisite number of years. There is no page limitation on this part. A minimum of three reference packages entitled "PAST PERFORMANCE QUESTIONAIRE" found behind this solicitation must be submitted. The offeror is responsible for submitting Part I of the package but is also responsible for coordinating with their chosen references to ensure a full package is received by the SBA consisting of all six pages for each reference.</p>
<p>Six paper sets of the proposal, an original so marked and five copies are required. Submissions must be submitted in hard copy form.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s). <br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of provision)<br />Evaluation of Proposals<br />A. Initial Evaluation of Proposals</p>
<p>An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth in the Evaluation Criteria stated below, and all offers received will be evaluated in accordance with the established evaluation plan. The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussion based solely upon initial proposals. Therefore, offerors should ensure that their initial proposal constitutes their best offer in terms of both price and the technical solution being proposed. If required, the Contracting Officer may establish a competitive range comprised of the technically acceptable proposals. If the Contracting Officer determines that the number of proposals that would otherwise be in the competitive range exceeds the number at which an efficient competition can be conducted, the Contracting Officer may limit the number of proposals in the competitive range to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition amount the most highly rated proposals. Only those offerors in the competitive range will be offered an opportunity to participate further in the procurement.</p>
<p>B. Discussion/Final Proposal Revisions (if appropriate/necessary)</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer will engage in discussions with all offerors in the competitive range in accordance with FAR 15.306. At the conclusion of the discussions, a final common cut-off date which allows a reasonable opportunity for submission of written final proposal revisions will be established. Those offerors selected to remain in the competitive range will be notified to submit Final Proposal Revisions.</p>
<p>C. Final Evaluation of Offers (if appropriate)</p>
<p>A final proposal evaluation will be performed after receipt of Final Proposal Revision</p>
<p>Technical Approach<br />Under the Early Stage SBIC program, the Agency will be selecting management teams to operate as Early Stage SBICs. These SBICs will focus on investing (primarily equity) in early stage companies. The selected contractor will assist the Agency in evaluating the potential applicants for the program. This evaluation will focus on the skills and experiences of the proposed SBIC managers to determine if they can successful invest in early stage companies. The selected contractor will review the previous experience (especially track record of the managers), the proposed strategy of the management team and conduct appropriate due diligence on the applicant(s). Based on this evaluation the selected contractor will provide recommendations to the Agency as to the qualifications of the applicant. In order to perform this analysis, the selected contractor will have had to have prior experience in either (1) making such investments directly into small businesses or into funds that make such investments or (2) having evaluated such an investment strategy on behalf of potential investors into a fund that would make early stage investments. The contractor must specifically identify how its methodology determines that a prospective applicant meets (or fails to meet) the criteria contained in the Investment Memorandum attached to the Statement of Work. <br />It is likely that the time frame for evaluating potential applicants will be compressed, perhaps as little as 30-45 days from submission of the applications. The contractor must be able to assign qualified staff sufficient to meet this deadline. <br /><br />Key Personnel <br />The ability of the contractor to perform under this proposal is directly related to the skills and quality of the personnel assigned to the project. Failure of the assigned personnel to have directly analogous experience will be a disqualifying characteristic. The contractor must supply resumes of the individuals performing the analysis required under this contract. The resumes must detail the specific type and amount of work experience held by the key individuals who will be involved in this project and how such experience relates to the duties required under this contract. The proposed individuals must have the specific experience and must provide the actual analysis; they cannot function in solely an oversight role. The expectation is that the primary individual(s) responsible for the analysis will have a minimum of five years of directly analogous experience although supporting professional individuals may have less. Nonetheless, all individuals performing the analysis contemplated by this contract must have directly analogous experience.</p>
<p>Organizational Experience/Ability to Perform<br />The contractor must demonstrate that it has the infrastructure to satisfactorily perform and support the analysis contemplated by this contract. This will include the ability to supply the administrative services necessary to support the contract and that performance under this contract will not be compromised by its existing business.</p>
<p>Past Performance <br />Evaluation of this factor will be based upon references provided by the contractor. These references will be contacted. The Government may also consider other information available, including personal knowledge. The dates of the prior performance and the relevance of the work performed will be considered. Performance information will be used to assure best value to the Government. The Government will focus on information that demonstrates quality of performance relative to the size and complexity of the procurement under consideration. Performance by the offeror and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to project requirements, including the quality of services and products, effectiveness of cost management/control, timeliness of performance, and customer satisfaction will be evaluated. References other than those identified by the offeror may be contacted by the Government with the information received and used in the evaluation of the offeror's past performance.</p>
<p>Price<br />The contractor will be selected upon a determination by the Agency that it is the best qualified to perform the analysis contemplated under the contract and that also meets the pricing constraints of the Agency. <br />Before the offeror's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer) whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis IAW FAR 13.106 with FedMedical, Inc., 301 Oakbrook Lane, Ste 395, Summerville, SC 29485.  FedMedical Inc. is the only responsible source that can provide (16) FMI-301CNX shipboard ceiling mounted lights to be used in various Battle Dressing Stations, Pre-Operatory and Trauma spaces outside of the Main Operating Rooms on a U.S. Navy combatant ship.  The choice of any other manufacturer would result in a breakdown of that interoperability between fleet and reduce the lifesaving capability of each of the ships.

This acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the 13.106 only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.
 There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North America Industry Classification System (NAICS) 423450 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, including cost, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same product. All capability statements received by the closing date of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Along with the capabilities statement vendors must also confirm that the single head ceiling mounted lights along with the installation kit meet the shock test standards set forth in MIL-S-901D (IAW FAR 11.2 available for download at https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/).
  Specifically, the vendor shall provide a Certificate from an approved independent test activity verifying and specifically stating on the Certificate from the approved test activity, that the lights meet category MIL-S-901D, Grade A, Class I or Class II, Type A testing.  Any and all lights being proposed as primary or alternate proposals shall pass MIL-S-901D testing independently of others offered.
A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Jaime Belletto, jaime.belletto@med.navy.mil by  4 PM EST on March 20, 2012.
 No phone calls accepted.

<p>Response to NSW Recruiting Directorate Diversity Awareness and Mentoring Support Services</p>
<p>Solicitation Number:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>H92240-12-I-RD01<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Date: 3-4-2012</p>
<p>Questions</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Synopsis Questions:</strong></p>
<p>6.2. b:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Experience - You indicate a minimum of three but no more than 5 similar jobs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are these training? Recruiting? Are they limited to military or will civilian experience count? Why 3 as opposed to 1, 2 or 5 ?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We are interested in determining if a potential bidder has been able to succeed at similar efforts over time; hence the 3 - 5 request. Military and civilian experiences in promoting awareness and education services to diverse populations will count. The emphasis needs to be on jobs/contracts that demonstrate contractor performance in providing similar awareness and education services to similar populations. All completed/in-progress contracts or jobs submitted by a potential contractor will be considered. If a contractor has only 1 experience job to submit, this could be viewed as less-favorable to a potential bidder who can show a greater depth of performance.</strong></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Performance Work Statement Questions:</strong></p>
<p style="TEXT-INDENT: 0in; MARGIN-LEFT: 0in; mso-add-space: auto; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri"><span>&bull;1.)<span style="FONT: 7pt 'Times New Roman'">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>2.1.1:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You indicate the need for "detailed resume of all staff personnel, sub-Contractors and consultants", what is the anticipated timing for this information?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason for the question is that given the broad nature of the overall request, some personnel may not as yet be identified for specific locations as well as mentorship responsibilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would it be easier for specific criteria to be established for those targeted personnel (in terms of acceptable background, certifications etc.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>with the government having final approval over proposed personnel for certain functions such as: Swim Instructor, Mentor etc..?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We expect the potential contractor to assemble a team of experts who will be able to perform the statement of work. By stating their individual qualifications in any bid proposal, the Government will be able to evaluate their potential to successfully perform to the statement of work. One criterion for selection will be the strength of this team. The Government will work with the prime contractor who will be responsible for managing the sub-contractors. Sub-contractor performance is the responsibility of the prime contractor who would be advised by the Government in the event of any unsatisfactory performance by a sub-contractor.</strong></p>
<p>2.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2.1.2:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Given the fixed price nature of the proposed contract what is the purpose of asking for an itemized cost for attending, managing or monitoring each individual event?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When it seems that<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the emphasis is on flexibility asked of the contractor, reiterated in 2.1.3.7.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is the government reserving the right to disapprove an event?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If so, would that tend to make each event a negotiated item with negotiated targeted results?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Particularly since the inference seems to be that that flexibility regarding events scheduled is needed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Has there been any thought as to how an event cancelled by an organization would affect pricing and potentially overall contract performance?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer: The Government is required to offer this as a fixed-price contract. Individual event itemizations could allow for negotiation of the total fixed price before the final award if overall budget considerations dictate. For example: if removing a regional campaign and/or a few proposed events will bring the cost to within the Government budget, this could be worked out with the selected bidder before the contract is signed. Additionally, the flexibility of the potential contractor to shift events and/or efforts during the period of performance is considered important in the awareness and education campaign.</strong></p>
<p>3.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2.1.3:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is/Would the government consider a multiple contract award based on regions?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The thought being that this may reduce the price to the government when considering pricing and the ability of regionally situated firms to concentrate resources and past relationships while minimizing travel etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This seems to enhance a firm's abilities as it relates to 2.1.3.7 in terms of Regional Campaign Elements or in 2.1.3.7 is it the government's intent to "weight" the contractor's response strictly by their approach and experience regionally?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer: This is intended to be one contract where efficiency and cost-savings are anticipated by a common overhead. In this RFI, the potential bidder can propose alternate regions and/or events which they believe are more cost-effective. These inputs will be considered before any final RFP is published.</strong></p>
<p>4.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2.1.3.3 Would the government consider adding the Philadelphia, PA metropolitan area to North Eastern Region? We noticed that Philadelphia Metropolitan area (includes Philadelphia PA, Trenton NJ, Camden NJ, Wilmington and Newark DE) was not identified as a region, though only 2 hrs. from NY or Baltimore and with multiple possibilities and locations for pool time and former Navy and Civilian personnel in the area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition it has a substantial African American and Hispanic population with a significant base of Asian and African immigrant populations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Philadelphia is also the countries 7<sup>th</sup> largest metropolitan area according to the census bureau,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>as well as having three of the countries oldest HBCU's all with active NCAA athletic programs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer: This is an RFI. The Government is interested in any argument that can be made for new/alternate regions.</strong></p>
<p>5.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2.1.4 Education of HPCs:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would the government consider additional locations for the formal Education of High Potential Candidates component as opposed to item 2.1.4.2?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer: Yes.</strong></p>
<p>6.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2.2.1.2 Criterion 2:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is there empirical data validating the minimum standard requested that would substantiate this goal (100/region) as being reasonable considering the target age group?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer: This is a target goal considered reasonable for this effort. The potential bidder must consider what it would cost to achieve this and other specified goals when submitting for the RFP. For this RFI, we are interested in what potential bidders see as a level of effort anticipated to meet this and other goals.</strong></p>
<p>7.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2.2.1.3 Criterion 3:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Is there empirical data validating the minimum standard requested that would substantiate this goal (100/region) as being reasonable, considering the dual request of not only signing up for the initial information form but also completing the additional follow-up information?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, would not "target market minority males" who may be between age 25 and the cut off age date for BUD's admission also be counted in this number if identified through the contractor's efforts?</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Answer: This contract is designed to focus on awareness to "defined" high potential candidates from diverse backgrounds for the Navy SEALs. This "high potential candidate", as defined in section 1.1.5 of the solicitation, is the candidate our research suggests is most likely to succeed in training. It is important that awareness events reach out to these men first. The contractor will be evaluated on the ability to meet those goals stated. There is no intention to exclude anyone from participating in any contract events or campaigns conducted under this contract. But, the value of this contract is the ability to reach out to the high potential candidates from diverse backgrounds in the interest of improving the percentages of men from these backgrounds who could become Navy SEALs. The potential contractor must keep this in mind when performing under this contract.</strong></p>

Questions and Answers:
Q:  What are the limits of Subcontracting for small businesses? 
A:  FAR Clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting.  Services: (except Construction), at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.
Q:  Is a Florida or Puerto Rico License required?
A:  Yes, a copy must be submitted with the SF330 Package.  Architectual firm shall be licenced and located in the State of Florida and or the Comunwealth of Puerto Rico or both, depending on which Region applying for.
Q:  In the recently released solicitation notices for A/E support for VISN 8 in the North and South Regions, Item 8 of this notice indicates that independent and separate contracts for each of the following specialties to be awarded?
(1) one Contract for Fire Protection Engineer;
(1) one Contract for Professional Cost Estimator, and
(1) one Contract for Commissioning Engineer.
A: Firms with highly qualified staff in all of these disciplines may be considered for a single award of all three disciplines.  However, individual contracts for each of these 3 disciplines may be awarded.
Q: Will these be three separate contracts for each discipline in each Region?
A:  The intent is yes.  But there may be one contract awarded for the three disciplines.   There are many factors affecting the award decision. i.e. Experience, qualifications or socioeconomic status, availability of contractors for both the North and South Regions and the elimination of potential conflict of interest.
Q:  We are considering submitting for the commissioning portion separately, but will probably be teaming with architectural teams to pursue the IDIQ Multiple Awards contracts.  If we were awarded a commissioning contract as well as being selected on a team for the A/E services, how might that be a problem, or would it be an issue at all?
A:  That will present a conflict of interest issue; particularly, if you provide Commissioning, Fire Protection or Cost Estimating services as part of an A&E team.  You therefore, cannot validate your own work, under the independent contract.  For now you may apply for both.  I expect there may be sufficient participants in a project of this magnitude.  Therefore, selection will be made to participants who were not selected as part of an architectural team, but may have also applied for the independent disciplines.
Q:  Could the Cost Estimator and or the Fire Protection reviews/validation be accomplished electronically?
A:  Yes.
Q:  What criteria will be used for selection?
A:  SF330's, qualifications, specialized hospital experience, types of projects, complexity, estimating abilities, capabilities, design accuracy, timeliness,  location, available resources, past performance, accuracy of the work performed and litigation.  In short, any favorable trait the customer would want in a contractor for repeat business.  This evaluation is subjective based on how the information is presented and the interpretation of the evaluation team.
Q:  Is the intent to have several SDVOSB/VOSB/8a disciplines submit (individually as firms) and then choose companies that "collectively" can fulfill all of the services required for the IDIQ?
A:  The intent is to have several SDVOSB/VOSB/8a firms submit individually, and then select highly qualified companies that "collectively" can fulfill all of the services required for the IDIQ. i.e. Each team, should at least, have of the following licensed/registered specialty disciplines be members of the firm, or team, with demonstrable expertise in their respective fields: Architectural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Structural, Envionmental, Cost Estimatin, Commissioning, Fire Protection, etc.
Q:  What is the small business criteria and how is it determined?
A:  The size standards rules are the same for all. Visit www.sba.gov.  Each procurement use a 6 digit code representing the commodity or service being procured. i.e. 541310 is the North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) code representing Architectural & Engineering Services, small business standard $4.5 million.   To be considered a small business, in any category, the average annual gross receipts cannot exceed, the value assigned buy SBA of any NAICS code, over the last 3 years.  Hence, $4.5 million for this code.
Q:  A "partial set aside with preference for SDVOSB, VOSB, 8a and Hub zone firms.  Will firms who do not fall in any of those categories be allowed to summit SF330's?    
A: Yes, but see Para 3 of the solicitation announcement.  
"	This means that out of the 10 estimated Architectural awards, we set aside 6 contracts for small business, for each region.   
"	If insufficient qualified firms are not identified during the SF330 evaluation process, we may award to large businesses.  
"	Conversely, if sufficient qualified small businesses are identified, then we reserve the right to award all contracts to small businesses.
"	Unlike the traditional cascading procurements, this procurement will evaluate all participants IAW the Brooks Act, before making an award decision.

<DESC>Project Scope: This is a design-bid-build project. The Qualification Training Range (QTR) is used to train and test soldiers on the skills necessary to detect, identify, engage and defeat stationary and moving infantry targets in a tactical array with their prescribed weapons. In order to centralize training and reduce land, maintenance, and unit overhead requirements, this range combines the capabilities of the Modified Record Fire Range, Automated Sniper Field Fire Range, Combat Pistol/Military Police Firearms Qualification Course and Multipurpose Machine Gun Range. This range supports night fire operations.<br /><br />The range has 16 lanes, each 30 meters wide. These lanes are used for Rifle Qualification, Sniper Field Fire, Machine Gun and Mk 19 fire. Located between the 16 lanes are 15 lanes of CP/MPQC.<br /><br />The firing points for the CPQC are online with the 16 fighting positions of the rifle/machine gun lanes; however the first firing point for the MPQC is 8 meters behind the CPQC firing point. <br /><br />The range supports the following ammunitions: 5.56mm, 7.62mm, 9mm, 40mm and .50 cal. Primary downrange features include the following:<br /><br />315 Stationary Infantry Targets (SITs) <br />24 SIT emplacements with 2 target arms each (500m, 700m) <br />26 Widened SITs <br />20 Stationary Armor Targets (SATs) <br />20 Moving Infantry Targets (MITs) <br />20 Battle Effects Simulators (BES) <br />16 One-man foxholes with prone position <br />10 Two-man foxholes <br />4 Vehicle Firing Positions <br /><br />The Primary facilities are listed below:<br />Automated Training Range (1 EA) <br />Range Operations and Control Area (1 EA) <br />Range Control Tower (290 SF) <br />Ops. / Storage Building (800 SF) <br />Classroom Building (800 SF) <br />Vaulted Latrine (330 SF) <br />Covered Mess (800 SF) <br />Ammo Breakdown Building (185 SF) <br />Bleacher Enclosure (726 SF) <br /><br />The location of this work is on Fort Irwin, San Bernardino County, California.<br />The estimated magnitude of construction is $10,000,000 - $25,000,000.<br /><br />Estimated duration of project is 730 calendar days. <br /><br />This Procurement will be conducted under FSC CODE: Y1DA, NAICS Code: 236220. The size standard for this code is $33,500,000. <br /><br />The acquisition will be conducted under a competitively negotiated source selection. Both a technical proposal and a price proposal will be required. The acquisition strategy is Best Value "Tradeoff." This process allows for a trade-off between non-cost factors and cost/price and allows the Government to accept other than the lowest priced proposal or other than the highest technically rated proposal to achieve a best-value contract award. In making the tradeoff determination all evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are approximately equal to cost or price. It is the Government's intent to award based on initial offers without discussions. Evaluation factors may consist of the following: Construction Experience; Past Performance on projects similar in nature; Key Personnel; Project Management Plan and Small Business Participation Plan. The aforementioned evaluation factors may not be all inclusive.<br /><br />All offerors are advised that this project may be delayed, cancelled or revised at any time during the solicitation, selection, evaluation, negotiation and/or final award process.<br /><br />Downloading the Solicitation: The solicitation will be available on or about 13 February 2012. Plans and specifications will not be provided in hard paper copy. The solicitation and all amendments for this Request for Proposals will be posted on www.fbo.gov Viewing/downloading documents from fbo.go will require prior registration in Central Contractor Registration (www.ccr.gov). Please note that ALL firms who want to access the solicitation, both prospective primes and subcontractors, must be CCR-registered, have a MPIN, and either a DUNS number or CAGE code. <br /><br />Sub-contracting plans are required for all construction contracts awarded to a large business when the award amount exceeds $1,000,000.00. If the offeror is a large business, the firm will be required to submit a sub-contracting plan as part of their proposal package. The plan shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.219-8 and 52.219-9 and AFARS 19.705. Failure to submit an acceptable sub-contracting plan may make the offeror ineligible for award of the contact. To be acceptable, the plan must adequately address the six required statutory elements and provide sufficient information to enable the Contracting Officer to answer affirmatively questions A through H of appendix DD, Part 2, AFARS 5119.705.

<AWARDEE>H&H MARINE SERVICES (135850126) <br> 95 GRACELAND CIR<br> VICKSBURG, MS 39180-8203
<DESC>Contractor to remove the starboard generator of the CHOCTAWHATCHEE (a floating crane), and replace it with a remanufactured CAT 3306B marine generator or a newly remanufactured Caterpillar generator set of equivalent power within the following range: Caterpillar Generator Set 3306B (170 ekW 213kVa 60Hz @1800 rpm) - (190 ekW 238 kVa 60 Hz @1800 rpm). General characteristics of the crane are: Length - 165'; Beam - 50', molded depth amidships -11'-6"; and displacement -1,221 long tons. Due to the current sound and weatherproof enclosures an identical model remanufactured unit is desired and any other model offered must fit inside the existing enclosures and utilize the existing radiators and mounting arrangement. A Caterpillar remanufactured unit is required to provide interoperability and sharing of common parts and consumables (filters, belts, seals, oils, etc) with the remaining 3306B generator set on board the CHOCTAWHATCHEE. With a remanufactured 3306B generator set the fuel delivery system, which includes the injection pump, injectors and governor, must be new parts. The contractor will reuse the existing radiator but will have the unit flushed and cleaned per the manufacturer's recommendations. The contractor will remove and re-install the generator's enclosure and all covers. Lifting and setting of the enclosure will be made by the Government with a Government crane with proper coordination with the contractor. <br><br>The contractor will disconnect and re-connect all wiring, fuel lines, etc. and insure that the replacement generator is fully operational. The crane barge will be operational during this work, therefore the contractor must ensure that the starboard generator is completely disconnected from the barge's main electrical bus to avoid any accidental re-energizing of the work area until the starboard generator is ready for reconnection and testing. The contractor will insure that the port generator remains operational at all times during the work. The contractor will perform a load test on the remanufactured or new generator set to ensure it will operate without any detrimental effects to the generator or barge. <br>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS

Justification and Approval
Under 
Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) 
For Restricting Competition under FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) "Single Source"


1.	Contracting Activity: Department of Veterans Affairs, Network Contracting Office (NCO) 20, 8115 NE 82nd Ave. Vancouver WA. This requirement will be procured for the Boise VA Medical Center. The Contract Specialist for this procurement is Philip Cyphers.  

2.	Nature and/or Description of the Action Being Processed: The Department of Veterans Affairs proposes to enter into a contract on the basis of other than full and open competition for the purchase of repairs of a General Electric CT Scanner. The requirement will consist of a Hemit HV Tank, miscellaneous repair parts, and installation service. This is a new procurement and the contract contemplated will be firm fixed price to General Electric Medical Systems. This is an emergency requirement.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services Required to Meet the Agency's Needs: The procurement VA531-C22046 is for an emergency repair of a General Electric CT scanner, which will consist of the purchase of Hemit HV Tank, miscellaneous repair parts, installation service and shipping. The installation will consist of multiple hours of labor, overtime labor and travel time. This has already been awarded because it was a urgent and compelling requirement therefore add the actual award amount $28,880.00 not the estimated value.  

4.	Statutory Authority Permitting Restriction in Competition:  The statutory authority for restricting competition under SAP, or Single Sourcing, for acquisitions under $150,000 or Simplified Acquisition Threshold (SAT) is 41 U.S.C. 253(c), as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1). 

IAW FAR 6.302-2(b)(2) delay in award of this contract would result in additional cost to the government. One reason for the additional cost is without a working CT scanner the Boise medical center would need to be send patients to another medical facility. By sending patients to another facility a higher rate at fee basis would need to be paid for patient CT scans. Also, in many cases, transportation and beneficiary travel cost would be incurred in order to obtain CT scans from another medical facility. The specific reason for restricting competition is the urgent and compelling nature of this procurement.  

5.	Demonstration that the Contractor's Unique Qualifications or Nature of the Acquisition Requires the Use of the Authority Cited Above (applicability of authority): This request is urgent and compelling. Because we have an existing In-House Assist Service Agreement in place, with the vendor, we are able to obtain Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) parts at a 15 percent discounted rate and parts are in stock which is transported by the field repair technician. Vendor selected is the OEM for the equipment being repaired. Parts/Service is required urgently to maintain continuity of patient care, delivery time which is essential to patient care.  

6.	Description of Efforts Made to Ensure that Offers are Solicited from As Many Potential Sources as Deemed Practicable IAW FAR 13.104:  Not Applicable: GE OEM CT Scanner parts are only available from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). Use of non-OEM repair parts would conflict with VA260-P-0742 Maintenance Contract (covering services) and might damage critical and expensive components and result in vastly increased repair parts, for which GE could not be held responsible to rectify.
 

7.	Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable - IAW  FAR 13.106-3:  The repair part cost is determined to be fair and reasonable. Part offered at best customer catalogue price. Also, IAW the terms and conditions of VA contract VA260-P-0742, the VA acquires all service parts at a 15 percent discount off this pricing. IAW FAR 13.106-3(a)(2)(ii), the quote is also considered fair and reasonable in comparison to past procurement of similar orders VA260-12-P-0471 and 531-C14335. In addition, the anticipated total cost of the repair to the CT Scanner is $28,880.00 and the acquisition cost of the CT scanner is $1,018,981.00. The percentage of repair cost compared with the CT scanner equipment cost is 2.8 percent. Therefore, IAW FAR 13.106-3(2)(vii) this comparison is the reasonable basis in which the repair cost is considered fair and reasonable.

8.	Description of the Market Research Conducted and the Results, or Statement of Reasons Market Research was not Conducted (FAR 10):  FAR Part 10 directs that market research be conducted on each acquisition appropriate to the circumstances. Market research was conducted for this procurement and mandatory sources were queried in order of priority, see market research in the briefcase. Research results serve to confirm, due to the urgent and compelling nature of this procurement, that GE Medical Systems is the necessary choice. 

9.	Any Other Facts Supporting the Restriction of Competition:  No other facts to report.

10.	Listing of Sources that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition:  No attempts were made to obtain competition therefore no other contractors were able to express interest.

11.	Statement of Actions, if any, the Agency May Take to Remove or Overcome any Barriers to Competition before Making Subsequent Acquisitions for the Supplies or Services Required:  Market research is still ongoing for an alternate vendor who has been trained properly on CT scanner equipment, be able to provide needed GE repair parts and have a reasonable travel and labor cost. At this point no suitable alternatives have been found.  NCO 20 is currently working towards creating a contractual instrument that will facilitate time effective emergency repairs for specialty medical equipment for all stations within NCO 20.  This agreement will be arrived at on a competitive basis.  

 
12.	 Requirements Certification - IAW FAR 6.303-2(c):

I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
