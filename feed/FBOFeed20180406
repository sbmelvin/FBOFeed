<DESC><p>The U.S. Government Publishing Office, (GPO), is the Federal Government's primary centralized resource for gathering, cataloging, producing, providing, and preserving published U.S. Government information in all its forms. Since its inception, under the authority of Title 44 of the U.S. Code, GPO has provided all three branches of the federal government with a set of centralized services that enables them to efficiently and cost effectively produce both printed and electronic documents. GPO has offered these publications for sale to the public and made them widely available for no fee public access through the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP). The FDLP has served the purpose of providing permanent public access to government publications.<br />This requirement supports GPO's Federal Digital System (FDsys) program. FDsys is a COTS-based enterprise content management system, with integration customizations to fully meet its requirements. The major COTS products that have been selected for FDsys include EMC's Documentum and an Enterprise Search tool from FAST Search and Transfer (FAST ESP) which are the foundational piece of the content repository. In addition, there are other tools and technologies that are being used to support FDsys. This includes, but is not limited to the use of JAVA for development, Caliber RM for requirements management, the use of Oracle Databases, the use of Mercury for testing, the use of RoboHelp for training, and a host of other COTS tools.</p>
<p>GPO intends to award a contract in support of FDsys for the ongoing design, development and enhancement of the search experience, specific to Microsoft/FAST (FAST ESP's) enterprise search tool, for GPO's Federal Digital System (FDsys). The procurement is aimed at providing for continuity for overall search experience in order to support ongoing FDsys development.</p>
<p>The proposed contract is expected to be a base one (1) year with four (4) one year options.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code contemplated for this requirement is 541512 (Computer System Design Services).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This project is open to all qualified, responsive, and responsible firms. After solicitation issuance, contractors may view and/or download the solicitation and all amendments at the FedBizOpps website found at https://www.fbo.gov/.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; <br /><br />You must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) Database to receive a Government contract award.&nbsp; <br /><br />DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS SYNOPSIS - PLEASE WATCH FOR THE SOLICITATION</span></p>

A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<p>The Government intends to purchase a Symbosis Pico UHPLC needed by the Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS).

The Symbosis Pico UHPLC is the only integrated on-line SPE/UHPLC system that can clean-up, preconcentrate and process untreated samples fully automated. It is the only commercial system that has the capability of automatically exchange the SPE cartridges. The exchange of cartridges is needed to ensure carry over does not cause invalid analytical results because of the complexity of the biological samples.</p>
<p>Only Spark Holland specially makes these Symbosis Pico UHPLC upon demand to exact specifications. This equipment is compatible with our current system and method. This system will help DLS meet their requirement by fulfilling our NHANES commitments faster as well as other study requests in support of the CDC's biomonitoring laboratory measurement activities on exposure and possible health effects.</p>

<SUBJECT>NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE: Low-Light, Low-Noise Spectrometer
<SOLNBR>1333ND18QNB680012
<RESPDATE>042018
<CONTACT>Tracy M Bisson, Phone 3019758448, Email tracy.bisson@nist.gov
<DESC>The United States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division (AMD) intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Roper Scientifics, Inc (Princeton Instruments), 3660 Quakerbridge Rd, Trenton, NJ, 08619-1208 for the purchase of a low-light, low-noise spectrometer system for NIST's Quantum Measurement Division (QMD). The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is FAR 13.106-1(b) by the authority of FAR Part 13.5 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.
<p>NIST requires a low-light, low-noise spectrometer system for conducting frequency domain measurements in association with quantum optics experiments. The mission of the Quantum Optics Group of the Quantum Measurement Division is to develop and characterize measurement methods that take advantage of the quantum nature of light so as to achieve better performance, uncertainties, or to enable new applications that are not possible with classical methods. Typically, these measurements are of single quantum states, and thus are done in very low-light environments. Therefore, one of the most important aspects of the research is the measurement of this light via a spectrometer. To meet these mission needs the low-light, low-noise spectrometer system will be used in this device, and/or parts of this device to spatially and spectrally image the output of single photon sources that occur in a broad range of processes, including biological systems.</p>
<p>Roper Scientifics, Inc (Princeton Instruments), is the sole source Contractor for this product.  The reason is they are the only company that can provide an accurate and precise spectral characterization, while being compatible with extremely weak classical and quantum light sources in a broad range of optical and near-IR wavelengths. In order to meet these needs the system must be compatible with weak signal sources, the spectrometer should have low insertion loss, and the camera(s) that comprise the said system should be both highly efficient and low noise. Because the cameras comprising this system are unique, it is required for them to be versatile and allow standalone imaging operation. To ensure turnkey operation, the entire system (that is, the monochromator and cameras) should be calibrated and operated by one software suite. Specifically, the system must provide provides cameras to operate from 350 nm to 1700 nm and a compatible software system. Roper Scientifics, Inc (Princeton Instruments) does not provide this system through any of their resellers, so there is only one responsible vendor.</p>
<p>Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractor's commercial schedule.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516 and the size standard is 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, all responsible sources interested may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement. The Government will consider responses received by 1:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on April 20, 2018.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to tracy.bisson@nist.gov .  No telephone requests will be honored.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Sea Systems Command intends to issue solicitation N00024-18-R-2406 to Huntington Ingalls Incorporated, acting through its Ingalls Shipbuilding division (HII), 1000 Access Road, Pascagoula, MS 39567 on a sole source basis for Detail Design and Construction (DD&amp;C) of the LPD 30 Amphibious Transport Dock Ship and Life Cycle Engineering and Support (LCE&amp;S), which includes post-delivery availability planning, systems integration and engineering support, design, material readiness, and logistics support for the San Antonio Class. The LX(R) requirement that was developed to replace the retiring LSD 41/49 Class amphibious ships will be fulfilled with a San Antonio Class Flight II with LPD 30 as the lead ship. As the designer, builder, and life cycle engineering and support provider of the entire San Antonio Class Flight I, HII is the only source with the requisite knowledge and experience required to construct the lead ship of the San Antonio Class Flight II and provide the required LCE&amp;S. Pursuing an alternate source through competition would result in significant duplication of costs and unacceptable delays due to the loss of design expertise and production efficiencies  achieved on the previous 13 ships that cannot be recovered on the first planned ship of Flight II.  No other vendor possesses the requisite facilities and qualified cadre of engineers, designers, and a construction workforce that can design, plan, construct, test, and deliver current and future amphibious ships.  This notification is issued for subcontracting purposes only.
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis, which shall be considered by the Government. The Government will not reimburse respondents for any questions submitted or information provided as a result of this notice. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

USAID's work with the GOC, civil society, and the private<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>sector focuses on achieving more inclusive and equitable socio-economic development in prioritized rural parts of the country that are conflict-ridden, poor and institutionally weak. The current USAID 2014-2019 Country Development Cooperation Strategy (CDCS) seeks to support an effective presence of democratic institutions and processes in targeted areas; advance reconciliation among victims, ex-combatants and other citizens; foster improved conditions for inclusive, rural economic growth; and strengthen environmental resiliency and low-emissions development.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: normal;"><span style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this Activity is to provide USAID/Colombia with technical and advisory Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) services for USAID/Colombia projects and activities. This includes monitoring support services; evaluations, studies, assessments; GIS mapping and analysis; and collaborating, learning and adapting activities. These services are needed by USAID to create, facilitate, and strengthen informed program management decisions and shape the long-term strategic direction of the Mission&rsquo;s programs and comply with ADS 201 and USAID&rsquo;s Evaluation Policy.</span><span style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</span></p>

USAID/Colombia also expects to rely on the best currently available information to rigorously and credibly make choices, plan effectively, manage adaptively, and learn systematically.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis:
<p>Description:<br />1. Notice: This is not a solicitation but rather a Sources Sought Synopsis to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</p>
<p>2. The purpose of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist, to assist in determining if this effort can be competitive and/or a total Small Business Set-Aside. The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 336419 which has a corresponding Size Standard of 1000 Employees. The Government will use this information to determine the best acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in any business, including all small businesses to include 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned, HUBZone, and Women-Owned Small Business concerns. The Government requests that interested parties respond to this notice if applicable and identify your small business status to the identified NAICS code. Additionally, please provide any anticipated teaming arrangements, along with a description of similar services offered to the Government and to commercial customers for the past three years. Please provide a brief description of how the limitations listed in section 3.b below will be overcome in order to meet the Government's requirement listed in section 3.a below. Any responses involving teaming agreements should delineate between the work that will be accomplished by the prime and the work accomplished by the teaming partners.</p>
<p>3. Program Details:</p>
<p>a. REQUIREMENT.<br />(1) The Guided Missile Maintenance Platform (GMMP), P/N 33307-40000-10, NSN 1450-01-441-4107, consists of a personnel basket which is lowered and raised by a motorized wire rope assembly. It is used by Air Force Personnel to perform maintenance. The GMMP must be able to traverse and ascend/descend along the walls of a missile silo. It must safely contain two maintenance workers and allow them to perform their required maintenance duties. The GMMP must also interface with the power distribution box that is in place at each work site.<br />(2) The GMMP must be manufactured to the dimensions and requirements of drawing 33307-40000 and related sub-drawings. The GMMP must be able to perform all tests contained in Acceptance Test Plan R33307-00046.<br />(3) The Government currently estimates 32 GMMPs are needed to satisfy increased Programmed Depot Maintenance (PDM) requirements. There are no other future projected quantities at this time.</p>
<p>b. LIMITATIONS. The Government does not have all drawing data rights below the top level assemblies from the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). The Government has no other engineering data and/or data rights related to this synopsis. No data other than the top level assembly can be provided to interested vendors.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government does not have sufficient data/rights to be able to independently evaluate and qualify potential manufacturing sources to maintain the GMMP Operational Safety, Suitability, and Effectiveness (OSS&amp;E). Prior to requesting Government approval, companies interested in becoming an approved Government manufacturing source should first obtain GMMP Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), AAI Corporation DBA Textron Systems (CAGE 97384), authorization/certification to accomplish manufacturing and testing. If OEM authorization is not received, the company seeking Government source approval will need to clearly identify how the company will overcome the lack of Government data/rights and maintain the GMMP OSS&amp;E in order to potentially become an approved Government source independent of the OEM authorization/certification.</p>
<p>c. REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Interested parties are requested to submit the following information to assist the Government in developing the acquisition strategy.

<DESC>GUARDIAN ANGEL (GA) <br />Parachute Emergency Procedures Simulator<br />FA8629-18-R-5023<br />Source Sought Synopsis/Request for Information<br /><br />1. NOTICE<br />This Sources Sought Synopsis (SSS)/Request for Information (RFI) is issued for informational purposes and market research only; it does not constitute a solicitation. The Government will not reimburse any company or individual for any expenses associated with preparing/submitting information in response to this posting. The information provided may be used by the Government in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained within their response as instructed later in this posting.
<p>2. BACKGROUND AND SCOPE<br />The United States (US) Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance &amp; Special Operations Forces (ISR &amp; SOF) Directorate, Battlefield Airmen (BA) Program Office (AFLCMC/WISN) is conducting market research to identify possible sources capable of providing a Parachute Emergency Procedures (EP) Simulator. GA requires the ability to modernize its EP training capability. The EP simulator will enhance training while increasing safety prior to parachute training events. This would reduce the chance of injury or death during training &amp; missions. The simulator will provide a structured virtual training event that will increase the parachutist's situational awareness during time of incident, while allowing the parachutist to think through the problem. GA personnel (Combat Rescue Officer (CRO), Pararescuemen (PJ), and Survival, Escape, Resistance, Evasion (SERE)) will use the virtual reality EP simulator to enhance canopy control, canopy malfunctions recognition and response, emergency procedures, increase situational awareness, identify decision altitudes, practice navigation, collision avoidance, and group operations. The EP simulator is not intended as a replacement for any currently fielded GA system, but rather to fill a void in current parachuting EP training requirements</p>
<p>3. CAPABILITY GAP<br />The current capability gap is filled by suspending a jumper in a parachute harness that is hanging by an I-beam or similar structure from a piece of rope. The instructor then places print out photos of different malfunctions over the jumpers head for him to identify and execute the correct EPs. A modern and more realistic Parachuting EP Simulator is needed to mitigate risk, maintain and gain proficiency, and prevent injuries and death.<br /><br />4. INSTRUCTION TO POTENTIAL RESPONDENTS<br />Interested parties who desire to participate in this SSS/RFI are encouraged to submit responses that demonstrate they presently have the technology and qualifications to provide the system described above.

<p><br />ATTENTION small business respondents who are interested in submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for this effort:</p>
<p>No set aside decision has been made; however, the Air Force is contemplating setting this acquisition aside for Small Businesses if there is sufficient demonstrated interest and capability. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a Small Business Set Aside is that two or more small business prime contractors must be capable of performing at least 50% of the entire scope of the effort, as defined in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. The clause reads, in part, as follows: "Limitations on Subcontracting (Nov 2011) ... (c) By submission of an offer and execution of a contract, the Offeror/Contractor agrees that in performance of the contract in the case of a contract for - (1) Services (except construction). At least 50 percent of the cost of contract Performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern... ". Provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc.</p>
<p>If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.</p>
<p>ATTENTION all potential respondents:</p>
<p>The acquisition strategy for this program has not been finalized. If this acquisition is not set aside for small business, it is anticipated that the contract may contain a small business utilization requirement. Please provide feedback on the requirement and what areas are likely candidates for SB subcontracting.</p>
<p>Part II. Capability Survey Questions</p>
<p>1. Is your firm registered in the System for Award Management (SAM), formally known as Central Contractor Registration (CCR)? In accordance with federal regulations, all contractors doing business with the federal government must be registered in the SAM database.</p>
<p>2. Describe briefly the capabilities of the nature of the services you provide.</p>
<p>3. Describe your company's past experience on previous with similar services. Include contract numbers, a brief description of the work performed, period of performance, agency/organization supported, and individual point of contact (Contracting Officer or Program Manager).</p>
<p>4. Are there specific requirements in the documentation that we provide that would currently preclude your product/service from being a viable solution to our requirement?</p>
<p>5. Are there established market prices for our requirement? If you offer this product and/or service to both U.S. Government and commercial sources, is the same workforce used for both the U.S. Government and general public? Is our requirement offered to both under similar terms and conditions? Briefly describe any differences.</p>
<p>If your company is interested, e-mail your responses to joy.hyde@us.af.mil. E-mail responses should be received no later than 15 days after the issuance of this notice. Direct and succinct responses are preferred. Marketing materials are considered an insufficient response.

<DESC>NASA is developing and demonstrating an Integrated Arrival, Departure, and Surface (IADS) system that combines trajectory prediction, scheduling, and data-exchange technologies to reduce airport surface congestion and allow more predictable and efficient departure flows into terminal and en route airspace. This is a collaboration with NASA, FAA, airlines, and airport authorities to improved situational awareness and workload reduction for aircraft operators and controllers. There are 3 phases, and at the end of each successful demonstration phase, NASA will transfer IADS technology to the FAA and aviation industry. Identifying requirements for a successful technology transfer to industry is the primary objective of the collaboration sought through this Notice of Opportunity (NoO). Technologies of primary relevance to this collaboration are those that provide interface between flight operators and IADS.

<SUBJECT>Sources Sought for Co-Brand Agreement for spring-energized staplers and electric solenoid powered staplers
<SOLNBR>CP-04-06-18-01
<RESPDATE>050418
<ARCHDATE>05052018
<CONTACT>Judy Szabo, Phone 703-310-0352, Email jszabo@nib.org
<DESC>On behalf of the AbilityOne Program, NIB, a designated central nonprofit agency, is pursuing a potential co-brand partnership with a U.S. commercial manufacturer to help further expand the product offering of two staplers for the office environment: spring-energized staplers and electric solenoid powered staplers.
<p>&bull;	The term "spring-energized" refers to a stapler that makes use of a spring-and-lever mechanism that allows a degree of finger pressure to equate to a much higher degree of staple-driving force. <br />&bull;	The term "electric solenoid-powered" refers to a stapler that makes use of a motor driven by electricity to drive staples.</p>
<p>If successful, the result will be a co-brand agreement between the manufacturer and its registered brands and the AbilityOne Program. The ultimate expectation is that the co-branded products will 1) replace or renew the items currently on the AbilityOne Procurement List (PL), and 2) expand the AbilityOne product offering to include electric solenoid powered staplers, thus creating more jobs for people who are blind or severely disabled.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the following criteria for the products and the chosen manufacturer must be met.</p>
<p>The chosen manufacturer must:</p>
<p>1.	Be in possession of a nationally known brand name for both spring-energized and electric solenoid-powered staplers that can be demonstrated to have significant appeal through evidence of substantial sales. <br />2.	Demonstrate how it will help the NIB nonprofit agency (NPA) expand its product line of staplers, thus increasing blind work hours, while keeping expansion costs to the NPA at a minimum.   <br />3.	Be willing to set a high priority for delivering bulk materials to the non-profit agency in order to assure the agency of on-time deliveries to the federal government customer(s).<br />4.	Be willing to enter into a multi-year agreement which includes on-going technical and production assistance and the necessary factory trained technical field support while enabling the non-profit agency to meet the criteria of the AbilityOne Program to manufacture, assemble, label, and package the products thereby creating employment for people who are blind or severely disabled.<br />5.	Demonstrate a commitment to working independently with the AbilityOne to market products to the Government customers under the AbilityOne Program. It is preferred that the chosen manufacturer has a dedicated team for Federal Government sales and marketing. <br />6.	Be willing to work with the NPA, NIB, and AbilityOne to ensure that the price to the end-users is a fair and reasonable price.</p>
<p>The products offered by the chosen manufacturer must:</p>
<p>1.	Meet and/or exceed FAR and other Federal Government published standards, Executive Orders and Federal Agency requirements.  <br />2.	Meet industry performance specifications and standards for construction, performance, sustainability and reliability.<br />3.	Be manufactured and lab tested, certified and customer tested to be effective according to their purpose and meet certifications with corresponding documentation designated by customers.</p>
<p>Manufacturers' submissions must demonstrate that that the manufacturer and its proposed products meet the various criteria, as well as indicate what functions the NPA's employees would perform.</p>
<p>The deadline for response is May 4, 2018</p>
<p>Responses should be directed to the contact listed in this Notice.</p>
<p>Questions should be directed to Judy Szabo at 703-310-0352.</p>

<DESC>The VenaSeal  closure system is the only non-tumescent, non-thermal, non-sclerosant procedure that uses a proprietary medical adhesive delivered endovenously to close the vein. This unique approach eliminates the risk of nerve injury when treating the small saphenous vein, which is a risk sometimes associated with certain thermal-based procedures. Clinical studies have demonstrated that the procedure is safe and effective. The procedure is administered without the use of tumescent anesthesia, avoiding patient discomfort associated with multiple needle sticks.

<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) located in Gaithersburg, MD is seeking vendors that can provide Aluminum Compressed Gas Cylinders, as described below.</p>
<p>This announcement is not a Request for Proposals or Quotes (RFP/RFQ) and does not commit the Government to award a contract now or in the future. The information contained in this notice is a DRAFT only and, as such, is subject to change prior to issuance of a solicitation. No solicitation is available at this time. After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive or non-competitive procurement and subsequently award a contract. If at least two qualified small business sources are identified during this market research stage, this acquisition may be solicited as a small business set-aside. NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large and small businesses (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUB Zone, SDVOSB, and VOSB). This requirement is assigned a NAICS code of 325120 (Industrial Gas Manufacturing), with a Small Business Size Standard of 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>Interested business organizations that believe they may be able to meet NIST's requirement detailed below should respond to this notice with a narrative demonstrating their ability to meet NIST's requirement. Contractor's may provide supplemental information at their discretion. Responses should be submitted to latish.walker@nist.gov by 4:00PM ET on Monday, April 16,2018.</p>
<p>The DRAFT requirements are provided below:</p>
<p>BACKGROUND -  The Gas Sensing Metrology Group (GSMG) of the Chemical Sciences Division is responsible for developing, critically evaluating, and applying techniques for the identification and measurement of gaseous species in the atmospheres (urban, rural, and pristine) and process streams (automobile and stack). The group applies these techniques to certification of gas standards in support of industries responding to U.S. and state regulations, environmental concerns, fairness in trade issues, and global climate change. The primary concern is to provide the infrastructure for high-quality, traceable gas measurements, allowing better decision-making by industry, regulators, government officials, research scientists, and the public.  Measurement services are provided through the development of reference materials including NIST Traceable Reference Materials (NTRMs), Reference Materials (RMs), Standard Reference Materials (SRMs). The GSMG prepares and verifies primary standard mixtures (PSM) through gravimetry. These standards are used in the above-mentioned certifications and for participation in worldwide comparisons of standards coordinated by the Bureau International des Poids et Measures (BIPM).</p>
<p>A gas mixture of increasing importance is carbon dioxide in air. Due to the balances available for use, these PSMs can only be prepared in small (5 and 6 L internal volume) cylinders providing a (maximum) 0.73 m3 of useable mixture and must be replaced frequently at great cost in time and material (which is eventually passed on to the customer). The GSMG needs to purchase carbon dioxide in air working standard (WS) gas mixtures in large volume (47L) aluminum compressed gas cylinders. These WSs will be certified using the PSMs and be used to support its production of SRMs, NTRMs as well as for standards used for international comparisons and other certified compress gases thereby preserving the PSMs.</p>
<p>The instrumentation used in the comparison of these standards is very sensitive to the amount of argon in the samples.  Through testing of mixes with different amounts of argon but the same amount of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide it was determined that small variations in the argon content would lead to greater analytical uncertainty than was acceptable to meet the desired total uncertainty of this project.   Because of this effect, we have been asked by both the BIPM and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to use whole, natural or real [not blended or synthetic] air as the balance gas for our standards.</p>

<DESC>On 03/09/18, a Sources Sought notice was posted for the procurement listed below. Due to vendor responses, the Government opened the action for full and open competition on 03/13/2018. The combined synopsis/solicitation closed on 03/21/2018 and no quotes were received.  Because no quotes were received, this notice has been re-posted to make public The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) intent to make the following procurement on a sole-source basis:
<p>The Surface and Upper Air Division Logistics Branch located administratively within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) intends to purchase various louvers used with the Maximum/Minimum Temperature Systems (MMTS) in the Cooperative Observer Program to replenish logistics stock.

The louvers are considered intellectual property of the vendor and is proprietary. This procurement will provide logistical spares for this item for the National Logistics Support Center's (NLSC) National Reconditioning Center.</p>

If the National Logistics Service Center cannot procure the needed logistical spares, it will have a negative impact on the National Weather Service's ability to provide logistical spares that are critical in supporting the Cooperative Observer Program to replenish logistics stock.</p>
<p>The requirements for the items are as follows:</p>

<p>All items shall be delivered to the U.S. Department of Commerce/NOAA/National Reconditioning Center located at 14200 Merritt Road., Grandview, MO 64030.</p>
<p>The Government is not aware of any other vendors that can provide this specialized piece of equipment while also meeting all of the requirements listed above.</p>
<p>The intended procurement is for the logistical spares for the Maximum/Minimum Temperature Systems (MMTS) in the Cooperative Observer Program.

Request for Information (RFI)

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is issuing this RFI in accordance with FAR 15.201(e).  The agency does not intend to award a contract but rather gather information on capability, delivery and other market information pertinent for acquisition planning. The result of this market research will contribute to determining the method of procurement and identify parties having an interest in and the resources to support this requirement for the following: 

Background

As a result of the Veteran s Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act of 2017 (Act), the Board of Veterans  Appeals (Board) anticipates increased workloads.  In addition, in recent fiscal years, the Board has increased its overall full time employee (FTE) numbers.  The vast majority of the increase in FTE has been decision writing attorneys, which has increased the volume of work needing to be done to support those attorneys.  To achieve its goals of providing best possible service to Veterans, BVA must undergo an aggressive transformation that includes initiatives to re-evaluate and streamline business processes, reorganize areas of responsibilities, re-train people, and implement new solutions to reduce the appeals wait times by adjudicating appeals faster and at a higher quality. 

Existing laws and regulations established a Veterans benefits appeals process that has sequential steps following benefits claim adjudication by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA), or VA s Office of General Counsel (OGC).  The Act puts in place a new system that will provide Veteran s multiple options following benefits claim adjudication by VBA, VHA, NCA, or OGC.  The anticipated effective date of the Act is February 14, 2019.  Though the Act provides for opportunities for Veterans who have existing appeals to opt-in to the new system it is anticipated that not all will.  The Veterans who do not opt-in will have their appeals adjudicated under the laws and regulations as they existed prior to the Act or what VA is calling the legacy system.  Until these legacy claims are resolved the Board will have to work both legacy appeals and new appeals in tandem.     

These Board requirements are focused on legacy claims file review.  The Board has a requirement for a Contractor to provide Paralegal Legal Level I support to improve the efficiency of the adjudicatory process.  The Board must modernize its current claims file document review system.  The chosen Contractor will provide paralegal services to support analyzing, organizing, and delivering documentation submitted by or for Veterans to the Board s legal staff in the Office of Appellate Operations (OAO).  


 
Objective

The Board seeks to obtain paralegal support for the Board related to the administration of Veterans benefits appeals processing.  The Board desires to improve its ability to support OAO legal staff by identifying the legally relevant evidence in a file thereby significantly reducing the size of the claims files that are reviewed by the OAO attorneys and Veterans Law Judges (VLJ).  The objective is to increase decision volume by reducing the number of documents that have to be reviewed by a Board attorney when drafting a decision.  

The Contractor shall understand and support BVA s mission as it relates to adjudicating disability appeals for Veterans and other appellants. In order to do this, the Contractor shall perform the following: 

Claims file Review

A. Receive claims file for legacy claims: Information packages will be delivered electronically to the Contractor via Boards document review software, which Contractor will use to review and label relevant documents.  Contractor shall prioritize and complete packages based on date received and docket order.

B. Contractor shall ensure all necessary administrative actions have been completed.

The below list represents administrative actions that should have been performed by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ). However, these tasks are not always completed.  Therefore, it is necessary for the Contractor to conduct a quality check to ensure package completeness. In the event any of these issues are found to be unaddressed, The Contractor shall flag all uncomplete items and notify Board Administrative Support so they may take action to complete the package. The Contractor shall use BVA proprietary software to send unaddressed issues to the responsible BVA point of contact that handles unaddressed issues.  

Administratively complete package checklist includes all of the following: 
Privacy Act requests completed
Power of attorney issues handled
Waivers of Regional Office RO s initial consideration of additional provided
Pending scanning banner completed/removed
Hearing requests fulfilled and transcripts associated with the record
Extension requests completed
Informal hearing presentations obtained
Advance on the docket (AOD) motions rulings handled
Relevant Board documents sent to last known address
 All foreign language documents translated
11. Misfiled documents associated with the correct file

C. Contractor shall review all submitted documentation, determine the issue(s) on appeal, and identify all relevant documents.  

a)  The Contractor shall use standard naming conventions to label each document.

b)  The Contractor shall identify the date on which VA received the document.

c)  The relevant documents identified by the Contractor shall include: 

i. Relevant procedural documents, including rating code sheets
ii. All relevant evidence including lay statements, medical evidence, and other relevant evidence regarding the issue(s) on appeal
iii. Service records, including service personnel and treatment records
iv. All VA Form 21-22s (and 21-22a)
v. Hearing transcripts
vi. All communications regarding the issue(s) on appeal, including VA Form 21-4142s vii. Records from the Social Security Administration (SSA)
viii. Veterans Claims Assistance Act (VCAA) letters
ix. Any formal findings made by the Agency of Original Jurisdiction (AOJ)
x. Documentation regarding the duty to assist
xi. In the case of substitution or dependency and indemnity compensation claims, the death certificate, marriage license, and dependency information and evidence, and 
xii. All other relevant documents

D. Contractor shall be expected to provide customer service to internal BVA personnel, especially when responding to telephone and email inquiries with the point of contact for the Board.

NOTE: Task 2 and 3 are conducted simultaneously

E. Quantity: 

Contractor shall perform such review in the quantity necessary to support the Board s weekly adjudication of legacy claims.  The Board anticipates this being approximately 1,000 claims file a week.  A claims file can range from 100 documents to 1,000 plus.  At last measure the average electronic claims file included 243 documents. The Government anticipates that 70 to 80 Paralegals Level I will be needed for this effort.

<DESC>THIS IS A Special Notice ONLY. The U.S. Government currently intends to award a contract for HAAS Automation's Computer Numeric Control (CNC) Lathe (TL-1) and HAAS Automation's CNC Mill (TM-1) on a SOLE SOURCE basis.
<p>The proposed sole source, firm fixed price contract to Phillips Corporation for HAAS CNC Lathe (TL-1) and HAAS CNC Mill (TM-1). The statutory authority for the sole source procurement is FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold (SAT), contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g. urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand name, or industrial mobilization). Delivery of this contract is intended to provide the U.S. Army Ordnance School the capability to acquire HAAS Automation's CNC Toolroom Lathes (TL-1) and CNC Toolroom Mills (TM-1). Currently, the US Army is fielding the Metalworking Machine Shop Set (MWMSS) to the operating force and the U.S. Army Ordnance School, which includes the HAAS TL-1 Lathe and TM-1 Mill; thus, the Ordnance School conducts machinist training on these exact machines for the 914A WOBC (TLC), 91E30 (ALC) and 91E10 (IET) Students. This equipment is shared across these three courses to facilitate hands on training for CNC machining.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ)/Invitation for Bid (IFB)/Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ, IFB or RFP in the future. This notice does not commit the U.S. Government to contract for any supply or service. Further, the U.S. Government is not seeking quotes, bids or proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals in response to this special notice. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice. Submittals will not be returned to the responder. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. However, if a competitive solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Government-wide Point of Entry. It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor the Government-wide Point of Entry for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>

<RESPDATE>041318
<CONTACT>Kemper Nichole Wood, Email knwood@fbi.gov
<DESC>PLEASE READ THIS NOTICE CAREFULLY AS IT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY NOTICE THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) intends to negotiate a sole source, fixed price, Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) with Kapa Biosystems, Inc., 200 Ballardvale Street Suite 250, Wilmington, MA, 01887-1074 for the purpose of procuring Kapa consumable supplies.
<p>The FBI is in the process of evaluating Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) platforms and technologies in order to increase the FBI Laboratory DNA analysis capabilities. All NGS protocols require that DNA be extracted from a sample prior to being carried through a number of steps to prepare it for sequencing on an NGS instrument. The FBI is currently validating a NGS assay for sequencing of the mitochondrial DNA that requires reagents from Kapa Biosystems, Inc.. Without these reagents, the DNA cannot be properly prepared for Next Generation Sequencing, which will in turn restrict the FBI Laboratory's ability to validate NGS for casework implementation.</p>
<p>The Kapa fragmentase is the only one on the market that produces uniform fragmentation not biased by DNA sequence. Additionally, when the FBI tested the Kapa reagents against reagents from other vendors, the Kapa reagents consistently outperformed the others. These reagents have now been incorporated in protocols currently in routine use in the FBI. Substitution of the Kapa reagents with those from another vendor would both compromise the optimized protocols and require substantial additional testing and evaluation.</p>
<p>Based on market research, and Government end-users, it has been determined that Kapa Biosystems, Inc.&nbsp;is the sole manufacturer of the required Kapa consumable supplies. Kapa Biosystems, Inc.&nbsp;does has an authorized reseller of some of their consumables, however the reseller does not offer the full array of the necessary consumables for the FBI's ongoing validations. Therefore, Kapa Biosystems, Inc.&nbsp;is the only vendor capable of providing the required Kapa consumable supplies.</p>
<p>This notice will be distributed solely through the General Services Administration's Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) Website (www.fedbizopps.gov). Interested parties are responsible for monitoring the FBO site to ensure they have the most up-to-date information about this acquisition. The North American Classification System Code is 325412, Pharmaceutical Preparation Manufacturing.</p>
<p>The FBI intends to negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Interested parties may identify their interests and capability to respond to this requirement to the attention of: Kemper Wood, email address: knwood@fbi.gov by Friday, April 13, 2018 (8:00 am Eastern). Emailed responses will only be considered. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is at the discretion of the Government.</p>
<p>Vendors must be registered in SAM, effective July 29, 2012 to receive government contracts. The FBI uses a financial system that has a direct interface with SAM. Please ensure that your company's SAM information is updated and accurate. This includes TIN, EFT, DUNS, addresses and contact information. The EFT banking information on file in SAM will be what the FBI uses to process payment to your organization.</p>
