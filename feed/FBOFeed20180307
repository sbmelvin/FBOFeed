<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT.

The purpose of this sources sought announcement is for market research to make an appropriate acquisition decision and to gain knowledge of potential qualified businesses interested and capable of providing the services described below. Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise and experience to compete for this acquisition.

Background
The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages 150,000 miles of streams and rivers, and 13 million acres of wetlands in fourteen western states (California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, New Mexico, Arizona and Wyoming). The BLM has need for comprehensive wetland and riparian inventory that captures the extent and status of these ecosystems across BLM administered lands in the Western U.S. and Alaska. This inventory will help provide a basis for understanding land health and management of BLM lands through four fundamental areas of functioning wetland and riparian ecosystems. These four fundamental areas cover: properly functioning watersheds, compliance with state water quality standards, habitats restored or maintained for federal threatened and endangered species and others, and the maintenance of ecological processes that sustain healthy biotic populations and communities. In addition, this effort will inform the investigation of wetland status, condition, and trend across much of the U.S. 

Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring (AIM) methods and data collection span various habitats. BLM lands include uplands, aquatic/riparian areas, and wetlands/lentic areas, and AIM monitoring occurs in all of these land types. AIM information is used to inform Land Use Plan Effectiveness evaluations, livestock grazing permit renewals, reclamation or restoration efforts, and habitat assessments (including for Greater Sage-Grouse), among others.

Scope
BLM will require the collection of data from up to 2500 quad maps per year across all BLM lands. Data collected must meet Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Wetland Mapping Standards Document number: FGDC-STD-015-2099, located at www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/wetlands-mapping/index_html and follow an object-based image analysis approach to be consistent with existing mapping efforts. Mapping must be fine enough to capture all wetland and riparian area polygon features that are at least one-tenth to one-quarter of an acre. Mapping shall consider climatology, geomorphology, geology, ecology, and hydrology. Offeror must provide or acquire base data sets. QA/QC protocols shall be rigorous, and shall include a component of field verification. Work is often in remote areas and will require collaboration with local field offices. 

Once mapping is completed and has been verified via QA/QC processes, polygons should be assigned landscape position,
landform, water flow path and waterbody type (LLWW) classification using the modified West-specific classification system. In addition, a hydrogeomorphic (HGM) subclass will be assigned based on wetland characteristics derived from both the Cowardin et al.1979, and the modified West-specific LLWW. Key variables that contribute to assignment of these subclasses will be geomorphic setting (e.g. isolated depression, flowing, fringe, etc.), water source (e.g. precipitation, groundwater, lateral flow, etc.), and hydrodynamic properties (e.g. vertical fluctuation, dynamic flow, etc.). 

As United States Geological Services (USGS) quads get completed, edge matching and topological structuring of adjacent quads must be performed to create a seamless wetland and riparian area database. Topology validation scripts and other verification tools should be run on the final merged dataset to ensure data integrity. 

Offeror shall develop full project metadata for the final wetland and riparian area database. This metadata will be formatted to meet the FGDC Metadata Guidelines, which work in conjunction with the ISO metadata standards (FGDC 2016). 

This sources sought shall not be considered as a request for proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the contractor submission of this sources sought or the Government's use of such information. The Government reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any contractor's input resulting from this request.  No contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement.  Data submitted in response to this request will not be returned.

The North American Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 541370-Surveying and Mapping (except Geophysical) Services,

INSTRUCTION FOR SOURCES SOUGHT SUBMISSION:
After review of this requirement, interested parties may submit a response in an electronic format only via email to jchamberlin@blm.gov no later than 27 March 2018 2:00PM MT. Electronic files shall be in Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat PDF format. 

Respondents shall include the following as part of their submission:
a.	A synopsis of the company's capabilities to provide comprehensive wetland mapping and LLWW Classification. Please include previous work.
b.	Indicate companys capability to provide services in all 14 Western States or indicate specific states service will be provided
 
c.	DUNS Number
d.	Company Name
e.	Company Address
f.	Business size, SDVOSB, HUBZone, or Woman owned status, as validated via the System for Award Administration (SAM).  All offers must register on the SAM located at http://www.SAM.gov
g.	Company point of contact, phone and email address.

The information submitted should not exceed a total of 6 one-sided 8 x 11 pages, with one inch margins, and font no smaller than 12 point.

After review of the responses to this announcement, the Government intends to proceed with the acquisition and a subsequent solicitation shall be published.

<SUBJECT>IGF::OT::IGF Cle Elum Gate, Helix, and Intake.
<SOLNBR>140R1018R0016
<CONTACT>Gordon, Connie
<DESC>The Department of Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, Pacific Northwest Region requires the construction of an Intake Structure, Helix and Gate Chamber at the Cle Elum Dam.  The Intake Structure consists of six reinforced concrete intake structures stacked vertically that follow the existing reservoir rim contours and allow water and fish to be drawn into the juvenile facility over a reservoir water surface fluctuation of 63 feet.  The water is controlled at each intake structure by an overflow weir crest gate.  The water then flows to the juvenile facility through precast concrete conduits that range in length from 500 feet to 50 feet with the longest length being the bottom intake.  The precast conduit transitions to a concrete encased steel pipe that penetrates through the secant pile shaft into the Gate Chamber.

The Gate Chamber houses an underground 6-story tall steel structure that supports the guard gate and steel pipe for each of the 6 intake levels within the previously constructed secant pile shaft.  The size of the Gate Chamber is to provide the hydraulics required for the steel pipe transition to the helix structure.  An access structure is provided in the Gate Chamber for entry and egress by a stairwell and elevator shaft.

The Helix Chamber houses an underground 48-foot diameter helix structure that dissipates the energy from transporting water and fish from a vertical distance of over 80 feet.  The structural support system for the helix is a steel braced frame system that supports a precast concrete flume used to transport the water and fish.  An access structure is provided in the center of the helix for entry and egress by a stairwell and elevator shaft.

The Gate and Helix Chambers are fully enclosed by a roof constructed with steel trusses and joists with a reinforced concrete deck.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 237990 and the size standard is $36.5 million.  The Davis-Bacon Act applies to this procurement.  

We anticipate issuing a Request for Proposals (RFP) approximately 15 April 2018 at www.fbo.gov., but all dates in this notice are subject to change.  Any amendments applicable to the solicitation will be posted at the same site.  To take advantage of business opportunities with the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and the Department of the Interior (DOI) you must register your firm with the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov.        

Reclamation intends to award one firm fixed-price contract.  The estimated price of the work is between $50,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00.  Any award will be based on the best value to the Government.  This requirement will be solicited as a full and open procurement that will consider past performance and price in the award decision; these evaluation factors are subject to change.  Final evaluation factors will be defined in the solicitation.

<DESC><p>NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has a requirement for a Mercury Cadmium Telluride (HgCdTe) Avalanche Photodiode (APD) Integrated Detector Cooler Assembly (IDCA).</p>
<p>NASA/GSFC intends to issue a sole-source Request for Proposal (RFP) to Leonardo DRS, Incorporated, for the HgCdTe APD IDCA. Dr. James Abshire, Principal Investigator at the NASA/GSFC, in partnership with Leonardo DRS, submitted a proposal entitled "MARLI: MARs Lidar for global climate measurements from orbit" to the NASA Research Announcement (NRA) NNH16ZDA001N-MatISSE, Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES-2016), Program Element C.19, Maturation of Instruments for Solar System Explorattion (MatISSE) Program. On June 26, 2017, NASA Headquarters selected this proposal to provide support to NASA.&nbsp; DRS will support the development of the IDCA which consists of a 4x4 HgCdTe APD arrays on a ceramic chip carrier from earlier NASA programs with DRS, and a 1/5 watts mini-cryo-cooler-Dewar system from DRS. The period of performance is approximately 18 months for delivery.</p>
<p>DRS is uniquely qualified because of their qualification and past performance of the prospective vendor as described below:</p>
<p>(a) DRS is the original inventor of this type of HgCdTe APD, trademarked HDVIP&#61650; (high-density vertically-integrated photodiode), that has achieve the required performance. DRS has their company proprietary information about the fabrication process and has been producing this type of device for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>(b) NASA GSFC has collaborated with DRS to modify the HgCdTe APD array design for space lidar applications since 2011 under a NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) Instrument Incubator Program (IIP) and an Advanced Component Technology (ACT) program. NASA GSFC has subsequently purchased two more devices for other space lidar development. DRS has steadily improved the device performance and reliability under these past NASA investments.</p>
<p>(c) NASA GSFC have been using the HgCdTe APD arrays from DRS in third-party laboratory cryo-coolers in the airborne CO2 and CH4 lidar experiments since 2014. These new detectors have enabled NASA GSFC to achieve much superior measurement performance than with other types of detectors. NASA GSFC has also developed interface electronics, control software, and signal processing techniques for this type of detector.</p>
<p>(d) DRS has a product line of ruggedized mini-Stirling cryo-coolers for military applications. The coolers have been shown to withstand vibration from a rocket launch. DRS has conducted a multi-year lifetime test and demonstrated their mini-cryo-cooler can meet the &gt;3 year requirement.</p>
<p>(e) DRS has recently integrated a 16-pixel HgCdTe APD array into a 1/5 watts mini-cryo-cooler under a NASA ESTO In-space Validation of Earth Science Technology (InVEST) program. The two IDCA's they delivered have undergone environmental tests at NASA GSFC and reached a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6.</p>
<p>(f) The HgCdTe APD arrays produced by DRS have been tested for radiation damage from proton and gamma ray at NASA GSFC. The test data shows they are capable of withstanding space radiation for a typical multi-year space mission.</p>
<p>Statutory authority for this sole source procurement is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1)--Only One Responsible Source. However, organizations who believe they can provide these services without any detrimental impact to the program schedules supported by this work should fully identify their interest and capabilities within 15 days after publication of this synopsis.</p>
<p>Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on March 22, 2018. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.</p>

<p><br />Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Crane Division intends to issue a Job Order (JO) Modification to Job Order 0004 for option years one and two under a sole source Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) N00164-17-G-JQ02. The original BOA was issued to Raytheon Company, McKinney, TX. Acquisitions under the BOA have been and will be conducted on a sole source basis in accordance with the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1. The basis for restricting competition was the lack of sufficient technical data, restricted software rights, duplicative cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and the unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency requirement through any other source. As a result of this JO, the overall contract ceiling for BOA N00164-12-G-JQ02 will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>This modification to JO-0004 is anticipated to procure engineering services in support of life-cycle sustainment of the Multi-Spectral Targeting System (MTS). The required support will consist of but is not limited to: program management, repair of repairables, platform integration support, support equipment enhancements, software sustainment program support, depot maintenance technical support, and various other support services. The services are for two-one year option periods. The total estimated amount is $8,000,000.</p>
<p><br />Request for proposal will not be made available through <a href="http://www.fbo.gov">http://www.fbo.gov</a>. The request for proposal will be provided to Raytheon Company through electronic mail. The proposed noncompetitive contract action is anticipated to be awarded under FAR part 15, contracting by negotiations.

<p>Offered space must meet Government requirements for fire safety, accessibility, seismic, and sustainability standards per the terms of the Lease. A fully serviced lease not required. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.<br />The U.S. Government currently occupies office and related space in a building under a lease in Charlotte, NC, that will be expiring. The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternative space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunication infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

<DESC>The USGS Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center requires a minimum of two and a maximum of five high-pressure marine air compressors to run multiple airgun seismic sources during a 19-23 day scientific research cruise to be conducted in the mid-Atlantic region in August 2018.
The USGS is requesting bids for two possible options (Option 1 and Option 2) that differ in the minimum required total Standard Cubic Feet per Minute (SCFM) capability of the compressors. Vendor may submit quotes for either or both options
For Option 1, the Vendor will supply at least two diesel-powered compressors delivering a minimum total of 250 SCFM of air.
For Option 2, the Vendor will supply at least two diesel-powered compressors delivering a minimum total of 500 SCFM of air.
For either option, the vendor shall provide an experienced compressor technician for a minimum of two days of ship mobilization in Lewes, Delaware. The compressor technician may also be required to participate in the 19-to-23-day at-sea portion of this project and one day ship demobilization at the end of the project. The USGS may decide, and inform the vendor no later than 45 calendar days prior to the first day of mobilization, to use qualified USGS compressor technicians and not a vendor-provided compressor technician for the at-sea portion of the project. In this case, the USGS would send one USGS compressor technician to the vendor's facility at USGS expense to be trained on the leased compressor model.

There are no option periods.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION <br /><br />1. INTRODUCTION This is a Request for Information (RFI) only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Commander, Navy Installations Command (CNIC) will take procurement action in this matter. Further, CNIC will not be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information. This RFI is being used to gather market research for CNIC to make decisions regarding child care in both military and private sector operated child care programs. Navy Children Youth Programs is seeking expressions of interest and a statement of capabilities from any public or private organization that is interested in securing child care services and is capable of providing child care infrastructure capacity.<br /><br />&nbsp;2. BACKGROUND The Navy Child &amp; Youth Program (CYP) supports military and Department of Defense (DoD) families worldwide as they protect and serve our country. We do this by providing high quality, innovative, accessible, and affordable child care that supports school readiness, and recreational programs for military and children and youth world-wide. <br /><br />A leader in child care reform, Navy CYP has aggressively responded to the requirements of the 1989 Military Child Care Act (MCCA) by raising the bar for quality expectations, increasing performance and outcomes criteria, and investing in critical resources including personnel, professional development, facilities, and technology. Today, Navy CYP is known and well-respected for the tremendous impact it has had on the entire early childhood and youth services landscape&mdash;not just for military child care and the families it serves, but also for children and families who participate in non-military operated programs. <br /><br />The MCCA was a pivotal moment for military child care. Congress passed the MCCA in response to great concern over the lack of quality and accessibility of child care for military families. The MCCA became the catalyst for a complete transformation of military child care, and focused on improving the quality, affordability, and accessibility of military child care by: <br /><br />&bull; Requiring the development and implementation of comprehensive standards; &bull; Establishing national accreditation requirements; <br /><br />&bull; Enforcing licensing mandates through a rigorous inspection and annual certification process; &bull; Creating an effective and efficient child care subsidy system to reduce the financial burden on military families, and implementing a sliding fee scale based on family income; &bull; Improving wages for staff; <br /><br />&bull; Strengthening training and professional development, including providing designated Training Specialists to support training and curriculum development; <br /><br />&bull; Developing an effective inspection system, including unannounced inspection visits and closure for noncompliance. <br /><br />Today, Navy CYP operates over 50,000 child care spaces world-wide through 237 Navy owned Child Development facilities, Navy certified Family Child Care Homes, and through subsidized commercial child care facilities throughout the United States that meet MCCA requirements. We manage our requests for care and waiting list through MilitaryChildCare.com that provides eligible families with all locations that are part of the DoD network of military child care including real-time anticipated wait times for care. Within Kitsap County, there has historically been lack of available, affordable, quality child care spaces in both military and private sector operated child care programs. <br /><br />3. NAVY COMMUNITY BASED CHILDCARE PROGRAM (CBC) Navy CYP seeks to partner with private sector organizations in order to increase capacity and quality of child care within Kitsap County. The Navy is in the position to provide child care services including staff and supplies and would like to explore opportunities where this service could be provided to children sponsored by the proposing organizations as well as the military and DOD civilian community. This effort is called Community Based Childcare (CBC). Proposing entities will be responsible for fixed assets, building supplies, playground equipment and other operational and physical requirements. The benefitting population of children who will receive child care services under the CBC will be both military and DoD civilian children and children deemed eligible by the private sector participating entity. The Navy proposes to provide child care services meeting operating requirements described in &ldquo;Informational Resources&rdquo; section below that include the following features: <br /><br />a) All providers coming into direct contact with children are subject to thorough background checks; <br /><br />b) Daily childcare and development services by trained and certified early childhood professionals; <br /><br />c) Service Hours: Monday &ndash; Friday 0600-1800; <br /><br />d) Established early childhood curriculum; <br /><br />e) Annual program inspections by Navy Early Childhood Specialists; <br /><br />f) Meet early childhood learning standards, via National Association of the Education of Young Children (NAEYC); <br /><br />g) Provide a comprehensive inclusion program to support children with special needs; <br /><br />h) Developmentally appropriate classrooms furniture and supplies, including consumables; <br /><br />i) Established parent fees based on total family income;<br /><br />&nbsp;j) Food service program that meets USDA standards.<br /><br />&nbsp;In order to be considered for participation in the CBC Program, interested organizations must provide a space that meets or exceed the following criteria: <br /><br />a) Meet all federal, state and DOD criteria for providing childcare; <br /><br />b) CBC must meet Unified Facilities Criteria for Military Child Development Centers (F<br />or details see 4 (b) below);<br /><br />&nbsp;c) All child care spaces must be within Kitsap County; <br /><br />d) A minimum of 100 dedicated spaces available for Military/DOD civilian children ages 0-5; <br /><br />e) Entities will be required to provide proof of adequate liability insurance.<br /><br />&nbsp;4. INFORMATIONAL RESOURCES<br /><br />&nbsp;a) Military Child Care Act - https://elibrary.cnic-n9portal.net <br /><br />b) DoD Unified Facilities Criteria for &ldquo;Military Child Development Centers&rdquo; - https://elibrary.cnic-n9portal.net <br /><br />c) DoDINST 6060.2 &ldquo;Military Child Development Programs&rdquo; - https://elibrary.cnic-n9portal.net <br /><br />d) DoDINST 1402.5 &ldquo;Background Checks for Individuals Working with Children&rdquo; - https://elibrary.cnic-n9portal.net <br /><br />5. PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE Contract term length is negotiable. <br /><br />6. TYPE OF CONTRACT The Navy intends to utilize firm fixed-price contract type and reserves the right to make multiple awards in order to meet its child care needs. <br /><br />7. PRE-PROPOSAL CONFERENCE A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held on March 21, 2018 in Kitsap County. Interested parties should RSVP via email to Gary Hammonds at gary.hammonds@navy.mil &amp; Michelle Estabrook at michelle.estabrook@navy.mil no later than March 14, 2018.

<p>Langley Research Center - LOFTID Project Lead<br />Marshall Space Flight Center - LOFTID Propulsion and Avionics Collaborative Support</p>
<p><br />Low Earth Orbit Flight Test - Inflatable Decelerator<br />Ancillary Gas Generator - Based Inflation Source<br />Request for Information</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) invites Industry to submit a response to this inquiry to assist NASA in assessing the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) and possible inclusion on the Low Earth Orbit Flight Test of an Inflatable Decelerator (LOFTID) flight experiment of an Ancillary inflation system gas-generator. Industry response to this Request for Information (RFI) is requested within the context of the requirements and general approach described in the following sections and the associated appendix. A detailed description of the LOFTID Ancillary Gas Generator (LAGG) and related system design requirements are contained in Appendix-A of this Request for Information.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>A Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) is a deployable aeroshell consisting of an inflatable structure that maintains shape during atmospheric flight and a flexible thermal protection system protecting the entry vehicle through hypersonic atmospheric entry.<br />Envisioned applications of this inflatable technology include International Space Station down mass, lower cost access to space through launch vehicle asset recovery and high mass/high altitude deliveries (including humans) to Mars.</p>
<p>LOFTID is a demonstration flight project that will be used to validate thermal and structural models, and mature understanding of HIAD technologies. An ancillary inflation system gas- generator is being considered for the LOFTID flight experiment to begin the task of developing hydrogen gas generator technology for HIAD use. Hydrogen gas was selected as the highest storage density solution, and for its possible synergy with future deep space liquid propulsion systems. (though, some other products in the generated gas could be tolerated). The concept chosen for the H&#8322; ancillary inflation system gas generator demonstration could be used for the limited, initial, in-flight inflation of an inflatable aeroshell decelerator. There is very little micro- gravity flight experience available for such gas generators. Including a LAGG device in parallel with the primary passive (nitrogen gas) inflation system of the LOFTID potentially offers NASA a low-risk opportunity to gather such data. Larger scale HIADs for future NASA missions will likely require infusion such active hydrogen gas generation technology.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Requested Response Topics</strong></p>
<p>The specific objective of this RFI is to solicit information to assist NASA in determining the viability of including an ancillary inflation system gas-generator within the LOFTID demonstration flight reentry vehicle. Specific goals for this solicitation and eventual flight experiment, if pursued, include:</p>
<p>&bull; Determine and understand the current / proposed state-of-the-art of H&#8322; gas generators;<br />&bull; Demonstrate the adequacy of the selected device: design; safe storage, handling, use, and recovery, and (if possible) determine the post-functioning physical condition of the device;<br />&bull; In a one (g) environment, determine ignition characteristics, reaction state of the medium used to produce H&#8322; gas, the total action time, the gas output temperature, the moisture content, and any evidence of particulate in the output H&#8322; gas;<br />&bull; Derive from a low (g) flight-environment the output pressure and action time of the device.<br />&bull; Determine the theoretical and measured H&#8322; recovery percentage of the chosen medium.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Comments are requested but not limited to any of the following topics:</p>
<p>&bull; Ancillary inflation system gas-generator conceptual design, performance, and capabilities;<br />&bull; Notional top-level concept of operations for proposed ancillary inflation system gas- generator including initiation requirements and hazards of medium before and after use;<br />&bull; Conceptual ancillary inflation system gas-generator development program including rough order-of-magnitude funding requirements and top-level schedule (including vendor recommended development units);<br />&bull; Suggestions for possible Industry-Government teaming arrangements related to the ancillary inflation system gas-generator development.</p>
<p><br /><strong>Response Instructions</strong></p>
<p>The information obtained will be used by NASA for planning and acquisition strategy development. No information or questions received will be posted to any website or public access location. NASA does not plan to respond to the individual responses. This RFI is being used to obtain information for planning purposes only and the Government does not presently intend to award a contract at this time. As stipulated in FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. This RFI is subject to FAR 52.215-3.</p>
<p>All responses should be provided in MS Word document format via electronic media. Font should be Times New Roman, size 12. Responses should not exceed 30 pages. Please submit responses no later than April 17, 2018, to NASA/MSFC Propulsion Systems Department, ER52/Thomas F.

<p>MORU 219680<br />Mount Rushmore National Memorial, Rehabilitate Visitor Center and Replace Plaza Paver System<br />NAICS Code: 237990<br />PSC Code: Z2QA<br />Estimated Cost Range: $5 million - $10 million<br />Estimated Period of Performance: November 2018 - May 2020</p>
<p>Project Description<br />Mount Rushmore National Memorial is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota, near to Jewel Cave National Monument and Wind Cave National Park. The project comprises two major components: (1) Rehabilitate and/or stabilize the Visitor Center, and (2) Replace the walkway and Plaza paver system.</p>
<p>The Visitor Center building, a cast-in-place concrete structure with a granite fa&ccedil;ade, was constructed during the 1990s, and has experienced water intrusion and the consequential deterioration of building components, systems, and finishes. The deterioration has resulted in increased operational maintenance and cleaning costs, and negatively impacts visitor experience. The Visitor Center rooftop system, the Grand View Terrace Plaza paving system, and associated exterior concrete staircases will be reconstructed to prevent further water intrusion into the building. The project scope also includes HVAC, interior and exterior lighting upgrades, two elevator replacements, multiple public restroom renovations, and, upgrading and replacing wall, floor and ceiling building finishes.</p>
<p>A pre-cast concrete walkway paver system was also laid in the early 1990s and extensive paver displacement, heaving, and disintegration have occurred due to water infiltration and retention, and subsequent freeze-thaw action. The lower avenue walkway and Avenue of Flags provide the principle access to the Grand View Terrace for viewing the Memorial sculpture. Starting at the parking garages, the walkway extends past the concession facilities and to the Visitor Center roof top, the Grand View Terrace. The project scope includes demolition of the complete walkway paving system and installation of a new below-grade storm water drainage system and new concrete pavement system. The project will upgrade the pavement system to comply with current accessibility standards and widen the Avenue of Flags to improve visitor experience. The Avenue of Flags flag columns will be demolished and reconstructed as part of this project.</p>
<p>The project will be constructed as a single project, but as the Memorial receives more than 2.4 million visitors a year, it will be sequenced to accommodate seasonal weather variations and visitation, access logistics, and temporary facility closures.</p>
<p>Firms interested in the project should possess the following specialized skills and experience, in their responses to this Notice.</p>
<p>1) Including selective demolition, rehabilitation, renovation and repair of structures,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; including roofing system repairs and elevator installation.<br />2) Including pavement construction, site furniture and retaining wall construction, and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; installation of site utilities and drainage systems.<br />3) Installation of architectural grade concrete paving and pavement systems and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;specialty concrete working techniques.<br />4) Working in a similar environment, including:<br />a. Sequencing work operations to facilitate challenging access logistics and storage<br />b. Sequencing work operations to facilitate visitor access<br />c. Experience working in cold weather conditions<br />d. Responsibility for the protection of cultural and natural resources<br />e. Experience working in remote area where material deliveries and worker commutes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;may be difficult.</p>
<p>Bonding Capability <br />Interested firms MUST provide a letter from their bonding company to confirm their bonding capacity.</p>

This is a Sources Sought Synopsis announcement, a market survey for information to be used for preliminary planning purposes. The information received will be used within the Navy to facilitate the decision-making process and will not be disclosed outside of the agency. The intent of this Sources Sought Synopsis is to identify potential qualified Small Businesses, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) certified 8(a) Businesses, SBA certified HUBZone Small Businesses, Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses, Women-Owned Small Business, and/or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses.
 This Sources Sought Synopsis is one facet in the Governments overall market research regarding whether the proposed solicitation will be issued as a competitive set-aside or as full and open (unrestricted). No procurement strategy will be determined based solely on the information received in response to this Sources Sought Synopsis.

No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this announcement or any requested follow-up information. This notice does not constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose other than market research. Respondents will not be notified of the results of this market research.

The proposed project includes the following:

Demolition of thirty-one (31) existing magazines at Harvey Point Defense Testing Activity (HPDTA), North Carolina, and construction of ten (10) new 14-foot tall, 80-foot long Army 421-80-08 type MSM Magazines. 

Construction and demolition will occur in two phases. During construction of each phase, some magazines will be active. Demolition scope consists of 31 existing ECMs, which are constructed of  thick steel with steel headwalls, constructed on concrete pads. Electrical and communications will also be demolished. Fences will be partially demolished to construct a temporary contractor entrance for each phase. Demolition includes erosion and sediment control measures and fencing of a stockpile area for storage and processing of demolished materials.
 

Exterior pavement includes asphalt drives and concrete aprons for each magazine. Magazine access from the concrete aprons include fabricated mechanical, adjustable steel ramps adjacent the magazine doors (for each magazine). Each magazine will include heavy steel blast resistant 8 swing doors mounted to a steel frame. Site improvements include low-impact development (LID) features. Grading includes earth cover over the magazines, with a minimum of two feet of cover, and 2:1 side slopes to match grade at the bottom of slope. Stabilizing cover over the magazine earth cover will consist of grass. Site utilities required include power and communications. Underground primary and secondary service, feeders, branch circuit cables include concrete encased, PVC coated, rigid galvanized steel conduit.
 Foundation work includes driven, square pre-stressed concrete piles (SPPCP) with predrilling of the pile locations prior to pile installation. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) include new security cameras and fiber optic cabling, balanced magnetic switches, processing control unit, motion detectors, and card reader with keypad. Temporary security cameras for the laydown area during construction are required. Power and IDS will be maintained to active magazines during the demolition/construction of each phase. Exterior lighting systems include illumination for exterior building entrances and site operations lighting. Interior lighting must have Class II, Division 1 rating. Security systems also include new fence shake detection system for fencing and gates.

The estimated construction cost is between $10,000,000 and $25,000,000.
  

The anticipated award of this contract is October 2018.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this project is 236220, Commercial and Institutional Building Construction, with a small business size standard of $36.5 million.  The PSC is Y1EA  Construction of Ammunition Facilities.

Should the resulting solicitation be a set-aside for small business or 8(a) concerns, the resulting contract will include FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, which currently requires a small business concern to perform at least 15 percent of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of materials, with its own employees.

GENERAL DEFINITIONS:
Critical Value.  A test result that requires evaluation by a physician or other health care provider as soon as verified.  Failure to take appropriate action as a result of a critical value might cause harm or undue suffering for a patient.  A list of critical values is to be made available to each VA facility upon request.
Frozen Section.  A biopsy specimen that is immediately frozen and cut with cryostat; then mounted on a slide, stained, and examined by a pathologist.  Frozen sections provide a rapid diagnosis to the physician during surgery.
Paraffin Block.  A tissue specimen that has been embedded in paraffin wax that the sections can be cut for histologic examination. 
Reference or Referral Laboratory.  The contract laboratory that provides testing, and examination of specimens provided by the medical treatment facility.
Reference Value.  A range of test values expected for a designated population of individuals.
Slides. Glass surface containing biological material to be analyzed.
Specimen.  A body fluid or tissue sample removed for medical examination and analytical testing.
STAT.  A designated category of tests that requires immediate processing to expedite results to physicians handling potentially life-threatening cases.
Surgical Specimen.  A sample or part of an organ or tissue removed during surgery for medical examination and analytical testing.
Tests.  Diagnostic assays to evaluate a patient's physiological condition.
Routine Test - A test that is usually performed at high volume in which the result is required in 24 hours generally.
Specialized Test - A test that is performed in low volume but the technology, expense, or time-consuming nature of each test, is such that some delay is expected.

Statement of Work
A dosimetry program is highly regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Maintaining a dosimetry program requires using a reliable dosimetry processor. Failure to maintain an appropriate dosimetry program and provide individual monitoring devices or equipment could result in severe penalties, lawsuits, fines, and/or the revocation of our permit to use byproduct material under the Master Materials License (MML) issued to the Department of Veterans Affairs by the NRC. Loss of our permit would result in the termination of all Nuclear Medicine Clinic Operations, all other clinical and therapeutic uses of radioactive materials, and the research use of radioactive materials. Penalties and fines could also be levied.
For purposes of this contract, the terms  personnel dosimeter  is an individual monitoring device that requires processing to determine the radiation dose, and that is used by Bay Pines VA Health Care System (BPVAHCS) comply with 10CFR20.1201, with other applicable provisions of Title 10 Chapter 20, or with conditions specified in the license. 
As required by federal law specified in 10CFR20.1501, personnel dosimeters must be processed and evaluated by a dosimetry processor--
(1) Holding current personnel dosimetry accreditation from the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology; and
(2) Approved in this accreditation process for the type of radiation or radiations included in the NVLAP program that most closely approximates the type of radiation or radiations for which the individual wearing the dosimeter is monitored.
Specifications for personnel monitoring services for BPVAHCS are provided herein. Monitoring services are to be provided at the initial setup in the approximate quantities shown below. The contract shall be for a period of one year, with renewal optional for four years. The cost of the contract should be presented in terms of the total annual cost, and expressed as the cost per badge type, according to the number of each badge type. No additional charges will be incorporated or expected, with the exception of non-returned or damaged badges and holders and emergency readings. Credit will be given for all fees assessed for lost/late badges upon return. If personnel monitoring services do not meet specifications, the contract may be terminated by the government.

United States (U.S) Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information & Technology (OIT), Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System for Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories (CART-CL) Services
The purpose of this Source Sought Notice is to search for qualified vendors capable of meeting the requirement for the Clinical Assessment, Reporting, and Tracking System for Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories (CART-CL) Services.  
CART-CL Software and Functionality Description
The CART-CL software collects Cardiology data from 81 VA Cardiology laboratories throughout the entire network of VA hospitals and stores that data into a centrally managed database system located at the Eastern Colorado Heath Care System. Over 7000 providers have used the software to produce more than 600,000 standardized reports on more than 375,000 since its first release in 2003. Data collected by the CART-CL software application is used by the VA to produce reports for inclusion in official patient records, assist with day-to-day clinical operations, provide data for operations and clinical research, measure performance levels of cardiology staff and laboratories, and identify potential problems with devices and procedures. 
CART-CL is a standalone application fully integrated with Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) that enables providers to reuse and annotate existing Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VISTA) and CPRS data, such as vitals, medications, labs and problems, and enter additional discrete and textual data for assessment, diagnostic procedures and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) interventions in the cardiac catheterization lab setting, as well as follow-up notes and information on patient status at the time of discharge. The application automatically creates corresponding assessment, diagnostic procedures, PCI, follow-up, and discharge reports that are uploaded into CPRS and signed in CPRS. The application also tracks the procedures performed and can upload this information into VISTA. The additional data that is not available in VISTA/CPRS is modeled and collected in a standard relational database that can be easily deployed and migrated to any SQL database system. CART-CL is configured to connect via the VA intranet to a single national database server that serves all cardiac catheterization labs. 
The Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA) is developing the application with substantial input from clinicians. This project has been a key element of the VHA Cardiac Care Initiative since its inception. CART-CL was mandated to be a national program for use in all 81 catheterization laboratories in the VA system by the Deputy Undersecretary for Health and is a unique collaborative effort involving Patient Care Services, Office of Information, Office of Quality and Performance, and the Ischemic Heart Disease Quality Enhancement Research Initiative (IHD-QUERI).

Contractor Tasks

The Contractor shall maintain existing CART-CL CATH/PCI applications and databases such that CATH/PCI applications are operational at all installed sites. Programming is done in Delphi and SQL.  Data interfaces which need to be maintained include: VA VistA RPC Broker for access to VistA databases, systems such as the VA Decision Support System (DSS) for workload and costing, and the VA Real-Time Locator Services (RTLS) for supply chain management of products such as devices and supply items used in the VA Cath labs. This includes defect fixes for the applications and the database as well as changes and updates for maintaining compatibility with the underlying VA network operating systems and the VA VISTA/CPRS systems.  Upgrades to the CART-CL CATH/PCI applications and database are defined as being within the scope of the existing CART infrastructure and require no major changes to the underlying architecture and infrastructure. The Contractor shall develop and install enhancements to existing CART CL applications per feedback from the CART Program Director and CART Clinical Advisory subcommittee. This shall include assistance with prioritization of upgrades, developing time and resource estimates for upgrades, implementation and testing of upgrades to the CART CL applications and the database and the deployment of the upgrades to all installed sites. Enhancements to the CART CL applications result from user feedback, VA Policy and Procedure changes, emergent technologies, integration requests with other VA and Department of Defense (DoD) systems, and from standardization efforts by various organizations such as the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JACHO). Enhancements may require changes the existing CART infrastructure. The Contractor shall assist with prioritization of enhancements, develop time and resource estimates, provide trade-off analysis for various enhancement requests, implement and test the enhancements to the CART infrastructure, CART applications and the CART database, and deploy the enhancements to all installed sites.
The Contractor shall be an active participant with the CART Program personnel during regular conference calls and weekly face-to-face meetings with the Program Director and other CART staff, as well as regular 1:1 meetings monthly.  The CART Program Director and personnel will provide the Contractor with the necessary information and instruction on the unique aspects of the project, especially the clinical components, if conventional sources of information are not available.  Guidance will be provided by the Office of Information and Technology with regard to software certification and security. Request for information within the VA, from departments such as the Office of Informatics and Analytics and Patient Care Services shall be required by the contractor.  
The current contract expires on May 15, 2018; therefore the period of performance is anticipated to begin in May 15, 2018. The contract period of performance is 12-month base period, with two 12-month option periods. The Government anticipates a Firm Fixed Price Contract.

Integration of CART-PVI  module
Integration of novel  electronic health system API into CART
Enhancements to CART-EP module, including integration of PROST
Enhancements to CART-PVI module, including integration of PROST
Integration of RTLS into CART-CL procedural reporting
Integration of RTLS into CART-EP procedural reporting

CART-CL Software Salient Characteristics:

The software leverages a powerful object-relational model-driven dynamic late-binding run-time architecture to manage all the internal data, data relationships, report generation, and user inputs
The software uses a configuration specification to provide information about how the application should function to the architecture, allowing changes to be made through a simple specification changes instead of changing the source code associated with the software. 
The software collects data relevant to the VA Cardiology department as identified by industry standards, current research, and VA Clinician feedback on all Cardiology procedures performed in the VA and produces a nationally standardized set of reports for inclusion in patient medical history
The software is tightly integrated with the VISTA/CPRS system and uses it for patient selection, security, data import and data upload. 
The software complies with all the rules, regulations, and security protocols mandated by VA, Federal Law, and health care oversight organizations such as The Joint Commission (JACO) authorized by the VA, and must adjust to any new requirements by any of these organizations within a reasonable timeframe
The software interfaces with the VA s Real Time Locator System (RTLS) and imports information about devices tracked by RTLS that are used during procedures to provide more accurate accounting of devices and reduce the amount of data entry required by users of the application
The software is implemented to permit multiple release versions of the software to operate against the same database. This permits the software upgrade process to happen as each individual hospital approves the update instead of required all sites to update simultaneously
The software facilitates procedure coding by mapping all procedures performed into Clinical Procedure Type (CPT) codes
The software produces a list of problems encountered with devices used so that this information can submitted to the FDA s Device Surveillance program
The software automatically provides alerts when major complications are encountered during procedures and forwards these alerts to a clinical patient safety review team for investigation
The software incorporates feedback from the VA, VA Clinicians, and other end users into the design and implementation of new features
The software provides security roles that limit the scope of the data that users can view and modify and these security roles also limit access to management features that allow each individual software installation to manage their own location s settings and users.
The software uses a sharing and protection mechanism to reuse data elements from previous reports whenever possible to avoid creating duplicated data and to prevent adjustments to shared data
The software logs key user actions and any error messages produced by the application into a database table to facilitate support and maintenance of the application
The software includes specialized graphical controls and control contents that are dynamically generated based on the contents of key reference tables in the database so that changes in reference tables will automatically generate graphical control changes and changes in graphical control content without requiring source code or programming changes.
The software provides the ability to calculate and display health status scores and analytic measurements based on data collected by the software
The software produces a data dictionary based on the internal application model and current application specification that provides a baseline for published data dictionary updates for software users.

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 15pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: ">Headquarters Air Combat Command (HQ ACC) senior leaders seek discussions with industry, academia, and other government organizations to explore emerging technologies with potential applications to combat airpower. While not a request for contractual offers or proposals, these Technical Information Exchange (TIE) discussions may offer organizations currently conducting Independent Research &amp; Development (IR&amp;D) activities the opportunity to exchange insights with Air Force senior leaders and better focus organizational efforts toward Air Force air combat needs in a mutually beneficial manner.<br />The intent of a TIE event is to focus senior-level discussions on IR&amp;D projects or efforts that may prove useful in the employment of combat airpower while also affording participants the opportunity to gain a fuller understanding of the combat air forces' near-, mid-, and far-term capability needs. Successful TIEs generate and sustain an ongoing dialogue on emerging technologies relevant to the ACC core functions between ACC leaders and senior-level participants from industry, academia, FFRDCs, intra-governmental organizations and others. TIEs also provide preliminary opportunities for information exchanges in science, technology and innovation on the participant's current projects that may have the potential to bring advanced capability to warfighters. <br />A general officer or civilian equivalent from the Directorate of Plans, Programs and Requirements (ACC/A5/8/9) will host each TIE session. ACC is the primary provider of air combat forces to America's warfighting commanders and the directorate champions the capability needs for five of the twelve Air Force Core Functions: <strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">Air Superiority; Global Integrated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance; Global Precision Attack; Personnel Recovery; and Command and Control</strong>. </span></p>
