<DESC>The Federal Highway Administration plans to negotiate a Purchase Order with the Roadway Safety Foundation (RSF) to provide a Marketing Plan for Sign and Pavement Marketing Retroflectivity.  RSF will develop a strategic communications and marketing plan to raise general public as well as safety professionals? awareness for minimum retroflectivity levels for signs and pavement markings.  Additionally, RSF will develop a promotional kit of written materials to market retroflectivity.  The marketing plan will serve as a management tool for safety products and technologies; RSF will review retroflectivity program issues, products and provide a marketing plan for the FHWA.  RSF will issue a plan that will coincide with FHWA?s strategic marking plan for deploying safety products that are related to technology that are currently under development through the FHWA resource centers.  The RSF will develop written promotional kits that will be distributed to State and local highway agencies and the motoring public.  The overall program will focus on how retroflectivity enhances nighttime mobility and safety.  Because the Roadway Safety Foundation (RSF) will be supporting, educating, and working directly with the FHWA in promoting public awareness regarding roadway safety in addition to providing enhanced improvements in roadway design and engineering, operations, and protection from roadside hazards which will reduce crashes, injuries, and fatalities; therefore, RSF is the only known source who can provide the marketing services, personnel, products and technology to the highway community for the FHWA.  RSF will be partnering with the FHWA, State and local highway agencies to market their products for roadway safety.  This is a Simplified Acquisition and the anticipated award date is on or about May 9, 2002.

<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission intends to negotiate a contract on a sole source basis with Modeling and Computing Services (M&CS) to provide statistical analysis of problems concerning the materials and mechanical behavior of reactor pressure vessels (RPVs) and technical assistance to the NRC staff in developing the technical basis document for Revision 3 of Regulatory Guide 1.99 and address public comments received after the regulatory guide is published.  The proposed period of performance is 43 months.  The proposed contract is related to work performed by M&CS under Contract No. NRC-04-97-060.  Under this contract, M&CS developed a working embrittlement database and analyzed this database to produce an embrittlement model which was consistent with the current mechanistic understanding of radiation damage in RPV materials.  M&CS also provided updates to the database as required.  The updated database became the basis from which a new embrittlement correlation was developed.  This action is being pursued on a sole source basis because M&CS can provide both this unique database and the expert knowledge and experience of Ernest D. Eason who is the only known expert in advanced statistical analyses, computational techniques, mechanical and materials engineering used to develop the new embrittlement correlation.  In addition, since this proposed effort is for the continued work previously provided by Mr. Eason with M&CS, it is anticipated that award to any other source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the NRC that is not expected to be recovered through competition.  This notice is not to be considered a request for proposals nor a solicitation for offers.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be honored.  Written responses should provide detailed evidence of the respondent's capability to perform the required services and absence of organizational conflict of interest.  See Note 22. *****

<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health, intends to negotiate a contract with Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, on a sole source basis for the completion of a protocol entitled, ?Controlled Dose-Escalation Trial of Intraparenchymally Infused Recombinant Methionyl Human Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor for the Treatment of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.? This protocol is being sponsored by the Division of Intramural Research (DIR), NINDS.  Vanderbilt University Medical Center has a professional staff uniquely qualified by training and prior experience to satisfy the highly specialized demands of this protocol.  The professional staff has, in particular, the expertise in functional and stereotactic neurosurgery for movement disorders which is vital to the success of this protocol.  Vanderbilt has been involved in the execution of this project from the very outset of its initiation and has successfully performed neurosurgical installation of intracranial devices and their connecting systems and pumps as well as experience in administering the experimental drug under the protocol.  Vanderbilt is considered the only source capable to continue and complete the remaining      neurological implant requirements of the protocol.  To do otherwise, would jeopardize the continuity of the study as well as the safety of the patients.  A one-year contract, with up to four option years, utilizing up to ten patients during the five year period, beginning in September 2002, is anticipated.  This organization, by virtue of their preliminary and current work under this protocol, is considered to be the only source that can reasonably provide the prerequisite knowledge, skilled personnel, surgical experience and expertise for performance of this proposed acquisition pursuant to 41 USC 253?(1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  The inherent duplication of cost and performance delays that would be incurred and associated with considering other sources are unacceptable to the Government.  This is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  See Note 22*****

<DESC>NASA/KSC intends to contract on a sole-source basis for gaseous nitrogen requirements (GN2) at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), located on the Atlantic Coast of East Central Florida.  The required GN2 must meet or exceed MIL-PRF-27401D, Type I, Grade B.  The approximate quantity of GN2 required per year is 1,800,000 thousand standard cubic feet (MCF). The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source, and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The incumbent contractor is Air Liquide America Corporation of Houston, Texas.  Air Liquide operates an air separation facility adjacent to KSC that feeds into the KSC/CCAFS GN2 pipeline system.  Portions of the pipeline are owned by Air Liquide and the government, respectively.  Air Liquide is the identified sole source for this contract. NASA expects to award a contract to commence on July 1, 2002, with a 3-year basic period of performance and 2 one-year option periods.  The government will consider offers from sources other than Air Liquide.  It is assumed that any source other than Air Liquide would require at least 1 to 2 years to construct the necessary infrastructure (on-site or near-site) to supply GN2 into the pipeline.  The government will consider making sufficient government property available for a contractor to build the necessary facilities to supply GN2 into the government-owned portion of the pipeline for a subsequent contract.   The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. An Ombudsman has been appointed, See NASA Specific Note "B".

<CONTACT>Mark Melendez, 405-954-8071
<DESC>Financial & Materiel Management Systems & Procedures Enhancement <P>  OVERVIEW: The Federal Aviation Administration Logistics Center (FAALC) intends to award a contract to Logistics Management Institute (LMI) of McLean, VA.  This consulting services requirement will be processed under single source procedures in support of the Logistics Center’s continuing effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Materiel Resource Planning (MRP) process.  It will utilize a variety of skills, such as Project Leader, Senior Consultant, Consultant, Administrative Assistant, and Senior Management.  The contract will be for one base, plus two option years. <P> BACKGROUND: This contracted action will be the last of a three-phase revolving fund implementation plan to correct and improve major MRP deficiencies.  One of the primary missions of the FAALC is to buy and repair spare parts needed to support the National Airspace System (NAS).  A summary of the first two LMI contracted phases accomplished, and the last contemplated phase is outlined below. <P> &#61623; Phase 1 was completed during fiscal year 2000.  During this phase, efforts were focused on consumable item demand and forecasting and ordering policies leading to recommendations to correct current Materiel Requirements Planning (MRP) review point implementation.  A retrospective supply simulation was developed to emulate Logistics Center consumable item management processes and to evaluate different methodologies of demand forecasting.  Phase 1 identified 14 separate improvements to the MRP processes and systems. <P> &#61623; Phase 2 was focused on development of formal policy and procedures for computing levels of infrequently demanded and reparable items and was completed during fiscal year 2001.  To date, this effort has resulted in the development of greatly enhanced processes for calculating expendable item buy requirements, and formal policies and procedures for computing inventory levels for infrequently demanded items.  Improved forecasting methodologies for purchase actions, and repair requirements for Exchange and Repair (E&R) items were also enhanced.  The supply simulator developed during Phase 1 was further developed to emulate the Logistics Center processes for E&R items. <P> &#61623; Phase 3 is intended to further develop and extend the findings of Phases 1 and 2.  The need for development of MRP performance metrics has been identified, which will lead to improved customer satisfaction and lower operating costs.  Extensive measurement tools and establishment of goals and objectives are also to be developed and determined through use of the supply simulation. <P> LMI has gained detailed knowledge of the FAA and the unique FAALC processes, therefore it has been determined it would be cost and time prohibitive for a new contractor to attain the level of understanding and support that will be required under this contract.  The final analysis to single source with LMI is based upon the need to maintain the continuity, and integrity for the specified services. <P> This announcement is for informational purposes only, not a request for proposals.

<SUBJECT>B--Southwestern Willow Flycatcher Studies, Lower Colorado Regional Office
<SOLNBR>02SP300093
<CONTACT>Beth Murray Contract Specialist 7022938581;
<DESC>This is full and open competition.  The NAICS is 54171. The purpose of this study is to monitor the status of the southwestern willow flycatcher in suitable and/or historical riparian and wetland habitats along the LCR. Historically, a substantial number of willow flycatcher may have existed in areas along the LCR (Brown 1902). One of the major factors for the decline of willow flycatchers along the LCR has been habitat changes within riparian systems. Objectives of the study are to document the presence/absence of southwestern willow flycatchers along the Lower Colorado River; determine the breeding status of the flycatcher; determine nesting success including causes of nest failures, major nest predators, and effects of parasitism; and determine habitat suitability of all survey sites along the Lower Colorado River including the relative importance of native, mixed, and non-native dominated habitats.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Notice is No. AB1330-02-RP-00064.  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 97-25.  NOAA, National Marine Fisheries Services requires the following acquisition Line Item, to study the Stellar Sea Lion population decline: (1) Satellite-Linked Data Recorder W/SDR-T16 for a total of 85 units.  Delivery schedule for data recorders: 25 units by October 25, 2003; 30 units by January 25, 2003, and the remaining 30 units delivered by April 26, 2003.  Specifications for Satellite-Linked Data Recorders: 1/4 watt SDR-T16; 2XC batteries with approximately 60,000 transmissions.  Transmit only when dry using a conductivity sensor to determine whether the antenna is clear of water before transmitting. The SDR-T16 may be programmed to suspend transmissions after the animal has "hauled-out" for a user-defined number of hours.  Ability to limit transmissions to hours when the satellite is likely to be in view, limit the maximum number of transmissions per day, and duty-cycle.  Data collection: The SDRs are to be preprogramed to sample depth every 10 seconds. Depth range: 500m. Histograms: the dive data is compressed into histograms for transmission.  The SDR-T16 will transmit up to three different types of histograms; dive-maximum-depth (depth histogram); dive duration (duration histogram) and time spent within a specified depth range or hauled-out (time-at-depth histogram).  A time line message will cover a 24-hour period (midnight to midnight).  The instrument will include status messages for SDR's battery voltage, number of transmissions sent, current zero-pressure offset, current time according to the SDR's internal clock, current seawater conductivity and maximum depth reading over the last 24 hours.  Analysis software will be provided free of charge. The inability of NMFS to obtain the oceanographic equipment necessary to meet the Government's responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act and Marine Mammal Protection Act would prevent NMFS's Recovery Team from identifying critical scientific information and analysis in the development of a Stellar Sea Lion Recovery Plan.  Therefore, it is in the best interest of the Government to award this contract to Wildlife Computers on a sole source basis, because of their extensive experience in manufacturing these instruments.  The proposal shall be prepared in accordance with FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offers - Commercial Items, and the offer shall include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  FAR clause 52.212.4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items, apply to this acquisition and there are no addenda to this provision.  FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statues or Executive Order - Commercial Items is applicable.  Include the additional clauses 52.222-21; 52.222-26; 52.222-35; 52.22-36; 52.222-37; 52.223-9 (Alt. 1); 52.232.34; CAR 1352.201-70.  This is a firm fixed price contract. The proposal from Wildlife Computers must be received no later than 4:00 P.M., Pacific Time, May 14, 2002.  Full text of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) can be accessed on the Internet at www.arnet.gov/far.

<DESC>The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) intends to award a sole source contract to Aeromet Corporation for the design, development and evaluation of an Airborne Infrared Surveillance (AIRS) capability in support of the MDA Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) Program.  The Aeromet evaluation will include determining the potential military capabilities of the Heimdall sensor suite presently mounted on the High Altitude Observatory (HALO) II aircraft; the AIRS functions will be supported by the Heimdall sensor suite to emulate the collection of infrared surveillance data using U.S. test activities and through the downlink of simulated fire control solutions to interceptor platforms.  The required support consists of detailed engineering evaluations, design, minor modifications, and experiments and demonstrations for the HALO II aircraft and its support equipment.  There are no other known sources capable of providing this development and evaluation effort required by MDA. Aeromet, the present operator of the HALO II aircraft, was competitively awarded the contract to design, fabricate and integrate the Heimdall sensor suite and operate the HALO II aircraft.  No other source has the current requisite unique technical expertise and demonstrated capabilities to operate the HALO II aircraft during MDA data collection missions nor the experience with the Heimdall sensor suite.  Delays associated in obtaining this capability from another source would negatively impact MDA's ability to comply with the Congressional mandate for evaluating the AIRS system.  The estimated cost for the evaluation of the AIRS system is $5.6M during the 12-month period of June 2002, through June 2003.  See Note 22.*****                            

Note 22.   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is R05-7MN1-02 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  The NAICS is 334516, business size 500 employees.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-06.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Conservation & Production Research Laboratory requests the procurement of (one) Carbon/Nitrogen/Sulfur (CN) Analyzer.  Minimum specifications include: 1)  The elemental analyzer must be capable of simultaneous determination of carbon and nitrogen by combusting the sample and measuring concentrations in the entire contents of the evolved combustion gases.  2)  The system must employ electronic mass flow controllers for the regulation of the helium carrier gas and oxygen combustion gas.  3)  The system must employ a single thermal conductivity detector and analyze all of the analyte gasses resulting from combustion without the utilization of a gas splitting system. This is an important consideration since gas splitting systems and associated ballast chambers increase the likelihood of system leaks and can dramatically increase  maintenance requirements.  4)  The system must be able to measure from 0.02 mg to 150 mg absolute nitrogen and from 0.02 to 400 mg absolute carbon.  5)  The system must be capable of handling the following sample sizes: Soils up to 1.5 g, moist manure samples up to 0.5 g, plant tissue up to 5 cubic centimeters in size, and liquid samples up to 4 ml in volume. Large sample sizes are important for our applications since it considerably reduces sample preparation time and reduces the number of required replications. The system must be able to analyze moist samples.  6)  The system must have a 60 position or greater automatic sample loading device, capable of handling both solid or liquid samples. Sampling device must remove the ash from the analysis after each sample.  7)  The system must include all software required for the operation of the instrument by an external PC operating in Windows 98 or higher.  8)  The system must employ a combustion tube made from stainless steel to eliminate the possibility of breakage due to thermal shock in the case of a power outage.  9)  The system must be supplied with gas regulators, tubing, and electronic balance required for operation. The cost for these accessories and any other required accessories must be included in the total bid amount.  10)  The system must include installation and training by a factory trained representative and be covered by at least a 12-month parts and labor warranty.  Alternative Bid Specifications: Include capability for analysis of sulfur in addition to carbon and nitrogen. In addition to the specifications above: 1)  Capable of simultaneous determination of the elements in carbon and nitrogen (CN mode) or carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (CNS mode), by combusting the sample and measuring the entire contents of nitrogen, carbon, and sulfur in the combustion gasses.  2)  Sulfur is analyzed using a thermal conductivity detector.  3)  In the CNS mode the system must be able to analyze solids for  0.02 to 30 mg absolute nitrogen, 0.02 to 200 mg absolute carbon, and from 0.02 to 15 mg absolute sulfur.  4)  Must be able to accommodate a quartz combustion tube when in the CNS mode to permit combustion at higher temperatures.  The contractor shall perform all delivery, set-up and training so that the CN/CNS Analyzer is complete and ready to use.  The CN/CNS Analyzer shall be delivered to the USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Conservation & Production Research Laboratory, 2300 Experiment Station Rd, Bushland, TX 79012.

<DESC>NA GENERAL REQUIREMENTS The system must be an industrial FTIR gas analyzer capable of continuous unattended operation.  It must be capable of extractive gas sampling and analysis under EPA protocols.  It must be a sampling system to pull atmospheric air from at least eight and pr eferably up to 16 sample ports with automated valve and data collection control.  The system must be capable of detecting all known chemical warfare agents when properly configured and calibrated.   TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS Analyzer The spectrometer must be capable of resolution up to 0.5cm-1 .  The instrument must be equipped with a high sensitivity MCT detector, cryogenically cooled via mechanical means.  The instrument must have a non-hygroscopic ZnSe optics for the operating envir onment.  We require a scan velocity of 2 scans/sec at 0.5cm-1 for adequate resolution and sensitivity.  The Analyzer must have onboard signal processing via dual ADC.   The system must have the ability to interface to the current computer network currently  used by the USACE.  The system’s interferometer must be capable of operating in any environmental conditions.  The system must be able to operate for a minimum of 20 minutes in the event of power loss without the need for a manual restart.  Sampling System The FTIR spectrometer and all sampling components must be housed in a stainless steel enclosure with a NEMA rating.  The requirement is for a system in which cooling water is used for system stability.  The system must pull air samples sequentially through  from 8 (16 optional) individual sample ports using stainless steel hardware and independent flow control for each sample line.  The requirement is for a heated 10-meter White Gas cell with nickel coated body and gold-coated mirrors.  The gas cell and samp le lines must be automatically purged with dry air after each sample collection cycle.  The sampling system must be fully programmable to allow for group sampling and reduced detection time.  There must be an automated routine calibration cycle using a sur rogate gas to provide comprehensive system status checks.  We require on-site method development and system optimization from the vendor. Software The data system for the analyzer must be a integrated, Windows 2000 based PC which is Y2K compliant.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

General Services Administration, Federal Technology (GSA/FTS), Region 5 is announcing its intent to award this procurement as a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial products and services. This notice is prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 and supplemented with additional information included herein. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. Proposals are being requested. A written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is issued as a request for proposal (RFP); solicitation number GS05T02BMM2805, which incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2001-6. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code 541511 applies. Size standard is $21 Million. This requirement is to provide technical support for the development of some initial implementations of MOVES; the contractor shall provide software development support services. Background: As part of the Office of Air and Radiation, EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ) administers portions of Title II of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 and 1990.  Within OTAQ, the Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) does a wide range of work in support of EPA's efforts in air quality analysis.  These efforts include creating and revising emissions estimation tools, developing regulatory impact analyses, testing vehicles, supporting the vehicle inspection and maintenance programs, and other related projects. OTAQ's current series of air emission estimation models are based on MOBILE6:  MOBILE6.0 - A basic version of the model used to estimate emissions of HC, CO, and NOx.  MOBILE6.1 An enhanced version of MOBILE to estimate emissions of particulate matter, gaseous SO2, and ammonia. MOBILE6.2 - A version of MOBILE enhanced to estimate emissions of a variety of air toxic compounds. MOBILE6.3 - A version of MOBILE enhanced to estimate emissions of the "green-house" gas CO2.  Estimation of CO2 implies that this version of MOBILE will also estimate vehicle fuel economy. Additional conceptual software design work has been undertaken including: Top-Level documentation of the approximately 20 "Use Cases" the new generation of mobile source models is intended to eventually fulfill.  A partial, preliminary software design as represented in "NGM Object Oriented Design" revision 5 of which was produced by Cimulus, Inc on November 30, 2001.  This design focuses on the "core" vehicle activity and emission result calculation aspects of the model in a generic fashion. A top-level identification of the software classes and graphical user interface (gui) characteristics that would be needed to fully support the use cases. (This information is available in documents entitled EPA's plan is to design and code MOVES in-house with contractor assistance.  MOVES represent EPA's collective integrated knowledge of mobile source emissions.  The process of designing and coding MOVES is primarily a process of assembling, evaluating, integrating, and rigorously formalizing our understanding of mobile source emissions.  This is a process that only EPA can undertake.   EPA can, however, contract for assistance with the nuts and bolts of software design and coding.  This contract is intended to provide EPA with that assistance. EPA's software development paradigm is iterative.  We plan to program one use case at a time, and add functionality with each release.  The advantage is that we are not wasting time and money designing things that will have radically changed by the time we get to them.  The risk is that a near-term programming decision may interfere with the future coding of a use case that we have not adequately designed for.  We minimize that risk by creating a high-level overall design that includes everything we expect to develop and be flexible.  We design in detail only the next release.  That way, we do not spend too much time on things that will change anyway, but we lower our risk of having trouble doing something that we want to do later.  The risk is additionally lowered by the practice of refactoring (reworking code as needed).  Refactoring, in turn, is supported by the concurrent development and maintenance of test suites for all classes, packages, and the program as a whole.  Description: The objective of this project is to provide technical support for the development of some initial implementations of MOVES.  This technical support has four objectives: 1.  Help EPA/OTAQ to complete, document, and operate an initial "infrastructure" for development of the MOVES software and to advise EPA/OTAQ regarding the further evolution of this infrastructure to meet the needs of the MOVES project as it progresses. 2.  Work with EPA to produce a software design for MOVES which: 3.  Use the MOVES design and the software development infrastructure to produce and test initial implementations of the new generation model.  4.  Advise, assist, and provide training to OTAQ staff regarding software development tools and methods. All work to be performed by the contractor will be defined in greater detail in particular "task descriptions" to be issued to the contractor by EPA.   The goal of each individual task is to produce the deliverables it requires within the schedule contained in its task description or task plan.  Skills and Expertise: The Contractor shall provide technical expertise for the development of computer modeling software. The Contractor shall provide expertise in object-oriented system analysis and design, object-oriented software development and testing, and in producing clear documentation.  The Contractor shall provide staff familiar with the goals and preliminary MOVES design, appropriate functional skills including: management of complicated, multi-part tasks; scientific system software design; programming in Java, SQL-based Data Base Management Software, C++, and software documentation.  The Contractor shall identify key personnel to perform the technical work described in this SOW.  These personnel will be committed to the project for its duration and shall not be substituted or replaced without written agreement of the Client Representative.  Deliverables:  The Contractor shall provide software development support services for the Assessment and Standards Division (ASD) of the Office of Transportation and Air Quality.  Work shall be performed off-site. Generally, EPA shall request work products by means of formal task descriptions, which shall delineate specific objectives, deliverables, and constraints including priority indicators and completion dates.  Actual task descriptions will be issued following contract award.  The specific format and structure may vary by task at EPA discretion.  Within two working days of receipt of a task description the Contractor shall inform the Client Representative and Technical Contact that the Contractor accepts the task description as written, or shall provide the Client Representative and Technical Contact with a written request for changes in the task description or delivery date.  EPA shall consider such Contractor requests and revise the work order as EPA judges necessary.  Whether or not the work order is revised, the Contractor shall be responsible for delivering all end items specified in accepted task description by the task completion date.  All deliverables must be of professional quality and must meet the requirements set forth in this SOW and in the specific task description.  The contractor shall work within the "software development infrastructure" described above and shall comply with its requirements.    The Contractor shall provide all source code and data tables used to develop specific applications.  All products developed under this task order are the property of the Environmental Protection Agency.  In addition to the deliverables required by individual task descriptions, this statement of work requires the following deliverables: During the execution of task assignments the Contractor shall conduct a meeting in person every week, or more often if necessary, with the EPA Technical Contacts.  The Contractor shall provide EPA with a weekly oral report on Contractor activity and progress, including any issues to be resolved and any actual or forecast variances against work order commitments, and options for resolution of these variances. The contractor shall begin each task with the latest possible version of the MOVES software and provide EPA with updated copies of the source code on at least a weekly basis, identifying the version of the model, which was the basis for the changes, and the modules (including automated tests) added, changed and deleted relative to that version.  As defined by particular tasks deliverables will typically include tests designed to insure that the code functions as required. Special Instructions: GSA through its Client Agency Client Representative shall perform Management of this project.  A Client Representative shall be established for all government and Contractor meetings, technical guidance and product deliverables.  The Client Representative shall identify EPA Technical Contacts capable of providing the Contractor with technical assistance and clarification required for the performance of specific tasks.  The Contractor shall initiate work on this project by meeting with key Client Agency Representatives to insure a common understanding of the requirement, expectations, and ultimate end products.  The Contractor shall discuss the overall understanding of the project and review the background information and materials provided by the client.  Discussions shall also include the scope of work, deliverables to be produced, how the efforts shall be organized and the project conducted, assumptions made, and expected end results.  A concerted effort shall be made to gain a thorough understanding of the Client Agency expectations.  However, nothing discussed in this or in any subsequent meetings or discussions between the client and the Contractor shall be construed as adding, deleting, or modifying any Task Order requirements, including deliverable specifications and due dates.

<DESC>Space and Missile System Center, Detachment 12, Space Test Program, Kirtland Air Force Base, NM is contemplating negotiating a sole source contract with Spectrum Astro, Incorporated (SAI), Gilbert, Arizona.  This procurement will provide Coriolis post on-orbit operations support. The contractor shall provide needed documentation, training, and support to operate the SAI-built Coriolis space vehicle from the Research, Development, Test & Evaluation Support Center (RSC) at Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico and provide support for on-orbit test and checkout of the Coriolis space vehicle, for resolution of anomalies, investigation support in the event of a mission failure and for the conduct of required satellite operations for up to one year using the Air Force Satellite Control Network (AFSCN) via the RSC. The Contractor shall provide the Government command and telemetry specifications, data formats, conversions, calibrations, space vehicle operations information, readiness information, training, and required training materials.  The period of performance shall begin at the conclusion of Coriolis on-orbit checkout (L+30 days).  Using the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c) (1), pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii), the Space Test Program anticipates that this effort will be available only from the original source (SAI).  This is predicated upon substantial duplication of cost to the Government, which is not expected to be recovered through competition. Spectrum Astro has designed the Coriolis Spacecraft and is responsible for integration, test and on-orbit checkout and has the requisite experience and knowledge of the Coriolis spacecraft and is therefore the only company that can provide the Space Test Program with total system accountability.  Spectrum Astro is the on-going contractor for the Coriolis Mission.  Interested offerors should submit a statement of capability that convincingly demonstrates that continuity and mission success will not be compromised and that post on-orbit support will not be sacrificed without the use of this proprietary spacecraft design.  Any firm which believes it possess the above technical expertise is encouraged to give written notification to the Contracting Officer.  Supporting evidence must be furnished, in sufficient detail to demonstrate possession of the requisite technical expertise.  Written letters, including corporate interest, capabilities and relevant experience (not to exceed 10 pages), should be addressed to Ms Maria Aurora Vigil, 3548 Aberdeen Ave SE, Kirtland AFB NM 87117-5778 by close of business May 13, 2002.  Foreign firms are advised that they will not be allowed to participate in this acquisition as a prime contractor.  An Ombudsman, Mr William Orzech, has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition.  The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns and issues. The Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Potential Offerors should communicate first with the Contracting Officer to request information, pose a question, and voice concerns before contacting the Ombudsman.  In those instances where Offerors cannot obtain resolution from the Contracting Officer, they are invited to contact Mr. William Orzech at (310) 363-0886. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS.  The anticipated award date will be on or about June 2002.  For contracting issues, please contact SMC Det12/PKT, Maria Aurora Vigil at (505) 846-8543.  For technical questions, contact Major Kevin Benedict, kevin.benedict@kirtland.af.mil, (505) 846-8723.

<DESC>USPS SEEKING SOURCES - The United States Postal Service's (USPS) Corporate Contact Management (CCM) program seeks to implement a comprehensive turn-key contact center network solution that reduces costs, increases efficiencies and improves customer care through enterprise consolidation and integration of the disparate services, technologies, and communications providers throughout its various customer contact centers.  Increased operating efficiency focuses on the combination of processes and technology that maximizes the value of the contact center solution.  Improvement in enterprise customer care focuses on the channel-integrated quality of current contact handling services and the channel-integrated development of future revenue enhancing ones for USPS products.

This solution will minimize overall contact center program cost by enabling the USPS to gain economies of scale, maximize use of current internet technologies, and streamline enterprise customer care through deployment of a consistent customer contact platform.  It should also provide for revenue generating opportunities through potential strategic partnerships with contact center industry leaders and improvement in customer satisfaction as industry knowledge and best practices are leveraged across the entire contact center channel. Through comprehensive replacement and intelligent reconfiguration, this solution will best transform the USPS existing call management infrastructure into a 21st century contact management infrastructure that is synchronized and integrated with USPS Customer Relationship Management (CRM) processes and systems across toll-free, email, Web or other customer communication channels.

CCM seeks to pre-qualify suppliers who can propose and execute a plan that seamlessly consolidates and streamlines the current USPS call center network (71.5 million annual contacts) into a fully integrated and managed "contact" center network.   A comprehensive competitive solicitation will allow for overall network reconfiguration and resizing that minimize labor market costs and offers strategic partnerships with one or more contact center service suppliers.  In addition, this solicitation provides for the complete outsourcing of all contact center technology infrastructure systems as well as its integration, implementation, and management to the same contact center supplier(s). This includes, but is not limited to enterprise contact center software, network IVR services, and private VoIP network deployments.

FREEMARKETS, Inc. - The firm FreeMarkets will be facilitating this effort. FreeMarkets is the leading global provider of e-sourcing software and service solutions, and operates the world?s largest sourcing market. Through its unique combination of industry-leading, web-based software, in-depth supply market information, market operations and expert sourcing services, FreeMarkets has helped customers around the world source more than $25 billion in goods and services in more than 190 different supply verticals.

REQUIRED SUPPLIER CRITERIA AND OTHER INFORMATION - The USPS intends to pre-qualify respondents capable of providing an innovative and commercially available Contact Center Network Solution(s). Respondents included in any subsequent pre-qualified group may be invited to participate in follow-up pre-qualification processes, a discovery process or to provide proposals in response to the USPS Request for Proposal.  However, the USPS reserves the right to terminate this process if it is deemed that the availability or maturity of the commercial solutions does not fit the current need or vision of the USPS.  Responding to this notice does not guarantee pre-qualification or participation in future USPS activities.

<DESC>This announcement provides an update to the Sources Sought CBD announcements of 16 January 2001 and 14 March 2001 (Ref. #N00024-01-R-5165).  The Cooperative Engagement Capability (CEC) program still plans a full and open best value competition to develop, produce and field CEC requirements, which will include equipment design and development of a future CEC software baseline. The combined effort will be identified as CEC Block 2.  The competition will be conducted in FY03 with an award expected in FY04.  The earlier announcements indicated a second competition for a CEC Systems Engineering and Integration Agent (SE/IA).  The Navy no longer plans to compete the SE/IA function and it will be performed by a government activity.  CEC Block 2 is expected to be an advanced sensor netting system that preserves the capability demonstrated in the CEC Block 1 OPEVAL, but provides cost, performance, and functional improvements.  Notional Block 2 characteristics are expected to include: (1) compliance with evolutionary requirement of the CEC Operational Requirement Document (ORD); (2) potential growth to multi-service applications including compliance with applicable Joint Capstone Requirements Documents; (3) efficient bandwidth utilization; (4) focus on open network architecture to expand sensor netting track data availability to meet a variety of warfighter needs on a variety of platforms (i.e., ships, aircraft, land sites and vehicles); (5) anti-tamper capabilities; (6) compatibility with legacy combat systems; and (7) compliance with Joint Technical Architecture.  Projected benefits include reduced cost, size, and weight.  More details about Block 2 requirements and competition will be provided in the fall of 2002.  Interested parties in the CEC Block 2 competition are requested to e-mail another expression of interest by 31 May 2002 to:  MURRAYJM@NAVSEA.NAVY.MIL.  This expression of interest should contain a single point-of-contact and include mailing address, telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address for said point-of-contact.  Additional details of the planned competition may be directly issued to those interested parties.  Only one point-of-contact per company is requested.  Furthermore, the response should reference Sources Sought Announcement N00024-02-R-5116.*****

<CONTACT>Betty Whitley, Contract Specialist, Phone 803-725-3069, Fax 803-725-8573, Email betty.whitley@srs.gov
<DESC>This is a special notice issued by Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), management and operating contractor for the U.S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site near Aiken, South Carolina.  WSRC wishes to determine public interest in licensing for commercial applications a novel method of creating in situ metal peroxides, which slowly release oxygen in a soluble form in aqueous environments. 

The new approach to the clean up of groundwater containing organic and/or inorganic contaminants involves the creation of in situ oxygen reservoirs.  This continuous release of oxygen creates oxidative conditions sufficient to promote the growth of microbial agents and to precipitate certain contaminants. 

Naturally released, soluble oxygen provides a critical nutrient for aerobic microbes useful in treating many types of organic contaminants.  This method may be of particular use for controlling oxidation states required for redox reactions.  This controlled release of oxygen should increase the efficiency of treating groundwater contaminated with redox-sensitive metals that are mobile under reducing conditions.  For other metals, such as chromium and uranium, the presence of oxygen will enhance mobility.  By using known extraction techniques, these solubilized metals can then be extracted from groundwater for treatment. 

For groundwater contaminated by acid mine drainage or coal pile runoff, the continuous supply of oxygen creates an environment in which ferrous iron is converted to ferric iron.  In its ferric state, iron is very effective in co-precipitating a number of contaminating metals.  The precipitated metals are immobilized and will not be transported to downstream water sources. 

WSRC has filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty application for this invention. 

For more information on the In Situ Generation of Oxygen-Releasing Metal Peroxides for Environmental Remediation and licensing opportunities, contact Joseph P. Dugan via telephone at (803) 725-0848 or (800) 228-3843; via Fax at (803) 725-4988; via email at joseph.dugan@srs.gov; or via mail at Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #243, Aiken, SC  29808.  Responses to this notice should be received by May 24, 2002.  This is not a request for a formal subcontract; it is a request for interested parties and licensing opportunities only.

<DESC>This is a notice to modify an existing contract with Delta Oceanographics for submersible dive days.  The sole source requirement is for the charter of a submersible and support vessel to conduct a yelloweye rockfish survey.  The area to be surveyed will be the untrawlable portion of the US-Vancouver IMPFC area.  The current research is duplication of historical surveys and the DELTA submersible was used in prior studies.  It is therefore essential to the integrity of the research to duplicate the equipment utilized.  Several cooperating federal and state agencies, universities, and laboratories along the West Coast utilize the Delta.  The collection of coast wide data utilizing the same equipment for research maintains continuity throughout the research area.  Charter period shall be for a total of 10 dive days in August of 2002 and 2003.  See Note 22.  For additional information contact Kristina Rodabaugh at (206) 526-6379.
