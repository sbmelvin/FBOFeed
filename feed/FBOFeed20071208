<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to solicit proposals for a contractor to fulfill a requirement for a program titled Economic Studies on Impact of FDA Regulations.
Activities under the proposed contract will include, although not necessarily be limited to the following: (1) Methods Development - while the economic impact of certain FDA regulatory actions can be analyzed via an established methodology, other FDA initiatives will require novel analytical approaches to evaluate potential effects of economic impacts on consumers, the agency, and the regulated industry. (2) Baseline Measurement - The FDA needs baseline data on the economic characteristics of regulated industries in order to estimate economic impact. These data may include the number and size of firms and the employment, sales, and number of stock keeping units (labels). In many instances, industry profile studies will require supporting documentation for OMB survey clearance procedures. (3) Impact Assessments - Since the FDA is required to prepare comprehensive Economic Impact Analysis for significant regulations under Executive Order 12866, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the expected impact of each agency rule must be reviewed to determine whether or not it will be considered significant. Both significant and non-significant assessments require extensive familiarity with numerous aspects of the regulated industries. A majority of these analyses require a high level of specialized and technical expertise and must withstand intense technical review and scrutiny. 

It is anticipated that one (1) contract will be awarded with a one (1) year base period and 4 option years. FDA intends to solicit this requirement as a full and open competitive requirement. This announcement is not a request for proposal (RFP). FDA anticipates release of the RFP on or around December 31, 2007 and it will be available on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. The anticipated award date for this effort is on or before June 1, 2008.

<RESPDATE>121407
<ARCHDATE>01132008
<CONTACT>Diane Brazale Contract Specialist 414-902-5403
<DESC>The Great Lakes Acquisition Center (GLAC) intends to negotiate a sole source contract with Landauer of Glenwood IL to provide, process, and evaluate aluminum oxide whole-body dosimeters for the Jesse Brown VAMC, Chicago, IL.  This requirement shall be for a base plus three (3) option renewal periods.  The OSL Dosimeters and the testing/analysis shall meet the most recent NVLAP standards for the assessment of x- ray, gamma, and beta doses at levels of 1 millirad or less. This procurement is being conducted in accordance FAR 6.302, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. NAICS codes applicable include 339112 and 541380. To the best of our knowledge, the Landauer Company, as the manufacturer of the OSL Dosimeters is the only vendor who can provide these devices that will meet the needs of this facility.  In addition to vendor-read dosimeters, a dosimetry system must be provided that is capability of being read on-site or in the field that can be re-analyzed by the dosimetry service to provide for NVLAP certified dosimetry results.  Dosimeters should be able to be worn for up to one year without loosing dosimetry information, must be unaffected by heat, moisture, and pressure, and have a sensitivity of at least 1 mrem.  System shall allow for multiple employer total exposure reports that include dosimetry information from the existing JBVAMC affiliate hospitals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes.  No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted.  However, any firm that believes it can meet the requirements may give written notification to the Contracting Office by the response due date. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Information can be sent to the Contracting Officer via e-mail at diane.brazale@va.gov, or via fax to (414) 902-5440. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. If no responses are received, the GLAC will proceed with the sole source negotiation with Landauer.
