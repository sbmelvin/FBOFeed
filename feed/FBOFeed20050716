<DESC>ACA  The Americas, Mission Support Division has a requirement to support the continued operations of the Personnel Recovery Center located at the USARSO HQ in building 1000.  ACA  The Americas intends to issue a modification of contract W912CL-05-D -0001 on a sole source basis to incorporate the requirements of the USARSO Recovery Center (currently performed by TATE Inc on a contract through another Agency).  W912CL-05-D-0001 was competitively awarded to TATE Inc. on 27 Apr 2005 and the instant requi rement is within scope of this contract.  TATE Inc. is currently performing these tasks for USARSO and it would take a substantial duplication of time and money for another company to offer a similar product.  Further, these reprocurement costs are not exp ected to be recovered through competition.  The existing contract will be terminated early to allow transition of the USARSO Personnel Recovery Center to W912CL-05-D-0001.  Performance is to begin on or about 11 September 2005.  All questions and comments regarding the solicitation should be addressed in writing to the Contract Specialist and the Contracting Officer identified in this synopsis.

<DESC>Source Sought FEDBIZOPS Announcement Sources Sought for Support: Open Source Intelligence Support to IO. Title: Open Source Intelligence Support to IO. The NAICS code is 541511, and the size standard is $21MM.  THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Defense Contracting Command-Washington (DCC-W), in support of the             Office of the Secretary of Defense, is conducting a market survey in accordance with FAR 10.0001 to determine the extent of Small Business participation and capability to perform the requirement summarized below and in accordance with the statement of work .  Here follows the performance-based work statement: PERFORMANCE BASED WORK STATEMENT(U) Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Support to Information Operations 1.0  Background:  The Information Operations (IO) Directorate in the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Warfighting Support (ODUSD(IWS)/IO) oversees Department of Defense (DoD) IO capabilities.  In the past ten years, ever y Commission and Congressional report concerning Intelligence Reform has recommended greater use of and investment in open sources, both in production of stand-alone products and as a baseline for the other intelligence disciplines.  During this time, OSIN T has evolved from its very narrowly defined niche of news services and foreign media collection and exploitation to encompass all media sources, commercial imagery, polling data, subject matter experts, gray literature, and a myriad of other publicly avai lable sources.  The internet and its associated technologies have exploded across the advanced industrial, commercialized world.  Very quickly, the amount of information available in Open Sources on so-called Third World countries and the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) working within them has proliferated.  Subsequently, Open Sources are well positioned to provide actionable information against hard targets, particularly in the context of intelligence deficiencies in the trans-national areas of terro rism and nonproliferation.  2.0  Objective:  The objective is to develop a repeatable capability for capturing relevant Open Source information about hard-target adversary elite structure and elite decision-making processes, and exploiting such information for the purpose of increasi ng Combatant Commanders unambiguous warning, as well as positively affecting their operational options. 3.0  Scope of Work:  The personnel required throughout the period of performance shall be determined based upon the task.
