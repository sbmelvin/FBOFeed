The modification will add contractor effort resulting from an addition of Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Data Item Description (DID) as a Contract Data Requirement List (CDRL) to the existing contracts. This source data shall contain essential information that is used by the Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV) to develop, test, validate and publish joint service non-nuclear EEOD 60-series technical manuals. EOD technicians shall use this data in support of testing, development and operational evaluation of the HTVSF. As the HTVSF JCTD contracts are being performed under a rolling down-select process, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only the contractors cited above under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(iii). Interested parties must have rights to the technical data package(s) for the HTVSF(s) or a signed agreement with the HTVSF contractor(s) to permit sufficient access to the fuze systems design(s). Responses to this synopsis should be submitted for receipt by the Government within 15 days of the publication date and must state whether the potential source is a small business concern IAW FAR 52.219-1. Responders to this synopsis will not be provided the results of the Government evaluation of their qualifying package. The NAICS Code/Size Standards is 332993/1500 employees. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. Interested sources should contact Ms. Robin Gibson, Contract Specialist, 850-883-0263 or Steve Wall, Contracting Officer, 850-883-0844. For technical information, contact Ms. Missy Ward, Program Manager, 850-883-0920. Collect calls will not be accepted. An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns from offerors and potential offerors.

When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or source selection process. Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting Officer, Contract Specialist, or Program Manager.

The original equipment was manufactured by Westinghouse Hydroelectric, and Voith Siemens has acquired Westinghouse and therefore is the sole repository of all technical design documentation and shop drawings on this unit.  That information has been determined to be proprietary and Voith Siemens will not release this information to the Bureau of Reclamation for use in a competitive procurement.  The as-built drawings that were provided to Reclamation as a final submittal under the contract do not provide sufficient dimensional detail or material property information necessary in order for the Government to competitively acquire these inspection services for a detailed failure analysis and recommendations for repair.

<SUBJECT>Applying Computerized Adaptive Testing to the Social Security Adm Disability Evaluation Process
<SOLNBR>NIHCL2009026
<RESPDATE>021909
<CONTACT>Ann G Argaman, Contracting Officer, Phone (301) 594-5919, Fax (301) 594-5920, Email ann.argaman@nih.gov
<DESC>The Rehabilitation Medicine Department in the Clinical Research Center at the National Institutes of Health (NIH-RMD) in Bethesda, Maryland  has agreed to assist the Social Security Administration (SSA) to explore innovative methods for augmenting the disability evaluation process.  This requires assessment of individuals’ functional abilities across a variety of domains (such as movement and physical activities, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and applied cognition) in relationship to functional demands in the workplace and features of the workplace, home, and community environments.  Rapid assessment methods are needed that are compatible with SSA processes and will yield easily interpretable results that can be efficiently and meaningfully integrated to provide accurate and uniform information about an individual’s ability to engage in substantial gainful employment.

To meet this objective, NIH-RMD seeks a contractor who will evaluate the feasibility of integrating into the SSA data collection and disability evaluation process,  a promising new testing method that has the potential to precisely measure outcomes across the full continuum of human functioning using Computer Adaptive Testing (CAT) coupled with Item Response Theory (IRT).  CAT represents a simple form of artificial intelligence software requiring computer technology for administration.  The demonstrated advantages of the CAT instruments compared to more traditional testing methods are: reduced respondent burden, increased score precision, elimination of ceiling and floor effects, client-specific confidence intervals, monitoring of data quality in real time, and lower data collection costs.  Because functional outcomes have been shown to have a clear hierarchical structure, gains in precision and efficiency of score estimation are superior to traditional fixed forms of functional assessment, thus transforming the ways in which outcomes can be monitored.

NIH-RMD has proposed application of CAT methods to the determination of key domains useful to the SSA disability determination and claims decision-making processes.  There is substantial additional work to be done before the full potential of IRT-CAT can be realized in this environment. These efforts will include a thorough evaluation of the feasibility of implementing CAT tools in the SSA environment, further development of existing CAT instruments, and development of new CAT instruments to assess critical aspects important the disability evaluation process such as job related functional requirements and the workplace environment.  In addition, cut-points will need to be established along each disability domain scale, as measured by CAT, to facilitate interpretation of levels of disability.  Evidence of prior CAT tool development and the adaption of CAT instrumentation will be needed to support the assessment of CAT tool application to critical aspects of the disability evaluation process, including job related functional requirements and the workplace environment. A contractor with substantial expertise in developing innovative ways to apply computerized adaptive testing methods and item response theory to evaluate the functional abilities of adults in relationship to performance requirements for substantial gainful employment is needed to assist in this work. If CAT methods are determined to be feasible during the base period of performance, then further development and evaluation of CAT assessment tools will occur in option years 1-2.  CAT tools should be compatible with the stepwise nature of the SSA disability evaluation process.  CAT tools should yield easily interpretable results that can be efficiently and meaningfully integrated to provide accurate, uniform, and rapid information about an individual’s potential to engage in substantial gainful employment. CAT development will take place at the contractor’s location, but the contractor will need to work closely with NIH-RMD and SSA staff via teleconferencing, electronic correspondence, and occasional face-to-face meetings at NIH and/or SSA to ensure that project objectives are met.  NIH-RMD hopes to build on existing electronic CAT tools that have been developed to date and are relevant to this project that quantify key domains including movement and physical activities, basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and applied cognition.
 
 This contract will have a base period of performance of twelve months, with two unilateral twelve-month option periods available for exercise by the Government.  A fixed price type contract is contemplated.  This electronicsolicitation is being issued with an issue date of January 21, 2009, with proposals due by February 19, 2009. No paper copies will be available. Offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of this solicitation and for routinely checking this site for any possible amendments that may be issued by the Government.

This acquisition has been designated as full and open competition under the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 541512, Size Standard - $21.0 million dollars. This advertisement does not commit the Government to award a contract.   For any questions, please contact Mrs. Ann Argaman at (301) 594-5919.

The Government intends to proceed under the authority of 10 USC 2304(c)(1) as implemented by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 6.302-1.  Bell Helicopter Textron is considered the only supplier, as they have designed and developed the systems that would be modified or repaired under this BOA.  However, the Government will consider all responsible sources and they may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation, which shall be considered by the agency if received within 15 days after the publication of this synopsis.

A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Bell owns the technical drawings, specifications and data rights for this product group, the Government does not.  

This is a presolicitation notice and is prepared in accordance with FAR 5.207.  The final dollar value of this action will be determined by the actual delivery orders issued.  The anticipated value is not expected to exceed  $24,000,000.  This announcement constitutes the only advertised solicitation; subcontracting opportunities would be available from Bell Helicopter Textron, 600 E Hurst Blvd, Hurst, TX 76101.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for closing agent services for single family properties owned by HUD in one geographic area, the state of Colorado. HUD intends to award one contract to cover the entire state of Colorado.   The primary objective is to perform closings on HUD-owned properties as quickly as possible, within 50 miles of the subject property. A purchaser is normally allowed 30-60 calendar days to close a transaction, however, sometimes HUD may offer special incentive programs to homebuyers to close in a shorter period of time, such as 15 days after contract signing. The contractor is expected to coordinate with the Management and Marketing contractor (M&M) to accomplish the closings within the allotted timeframes unless an extension is necessary due to circumstances outside of the contractor’s control. The contract will be performance-based with incentives and disincentives. The contract duration will be for one year with four one-year options. This is a total small business set-aside. More detailed information concerning the work requirements will be provided in the solicitation.  One contract will be awarded from this solicitation and the awardee will receive 50% of the closings in the State of Colorado.  The other 50% will be performed by an existing HUD contractor.  The solicitation should be available for downloading from the Federal Business Opportunity website on or after 2/9/2009. The NAICS Code is 541191 with a size standard of $7 million. No hard copies of the solicitation will be made available. Telephone and email requests for the solicitation will not be accepted. Small business concerns need to respond with a written proposal by the due date stated in the solicitation.

<DESC>SUBJECT: R - Regional Oversight Contract (ROC) for Federal facilities, FUDS, or FUSRAP sites in EPA Region III, which includes the states of Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
DESC: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires Federal Facility oversight services to support the Agency in its mission of oversight and enforcement both Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) activities at sites located at active, closing, closed, or former Federal facilities, including a Formerly Used Defense Site (FUDS) or Formerly Used Site Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP) site, and, to a lesser extent, non-Federal facilities within the geographic boundaries of EPA Region III.
The Federal Facilities Compliance Act of 1992 waives sovereign immunity for Federal hazardous waste generators, CERCLA 120 and the extensive oversight responsibilities to EPA for hazardous waste remediation projects at Federal facilities.  To fulfill these responsibilities, EPA reviews technical documents generated by the facility (or its contractor), approves remedies, oversees removals, assists in deliberations leading to agreements with other Federal agencies or non-Federal potentially responsible parties (PRPs), and determines appropriate penalties where necessary.  
The successful offeror will be required to demonstrate competency in the following areas: technical document review; meeting support; field activities and data review; and technical support for such activities as CERCLA Site assessments, Remedial Investigations/Feasibility Studies, Removals, Remedial Designs, post-Record of Decision (ROD) actions, community involvement and outreach, data management services, military munitions response services, radiation, and negotiations.
For the purposes of this procurement, the Agency will determine if  an offeror has a  pre-award potential conflict of interest (COI) if it currently holds a prime contract or subcontract with any party (other than EPA) for work related toCERCLA or RCRA activities, remedial planning or implementation, or reuse planning or development at sites located at an active, closing, closed, or former Federal facility within EPA Region III.  Any such potential conflict will be evaluated by EPA prior to award.
This procurement is a small business set-aside using NAICs code 562910, Environmental Remediation Services (Firms with 500 employees or less) and will result in the competitive award of one (1) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) - type contract with a minimum guarantee of $50,000 and a maximum of $1.5 million.  The contract will be Fixed Hourly Rates with indirect rate ceilings and charges for direct labor, travel, and other direct costs (ODCs).  The period of performance will consist of a one year base period and four option years.  The work will be handled via task orders. 
The resulting contract will be awarded based on technically acceptable / lowest price.
The selected firm will be required to submit a cost proposal, contract management plan, internal COI procedures, COI screen of Region III Federal Facility sites, quality assurance plan, procedures for handling confidential business information, health and safety plan, and plan for delivering analytical services.  In order to be awarded a contract, these must be deemed acceptable by EPA and agreement must be reached on a reasonable price.  Prior to award, contractor will also be required to have an acceptable accounting system that allows for segregation of costs.
The solicitation is scheduled for release on or about February 11, 2009.  The POC for this solicitation is James M. Clark, (P) 215-814-5198.  Requests for additional information should be emailed to clark.jim@epa.gov

<p>COMMUNITY CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT OFFICE (CCDO) STATEMENT OF WORK FOR TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE: <br />Indigenous Planning Implementation and Indian Country Economic Development</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION<br />The mission of the Community Capacity Development Office (CCDO) is to promote comprehensive strategies to reduce crime and revitalize communities. CCDO helps communities help themselves, enabling them to reduce violent and drug crime, strengthen community capacity to increase the quality of life, and promote long-term community health and resilience. CCDO aims to dramatically expand the level of public and private partnership models that build and sustain local capacity to create safe, thriving communities. The flagship of CCDO is the Weed and Seed strategy which aims to prevent, control, and reduce violent crime, criminal drug-related activity, and gang activity. <br />The Weed and Seed strategy is a community-based, comprehensive multi-agency approach. Four elements make up the two-pronged Weed and Seed Strategy: Law Enforcement; Community Policing; Prevention, Intervention, and Treatment; and Neighborhood Restoration. Limited discretionary grant resources are available annually for technical assistance and training to selected Weed and Seed Communities (WSC's) subject to Congressional funding. WSCs must work to reduce crime and improve the quality of life for residents in a community primarily through the redeployment of existing public and private resources, addressing both crime and social related problems that without proper intervention often lead to violent crime, drug abuse, and gang activity.</p>
<p>CCDO has made available or provided various technical assistance and training activities to Weed and Seed sites. Request for technical assistance and training is often site driven; but can also be a recommendation from the CCDO program manager. CCDO existing technical assistance and training program serves to:</p>
<p>&bull; Plan and develop programs to prevent and respond to criminal justice issues through building community capacity training and technical assistance (including on-site) on various topics for Weed and Seed sites and eligible communities<br />&bull; Develop the skills of site coordinators; steering committee members and community residents<br />&bull; Identify and disseminate information about techniques and methods proven effective in building community capacity and revitalize neighborhoods<br />&bull; Support jurisdictional teams that assist State, local and tribal agencies working directly with high violent crime and economically distress communities</p>
<p><br />BACKGROUND</p>
<p>Training and technical assistance (TA) activities must be tied to purpose areas of the CCDO Weed and Seed Communities (WSC) grant program and community capacity building. To learn more about the WSC grant program, go to www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ccdo and click on Weed and Seed. <br />Training and technical assistance priorities for CCDO are established to increase responsiveness to consumer needs, promote the use of best practices and programs, and manage performance standards for effective practice in the assessment, planning, delivery, and evaluation of program activities. CCDO has focused recent training and technical assistance on capacity building of community partners and residents to assist in sustaining program activities.</p>
<p>Through the Weed and Seed Communities program, funds and technical assistance are provided to communities for programs focused on crime reduction and community revitalization.

<SUBJECT>Security Screening Algorithm Market Research
<SOLNBR>OPO-09-00000-RFI

<CONTACT>Alula Abera, Contract Specialist, Phone 2022546896, Email alula.abera@associates.hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) is seeking information on a wide variety of both advanced software algorithms and developmental algorithm concepts that are applicable to security screening, in order to improve threat detection, decrease false alarms, and increase overall throughput.  DHS S&T is gathering feasibility data through this Request for Information (RFI) with a view to potentially license algorithms for use in security screening.

Security screening systems are deployed at the 500+ airports in the United States.  These systems have been tested by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for use in screening personnel, luggage, and cargo for threats such as explosives, weapons, and other contraband.

DHS S&T's Explosives Division (EXD) desires to enable 3rd party participation in algorithm development to improve the performance of security screening systems for aviation venues.  In this context, “3rd party” refers to a commercial industry vendor that licenses their algorithms for use with another vendor’s detection system.  This research project is being coordinated with the TSA's Chief Technology Office (TSA/CTO) and in conjunction with other EXD Research and Development activities.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>The General Services Administration (GSA), Region 7, is seeking a contractor to perform as the CMc (Construction Manager as Contractor) for the construction of the New United States Land Port of Entry (LPOE) in Tornillo, Texas. The site is located in El Paso County, Texas. It is situated approximately 30 miles east of El Paso and is adjacent to the current Fabens Port of Entry facility, which will be demolished as part of the construction option in this contract.
<p>An estimated 115 acres will compose the new LPOE. Both the land donation and the delivery of utilities to the perimeter of the site will be completed by El Paso County. The new LPOE will be a full-service port and will include non-commercial facilities (import and export) including Personal Occupancy Vehicles (POV) canopies, an Administration Building, a Secondary Head House; commercial facilities (import and export) including truck canopies, docks, and Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) systems; a canine kennel; a central plant; and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission (TABC) and Federal Motor Carriers Safety Administration (FMCSA) facilities. The total building area (including canopies) is 86,596 GSF. Site work includes roadways, drainage retention ponds, and 160 exterior parking spaces. The construction of this project will take place on land located near the existing port of entry, operations which will be a continuous 24 hours, 7 days a week effort. <br /><br />The success of this construction project is directly related to the completion of the new Tornillo-Guadalupe International Bridge. The new proposed site is located within the El Paso-Juarez Valley. The El Paso-Juarez Valley broadens into a valley of four to five miles in width below El Paso, Texas. The proposed site falls within the boundary of the Chihuahuan Desert where basin and range topography characterize the region. There is little drainage that flows through the region; consequently, the Rio Grande is one of the few areas of erosional lowland. The proposed LPOE site is located adjacent to the Rio Grande River and the topography consists of a level to gently sloping surface.</p>
<p>In coordinating all agencies located at the existing Fabens LPOE at the new Tornillo-Guadalupe LPOE, travelers and commercial drivers' safety and efficiency will be increased greatly. This LPOE will also alleviate congestion and overextended resources at neighboring Ports. In addition, new facilities will improve working conditions for employees and tenants at the current location. Increased traffic flow through this area with the establishment of new LPOE facilities will encourage economic growth for the neighboring communities of Fabens and Tornillo on the United States side and Casetas on the Mexico side. Revenue can be generated by providing the Texas Alcoholic Beverages Commission facilities to enforce and collect duties on imported alcoholic and tobacco goods. The new Tornillo-Guadalupe International Bridge will be a toll bridge and the revenue collection point for El Paso County will be located just to the north of the LPOE on the south bound lanes.</p>
<p>Richter Architects is the Design Architect/Engineer. Coast and Harbor Associates is the Construction Manager as Advisor (CMa). Design began in June 2008, and the 20% design submittal is due to GSA in February 2009. The construction start is presently scheduled for March 2010, however there could be an earlier start. The project duration is 825 calendar days. Construction funding is estimated between $50 - $75million. GSA intends to award a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) contract for construction services consisting of Design Stage services and an Option for the actual Construction Stage. GSA intends to issue a Best Value Request for Proposals (RFP). There are two components of work to be performed by the CMc under this contract: Design Stage services and Option for Construction Stage work. Evaluation factors and sub-factors being considered are Past Performance in Providing Design Stage Services and Construction Stage Work on Similar Projects, Qualifications and Experience of Key Personnel, CMc's Use of Current Electronic Project Management Technology, and CMc Project Management Plan.</p>
<p>The overall responsibilities of the CMc are to perform construction management services relating to constructability, construction strategy and logistics, and budget control under the Design Stage services component, and (upon exercise of the Construction Stage work option) to perform the construction in accordance with the construction documents and other requirements under the Construction Stage work component.</p>
<p>The GSA Art in Architecture program involves the selection of an artist to create and install artwork within the project. The artwork will be procured, furnished and installed under separate contracts. The cost of separate contracts for the artwork is not included in the construction budget. New GSA-owned facilities are required to meet, at a minimum, the energy standard prescribed in the ASHRAE Standard. This project must be certified through the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED&reg;) green building rating system. The target USGBC LEED&reg; rating for this project is Silver level. The project must achieve at a minimum the LEED&reg; certified rating, with higher rating levels encouraged. The CMc is responsible for executing the construction, including provision of specified products, systems and materials, as necessary to achieve anticipated sustainability goals (LEED&reg; credits).</p>
<p>A Pre-Proposal Conference will be held at the existing LPOE on February 9, 2009 in El Paso, TX. The time and location on the LPOE for this conference will be forthcoming in the RFP.</p>
<p>The Government's final selection will be to the responsible Offeror whose proposal is the Best Value to the Government considering that all technical factors when combined are significantly more important than cost or price.</p>
<p>The Offeror must provide a statement from their bonding corporate surety that appears on the list contained in the Department of Treasury Circular 570 "companies holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties on federal bonds and acceptable reinsuring companies", as certifying their bonding capacity for a project with an estimated range for construction cost of $50,000,000-$75,000,000. Other bonding options are available in accordance with FAR 28.204 and may be provided as an alternative to evidence of corporate bonding capacity.</p>
<p>This Is A Full and Open Procurement. This procurement is open to all business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small and minority-owned firms are strongly encouraged to participate. An acceptable Subcontracting Plan shall be agreed upon prior to contract award to any large business. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to achieve the following minimum goals for all subcontracted work: 37% for Small Business (SB), which includes 3.0% for HUBZone Small Business (HZSB), 6% for Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB), 5% for Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), 5% for Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB) that includes 3% for Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).</p>
<p>All proposal development costs shall be borne by the Offeror without reimbursement by the Government.</p>
<p>All responsible firms are invited to submit a proposal, which shall be considered by the agency. Firms interested in the RFP should submit a letter of interest by e-mail to kathey.thury@gsa.gov, Attn: Kathey Thury, Contracting Officer, 7PMA. The request shall include the signed Document Security Form with a copy of the firm's business license with company's name, DUNS number, Tax ID#, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address. The RFP is expected to be issued on or about February 4, 2009 to all accepted firms who have submitted the information. Closing date and time for submittal of proposals will be on or about March 4, 2009 at 3:30pm, CST. Questions will be received until February 18, 2009. This is not a request for proposal (RFP).

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY (IAW FAR 52.215-3). This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes; it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP or Broad Area Announcement (BAA). This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Secure Border Initiative (SBI) is not at this time seeking proposals. The issuance of this RFI does not obligate DHS in any way to issue an RFP for goods and services described in this RFI. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay any cost incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party’s expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP or BAA. If a solicitation is released, it will be via the Federal Business Opportunities (http://www.fedbizopps.gov).  It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these websites for any information that may pertain to this RFI. The information provided in this RFI is subject to change and is not binding on the Government. All submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and will not be returned.

1.0 BACKGROUND
The Secure Border Initiative (SBI) is a comprehensive multi-year plan established by DHS to secure America’s borders and reduce illegal migration.  CBP supports the SBI through law enforcement programs within several program offices – SBI Systems Project Office (SBI SPO), Office of Border Patrol (OBP), Office of Field Operations (OFO), the Office of CBP Air & Marine (A&M) and Office of Intelligence and Operations Coordination (OIOC). In addition, SBI is charged with integrating and responding to requirements of operational mission elements outside of CBP—including but not limited to the USCG, ICE, and the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis.

Continually striving to optimize the alignment of its resources the SBI SPO is establishing a unique organizational element that is conceptually new to CBP and DHS, the Directorate for Operational Integration. The Directorate for Operational Integration will ensure that SBI programs are responsive to the needs and requirements of the CBP operational mission components, OBP, OFO, A&M, and Office of Intelligence and Operations Coordination and the operational mission elements outside of CBP—including the USCG, ICE, and the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis that share responsibility for the security of the Nation’s borders.  

The Directorate for Operational Integration does not determine operational requirements; however it does have responsibility to facilitate the synthesis and integration of those requirements on behalf of the operational mission elements.  Facilitation and documentation of activities like mission analyses, Analysis of Alternatives (AoAs), operational assessments, and quantification of operational requirements are conducted as a part of operational integration activities. Two examples of the type of trade studies that might be addressed through this modeling capability involve; 1) At a Port of Entry trading-off pedestrian and vehicle wait times (facilitation) versus security (opportunity to gather advance information); 2) Between the Ports of Entry analyzing the use of Tactical Infrastructure (fence) versus more surveillance equipment and/or agents.

In addition to addressing materiel solutions to improving Border Security the Operational Integration Directorate will support the operational components in their development of comprehensive approaches that optimize border security effectiveness through a combination of materiel and non-materiel solutions. Non-materiel solutions to border security will include changes to Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel and Facilities (DOTMLPF), Concepts of Operations (CONOPs) and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs). 

It is critical that the new Directorate for Operational Integration have the modeling and simulation capability necessary to address and make trade-offs among the full range of material and non-material options that are available to the operational components that are responsible for securing our borders.

Prior to beginning a substantial effort to develop a high-fidelity, comprehensive modeling and simulation capability; CBP is interested in identifying opportunities to demonstrate and practice with quick, low cost, rudimentary models.  This early activity would be intended to:
   - Enable the operational mission elements to conduct low-fidelity “war-gaming” and high order mission area analyses
   - Provide rough quantification of DOTMLPF trade-offs in support of CBP investment decisions
   - Enable CBP to understand the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities offered by mission modeling and simulation
   - Support development of lessons learned (based on experience with the low cost, rudimentary model(s)) to advise development of acquisition strategy for follow-on modeling and simulation tools

The program is interested in determining which vendors have visualization capabilities to display the results of the models and analyses described above.  This capability does not have to be bundled with the modeling capacity, but it should be able to provide user friendly visualization of the results of the models and trade-off analyses.

In short, the initial effort would enable CBP to gain experience and practice from a low-cost capability for modeling and simulation.

2.0 OBJECTIVE 
DHS CBP is soliciting information on capabilities to provide the quick, low cost, rudimentary model described above.  Such capabilities would include, but are not necessarily limited to, high level models that exist or could be modified to support border security mission analyses, AoAs, operational assessments, and quantification of operational requirements including trade-offs among materiel solutions and non-materiel solutions (DOTMLPF). The modeling capability must be provide a “war gaming” capability to allow users to visualize the impacts of allocating different mixes of resources (materiel solutions) versus different methods of applying these resources (non-materiel solutions).  

Initially, the modeling capability should be rudimentary and should be available for CBP use within 6 months from initiation of effort.  It would be useful, but not required, for the rudimentary capability to be extensible in the future.  Extensibility encompasses both breadth (moving from internal CBP components to components outside of CBP) and depth (increased capability, fidelity, and accuracy).

Vendors interested in submitting information may be asked to provide a demonstration of their existing model(s) (if there are existing models) at a venue to be determined. DHS will not pay for any costs related to a vendor’s preparation, delivery, or participation in the demonstration.

3.0 RFI SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS
The submissions must consist of a 3- to 5-page response detailing the modeling capability that would meet the needs described above. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330. The response shall describe the modeling approach, and its maturity, and its development pedigree. A major obstacle to previous border security modeling efforts has been the availability of data required for modeling. The submission must include discussion of the data that will be required by the vendor’s model, how the vendor proposes to obtain the needed data, or how the vendor proposes to provide for the interests described above in the absence of good data. Vendors should be aware that Law Enforcement Sensitive data requires special protection and will not be releasable to non-US Citizens.

CBP is interested in a broad set of options and responses—so this RFI is not limited to those potential respondents who already have a demonstration model.  However, CBP would especially value responses from vendors willing to provide a demonstration unit for evaluation purposes at a location yet to be determined. 

Include the following on the cover page of your response:
1) State the name, size classification (Small/8A/etc), and principal place of business of the vendor.

2) State the name, address, email address, telephone number of the vendor representative to contact regarding all matters concerning this RFI.

3) CAGE Code and DUNS Number. Business type by the associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).

4) Confirm whether or not it is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.

Responses must be in Microsoft Word 2003 or earlier format, or Portable Document Format (PDF) compatible with Adobe Acrobat 7.0 or Reader 8.

Please submit responses electronically to mario.dizon@dhs.gov.  All submissions are due electronically no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on 16 February 2009. The response must be sent with RFI HSBP0109RHLM clearly displayed on the subject line. DHS reserves the right to review late submissions but makes no guarantee to the order of or possibility for review of late submissions.

Responders will be permitted to ask a single round of questions on this RFI.  Questions must be submitted no later than 5:00 PM EST on 2 February 2008 to mario.dizon@dhs.gov and merv.leavitt@dhs.gov.  

4.0 PROTECTION OF RESPONSES
RFI responses will not be returned. Depending on the markings on the responses, the DHS will adhere to FAR policy on handling source selection information and proprietary information. It is the policy of the DHS to treat all RFI information as sensitive competitive information. 

Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED PROPRIETARY. To aid DHS, please segregate proprietary information. DHS, other Federal agencies, or their support contractors cannot sign submitter nondisclosure agreements.

Note:  Be advised that all submissions become the property of the Federal Government, and cannot be returned. Responses to this RFI may be evaluated by Government technical experts drawn from staff within DHS and other Federal agencies. The Government may use selected support contractor personnel to assist in the evaluation. These support contractors will be bound by appropriate non-disclosure agreements to protect proprietary and source-selection information.

<RESPDATE>020609
<ARCHDATE>12312009
<CONTACT>Tonya R Rymer, Contract Specialist, Phone 907-228-6244, Fax 907-228-6254, Email trymer@fs.fed.us - John Inman, Contract Specialist, Phone 907-228-6231, Fax 907-228-6254, Email jinman@fs.fed.us
<DESC>The Tongass National Forest has recently completed an evaluation of audiovisual needs at two world-class visitor centers, the Southeast Alaska Discovery Center (SEADC) in Ketchikan, Alaska, and the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center (MGVC) in Juneau, Alaska. These evaluations included assessments of visitor profiles, trends of ecotourism and expectations of visitors at the visitor centers, and the history and conditions of the current audiovisual offerings in each of indoor theatre facilities at each center. We have consistently viewed these visitor centers as the public face of the Tongass National Forest, which are visited by well over 750,000 people each year. 

The Tongass National Forest needs to install high-quality up-to-date sound, lighting, projection screen, and digital computer-driven visual projection systems to facilitate the showing of a True High Definition film 12 to 18 minutes in length for continuous showing during the summer season.  We also need other equipment and attendant wiring to facilitate the use of remote accessed, computer driven projection from a laptop during the winter season lecture series, and the ability to play other DVDs and movies from the projection booths.

Specific key messages, themes, and sub-themes for each movie will emphasize the unique qualities of public land in the Tongass National Forest, the mission and vision of the Forest Service as an agency, and the links between the resources and values of the public lands and the American people, residents and visitors, and the global community. 

Audiovisual hardware needs include: 

(1) Removal of existing unusable hardware and rewiring; installation, testing and training for a new high quality projector,  projection control and playback through an encoded hard drive on a dedicated computer;

(2) Backup device with flash drives for storage; 

(3) Power conditioner; installation of attendant surround sound; and 

(4) Remote connection for wide screen projection of external lap top driven programs separate from the movies such as power point programs and DVDs. 

The movie production needs include a True High Definition production that will include aerial and seasonal footage shot in southeast Alaska, color correction, captioning solutions, narration, and original music/background sound. Other needs include three master tapes of each of the productions for archival purposes and the potential for authoring a DVD of the movies for sale through the Alaska Geographic interpretive Association. 

The Tongass National Forest presently envisions two requests for proposals, one for the hardware solutions in the visitors’ centers, and the other for the production of two separate films. Our need includes a timeline that requires installations of hardware to take place in or soon after October 2009 and production of the movies to be completed in late spring of 2010 for viewing to begin in May 2010. 

Instructions to Interested Parties:  Potential providers of audiovisual hardware for the two visitor centers and/or the production of movies for each site with options noted above are invited to identify themselves by submitting information and/or responses no more than four pages in length to the following items to help us understand such matters as (a) what capabilities exist in the marketplace to meet our needs; (b) whether the sequence of the RFPs (with hardware before production) is of critical importance; (c) how much detail is recommended for storyboards and written narration for the productions success; (d) whether our deadlines for outcomes are reasonable and doable; (e) thoughts on how the Forest Service might evaluate proposals to identify the best hardware and movie production solutions; (f) ideas and thoughts regarding the costs the Forest Service might be expected to pay; and (g) other information that might be helpful to the Forest Service as we determine our requirements and our approach to the acquisition. The information shared in your responses will be used by the Forest Service to determine how we might proceed with an acquisition strategy. 

This is not a solicitation for process and products to be purchased in the immediate future; rather, this is market research to help us determine how we might proceed with acquiring audiovisual hardware and movies for our visitor centers.  Responses should be delivered by the close of business on February 6, 2009, with one copy each to Faith L. Duncan, Tongass National Forest, Ketchikan Supervisor’s Office, 648 Mission Street, Ketchikan, AK 99901, and John Inman, Tongass National Forest, Ketchikan Supervisor’s Office, 648 Mission Street, Ketchikan, AK 99901.  Alternatively, the information may be emailed to fduncan@fs.fed.us and jinman@fs.fed.us.

<DESC>As prescribed in FAR 15.209(c), the following provision is inserted: IAW FAR 52.215-3.  Request for Information (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information (RFI), or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  (b) Although "proposal" and "offeror" may be used in this RFI, your response will be as information only.  It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This RFI is issued for the purpose of identifying information on a new design of an Engine Performance Indicator, (EPI) for the T/AV-8B aircraft.  PMA-257 is issuing a RFI in an effort to determine potential sources and information on existing Engine Performance Indicator (EPI) cockpit displays.  This announcement is for market research and does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP).  This is not a Research and Development (R&D) request.  PMA-257 is seeking information on affordable EPI(s) using the latest Commercial Off  The Shelf (COTS) technology.  Respondents are invited to supply sample hardware that the government may or may not choose to conduct some limited ground and flight testing with.  These assets would be returned after the completion of testing.  There is no commitment by the Government to test any furnished hardware offered by respondents.  Any hardware that is not used for testing will be returned to the vendor within 6 months.  The vendor will have no rights to any test data or reports generated by the government on their product line.  Any follow on procurement strategy is dependent on product demonstration results and available funding.  Essentially, it is expected that in the follow-on procurement strategy, the Government will be looking for a system that would offer the "best overall value" to the Government (mission function, ease of integration and operational use, Total Cost of Ownership, etc…), not necessarily the lowest procurement cost.  However, affordability would be a crucial factor.  The following agency needs are provided to assist in conducting this RFI.  
Engine Performance Indicator   

The following is provided to potential vendors to provide insight into the governments thoughts at this date on Thresholds Requirements (must have) and objective requirements (beneficial to have).  These pre – decisional thoughts on requirements are subject to change in a future RFP. 
  
1.	Threshold:  

a.	All engineering drawings, interface requirements and definitions, test reports, and other pertinent data will be made available to the government.  
b.	Installation concept shall not require modification to existing aircraft hardware and software architecture.  
c.	No changes shall be required in the existing aircraft interface (same pin-outs without wiring for internal test points and same external dimensions)
d.	The unit shall interface with existing 28V DC aircraft power.
e.	The new EPI shall display 9 different readings in digital form preferably as a green digital display.  
f.	The new EPI shall be compatible with a transducer(s) to receive and interpret analog inputs from the engine. 
g.	The unit shall be readable in all day / night lighting conditions.
h.	The unit shall be night vision goggle (NVG) compatible and must meet NVG lighting standards(s) as per MIL-L-85762A Lighting, Aircraft, Interior, Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) Compatible 
i.	The readout shall warn of out- of- range data.
j.	The unit shall provide real time functional display.  
k.	Data shall be readable for all pilot height / seat height / eye orientations.
l.	The indicator shall have a manual brightness control with selectable day / night mode.
m.	A Built In Test (BIT) function (startup, periodic, initiated and maintenance initiated self-contained diagnostics with failure indications to facilitate quick troubleshooting and fault isolation) shall be implemented.    
n.	The unit shall indicate to the aircrew a built in fault handling display in a clear readily interpreted format display of any internal failure resulting in erroneous data being displayed; i.e., latent or stale data. 
o.	No flex assemblies or jumpers shall be required.   




2.	Objectives:

a.	The unit should enable ground functional checks no or minimal additional support equipment or logistics footprint.
b.	Circuit cards should be "plug and play" and easily removed and replaced by higher levels of maintenance. 
c.	The EPI should be wired for internal test points.

Interested parties qualified of providing an all digital Engine Performance Indicator, which meet or exceed the above requirements, shall provide a Statement of Capability (SOC). This describes the vendor's existing proficiency to supply, modify, and sustain the system to aircraft out of service date.  

The SOC shall be unclassified and the information submitted should be pertinent to, and identify system capability as related to the technical effort requested above.  A limit of twenty (20) pages is imposed for the responses.  Responses should be received by close of business 30 days after release of RFI.  
Please direct all questions to Ms. Pat Morris at fitzpatrick.morris@navy.mil.  Again, this RFI is not to be construed as a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to directly pay for any information or any responses submitted as the result of this RFI.

<DESC>The Department of Transportation, Maritime Administration, intends to award a contract on a sole source basis to Technical Marine Services to replace and upgrade controls for evaporator jacket water-by-pass loop, engine jacket water temperature regulation and exhaust gas boiler make-up feed.  Because Technical Marine Services was selected following full and open competition procedures to perform Phases I and II of a three part automation system upgrade, it is believed that they are the only firm with the capability to perform the third part of this upgrade.  The proposed upgrade must be operationally compatible with and integral with the recently upgraded engine automation system which features a G.E. Fanuc, Series 9030, programmable logic controller (PLC) based system performed by Technical Marine Services.  The design and installation must be in accordance with all applicable regulations of the USCG and ABS. Proposed upgrade must be of proven reliability and supportability and must retain all existing functionality of the existing controls. This notice is not a request for proposals/quotes. However, interested parties may identify their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirements by emailing a Capability Statement (CS) or faxing the CS at 757-441-6080 by 2:30 p.m. on 26 Jan 2009. Capability statements must include documentation establishing the ability to satisfy the Government's requirements. Any information received will be considered for the purpose of conducting a competitive procurement. Interested persons should identify their interest and capability to the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Telephone inquires should be made to Laurel Bishop, Contracting Officer, (757) 441-3120.

<p><br />________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p><br />ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:</p>
<p>HEALTH &amp; WELFARE: $3.24 per hour or $129.60 per week or $561.60 per month</p>
<p>VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or<br />successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years. Length of service<br />includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or<br />successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the<br />performance of similar work at the same Federal facility. (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)</p>
<p>HOLIDAYS: A minimum of ten paid holidays per year: New Year's Day, Martin Luther<br />King Jr.'s Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,<br />Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. (A<br />contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another day off with pay in<br />accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.) (See 29 CFR 4.174)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as<br />numbered):</p>
<p>1) Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any<br />employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or<br />professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541. Because most Computer<br />System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than<br />$27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour<br />would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage<br />rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those<br />job families. In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate<br />for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates<br />that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour<br />conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees. For example, if an<br />individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope<br />of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which<br />this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for<br />that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures<br />described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.</p>
<p>Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer<br />industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer<br />professional exemption. Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees<br />who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:<br />(1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including<br />consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional<br />specifications;<br />(2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or<br />modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and<br />related to user or system design specifications;<br />(3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer<br />programs related to machine operating systems; or<br />(4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which<br />requires the same level of skills. (29 C.F.R. 541.400).</p>
<p>2) AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY &amp; SUNDAY PAY: If you<br />work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential<br />and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.<br />If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your<br />regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday<br />premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime<br />(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered<br />overtime work).</p>
<p><br />HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees<br />employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or<br />in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials. This<br />includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive<br />ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder<br />and photoflash powder. All dry-house activities involving propellants or<br />explosives. Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance<br />operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials. All<br />operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.</p>
<p>A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that<br />represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to<br />ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials<br />which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the<br />employee engaged in the operation, irritation of the skin, minor burns and the<br />like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.<br />All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and<br />incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition. These differentials<br />are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for<br />ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.</p>
<p>** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or<br />local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an<br />employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage<br />determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the<br />following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual<br />cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made<br />the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to<br />this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining<br />agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary<br />affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning<br />and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day). However, in<br />those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"<br />materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do<br />not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial<br />laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms<br />of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,<br />there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.</p>
<p>The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the<br />"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,<br />unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A<br />links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at<br />http://www.dol.gov/esa/whd/ or through the Wage Determinations On-Line (WDOL) Web<br />site at http://wdol.gov/.</p>
<p>REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form<br />1444 (SF 1444)}</p>
<p>Conformance Process:</p>
<p>The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is<br />not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to<br />be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage<br />determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable<br />relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted<br />classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination. Such<br />conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the<br />fringe benefits as are determined. Such conforming process shall be initiated by<br />the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)<br />of employees. The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall<br />be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}<br />When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444<br />should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be<br />conformed.</p>
<p>The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:</p>
<p>1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed<br />occupation) and computes a proposed rate).</p>
<p>2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order<br />proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each<br />proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage<br />rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the<br />authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized<br />representative, the employees themselves. This report should be submitted to the<br />contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees<br />performs any contract work.</p>
<p>3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report<br />of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent<br />information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage<br />and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,<br />for review. (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).</p>
<p>4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or<br />disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or<br />notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process<br />the request.</p>
<p>5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.</p>
<p>6) The contractor informs the affected employees.</p>
<p>Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.</p>
<p>When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of<br />Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure<br />that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the<br />wage determination. Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that<br />determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.<br />Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide<br />classifications listed in the wage determination.</p>

If the contract awardee wishes to make a separate public announcement, the awardee must obtain the approval of the Contracting Officer prior to releasing the announcement, and must plan to make announcement only after the contract has been awarded.

1752.209-74	Organizational Conflicts of Interest

	(d)	The Contractor must include this clause in all subcontracts and in lower tier subcontracts unless a waiver is requested from, and granted by, the Contracting Officer.

		(3)	Present for approval a conflict of interest mitigation plan that will:

	(4)	The Contractor must not commence work on a changed requirement related to a potential conflict of interest until specifically notified by the Contracting Officer to proceed.

________________________________________________________________________________


ALL OCCUPATIONS LISTED ABOVE RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS:

HEALTH & WELFARE: $3.24 per hour or $129.60 per week or $561.60 per month

VACATION: 2 weeks paid vacation after 1 year of service with a contractor or
successor; 3 weeks after 5 years, and 4 weeks after 15 years.  Length of service
includes the whole span of continuous service with the present contractor or
successor, wherever employed, and with the predecessor contractors in the
performance of similar work at the same Federal facility.  (Reg. 29 CFR 4.173)

HOLIDAYS: A minimum of eleven paid holidays per year:  New Year's Day, Martin
Luther King Jr's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Good Friday, Memorial Day,
Independence Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veterans' Day, Thanksgiving Day, and
Christmas Day.  A contractor may substitute for any of the named holidays another
day off with pay in accordance with a plan communicated to the employees involved.)
(See 29 CFR 4.174)



THE OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAVE PARENTHESES AFTER THEM RECEIVE THE FOLLOWING BENEFITS (as
numbered):

1)  Under the SCA at section 8(b), this wage determination does not apply to any
employee who individually qualifies as a bona fide executive, administrative, or
professional employee as defined in 29 C.F.R. Part 541.  Because most Computer
System Analysts and Computer Programmers who are compensated at a rate not less than
$27.63 (or on a salary or fee basis at a rate not less than $455 per week) an hour
would likely qualify as exempt computer professionals, (29 C.F.R. 541.400) wage
rates may not be listed on this wage determination for all occupations within those
job families.  In addition, because this wage determination may not list a wage rate
for some or all occupations within those job families if the survey data indicates
that the prevailing wage rate for the occupation equals or exceeds $27.63 per hour
conformances may be necessary for certain nonexempt employees.  For example, if an
individual employee is nonexempt but nevertheless performs duties within the scope
of one of the Computer Systems Analyst or Computer Programmer occupations for which
this wage determination does not specify an SCA wage rate, then the wage rate for
that employee must be conformed in accordance with the conformance procedures
described in the conformance note included on this wage determination.

Additionally, because job titles vary widely and change quickly in the computer
industry, job titles are not determinative of the application of the computer
professional exemption.  Therefore, the exemption applies only to computer employees
who satisfy the compensation requirements and whose primary duty consists of:
    (1) The application of systems analysis techniques and procedures, including
consulting with users, to determine hardware, software or system functional
specifications;
    (2) The design, development, documentation, analysis, creation, testing or
modification of computer systems or programs, including prototypes, based on and
related to user or system design specifications;
    (3) The design, documentation, testing, creation or modification of computer
programs related to machine operating systems; or
    (4) A combination of the aforementioned duties, the performance of which
requires the same level of skills.  (29 C.F.R. 541.400).

2)  AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS AND WEATHER OBSERVERS - NIGHT PAY & SUNDAY PAY:  If you
work at night as part of a regular tour of duty, you will earn a night differential
and receive an additional 10% of basic pay for any hours worked between 6pm and 6am.
 If you are a full-time employed (40 hours a week) and Sunday is part of your
regularly scheduled workweek, you are paid at your rate of basic pay plus a Sunday
premium of 25% of your basic rate for each hour of Sunday work which is not overtime
(i.e. occasional work on Sunday outside the normal tour of duty is considered
overtime work).


HAZARDOUS PAY DIFFERENTIAL: An 8 percent differential is applicable to employees
employed in a position that represents a high degree of hazard when working with or
in close proximity to ordinance, explosives, and incendiary materials.  This
includes work such as screening, blending, dying, mixing, and pressing of sensitive
ordance, explosives, and pyrotechnic compositions such as lead azide, black powder
and photoflash powder.  All dry-house activities involving propellants or
explosives.  Demilitarization, modification, renovation, demolition, and maintenance
operations on sensitive ordnance, explosives and incendiary materials.  All
operations involving regrading and cleaning of artillery ranges.

A 4 percent differential is applicable to employees employed in a position that
represents a low degree of hazard when working with, or in close proximity to
ordance, (or employees possibly adjacent to) explosives and incendiary materials
which involves potential injury such as laceration of hands, face, or arms of the
employee engaged in the operation,  irritation of the skin, minor burns and the
like; minimal damage to immediate or adjacent work area or equipment being used.
All operations involving, unloading, storage, and hauling of ordance, explosive, and
incendiary ordnance material other than small arms ammunition.  These differentials
are only applicable to work that has been specifically designated by the agency for
ordance, explosives, and incendiary material differential pay.

** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **

If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract
(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state or
local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by
laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by an
employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the wage
determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance with the
following standards as compliance:

The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an
adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the actual
cost of the uniforms.  In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance is made
the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors subject to
this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide collective bargaining
agreement providing for a different amount, or the furnishing of contrary
affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all employees for such cleaning
and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67 cents per day).  However, in
those instances where the uniforms furnished are made of "wash and wear"
materials, may be routinely washed and dried with other personal garments, and do
not require any special treatment such as dry cleaning, daily washing, or commercial
laundering in order to meet the cleanliness or appearance standards set by the terms
of the Government contract, by the contractor, by law, or by the nature of the work,
there is no requirement that employees be reimbursed for uniform maintenance costs.

The duties of employees under job titles listed are those described in the
"Service Contract Act Directory of Occupations", Fifth Edition, April 2006,
unless otherwise indicated. Copies of the Directory are available on the Internet. A
links to the Directory may be found on the WHD home page at

site at http://wdol.gov/.

REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION OF ADDITIONAL CLASSIFICATION AND WAGE RATE {Standard Form
1444 (SF 1444)}

Conformance Process:

The contracting officer shall require that any class of service employee which is
not listed herein and which is to be employed under the contract (i.e., the work to
be performed is not performed by any classification listed in the wage
determination), be classified by the contractor so as to provide a reasonable
relationship (i.e., appropriate level of skill comparison) between such unlisted
classifications and the classifications listed in the wage determination.  Such
conformed classes of employees shall be paid the monetary wages and furnished the
fringe benefits as are determined.  Such conforming process shall be initiated by
the contractor prior to the performance of contract work by such unlisted class(es)
of employees.  The conformed classification, wage rate, and/or fringe benefits shall
be retroactive to the commencement date of the contract. {See Section 4.6 (C)(vi)}
When multiple wage determinations are included in a contract, a separate SF 1444
should be prepared for each wage determination to which a class(es) is to be
conformed.

The process for preparing a conformance request is as follows:

1) When preparing the bid, the contractor identifies the need for a conformed
occupation) and computes a proposed rate).

2) After contract award, the contractor prepares a written report listing in order
proposed classification title), a Federal grade equivalency (FGE) for each
proposed classification), job description), and rationale for proposed wage
rate), including information regarding the agreement or disagreement of the
authorized representative of the employees involved, or where there is no authorized
representative, the employees themselves.  This report should be submitted to the
contracting officer no later than 30 days after such unlisted class(es) of employees
performs any contract work.

3) The contracting officer reviews the proposed action and promptly submits a report
of the action, together with the agency's recommendations and pertinent
information including the position of the contractor and the employees, to the Wage
and Hour Division, Employment Standards Administration, U.S. Department of Labor,
for review.  (See section 4.6(b)(2) of Regulations 29 CFR Part 4).

4) Within 30 days of receipt, the Wage and Hour Division approves, modifies, or
disapproves the action via transmittal to the agency contracting officer, or
notifies the contracting officer that additional time will be required to process
the request.

5) The contracting officer transmits the Wage and Hour decision to the contractor.

6) The contractor informs the affected employees.

Information required by the Regulations must be submitted on SF 1444 or bond paper.

When preparing a conformance request, the "Service Contract Act Directory of
Occupations" (the Directory) should be used to compare job definitions to insure
that duties requested are not performed by a classification already listed in the
wage determination.  Remember, it is not the job title, but the required tasks that
determine whether a class is included in an established wage determination.
Conformances may not be used to artificially split, combine, or subdivide
classifications listed in the wage determination.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 

(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

For statistical purposes only, the offeror shall indicate whether the place of manufacture of the end products it expects to provide in response to this solicitation is predominantly—

(2) o Outside the United States. 

(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] 
[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror o does o does not certify that— 
(i) The items of equipment to be serviced under this contract are used regularly for other than Governmental purposes and are sold or traded by the offeror in substantial quantities to the general public in the course of normal business operations;

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).  
(1) All offerors must submit the information required in paragraphs (l)(3) through (l)(5) of this provision to comply with debt collection requirements of 31 U.S.C. 7701(c) and 3325(d), reporting requirements of 26 U.S.C. 6041, 6041A, and 6050M, and implementing regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

The evaluation of qualifying proposals will be carried out by the Contracting Officer and other personnel deemed necessary to complete the evaluation.

Technical Evaluation:  The evaluation of each proposal will assess and measure the ability and knowledge of the Offeror to provide the services described above.  In the evaluation of Technical Capability, the evaluator will use the following adjectives and related definitions to define the Technical Capability the proposal possess.
 
RATINGS	EVALUATION CRITERIA

BLUE	Proposal meets all solicitation requirements, demonstrates an excellent  
                     understanding of the requirements, and possesses skills that offer significant   
                     advantages to the Government.  Excellent in all aspects. Advantages/strengths  
                     are not offset by disadvantages/weaknesses.  The proposal demonstrates 
                     technical knowledge of presented courses targeted to an NRCS audience.

GREEN          Proposal meets solicitation requirements and demonstrates an adequate 
                     understanding of the requirements but does not offer significant advantages to  
                     the Government over basic requirements.  Where there were areas of  
                     concern, clarifications given by the Offeror were acceptable.       
                     Disadvantages/weaknesses are not significant.  The proposal demonstrates 
                     technical knowledge of presented courses targeted to a Government audience.

YELLOW	Proposal meets some but not all of the solicitation requirements, but offers 
                      advantages (strengths) outweighing other disadvantages (weaknesses).

PINK	Proposal meets some but not all of the solicitation requirements. Proposal does  
                     not address all required criteria.  Proposal contains errors, omissions or 
                     deficiencies that may be able to be corrected without major rewrite or revision   
                     of proposal.

RED	Proposal demonstrates little or no understanding of the solicitation 
                     requirements; or approach fails to meet acceptable re-configuration 
                     expectations.  Proposal contains major errors, omissions or deficiencies and 
                     these conditions cannot be corrected without major rewrite or resubmission. 
                    There is an unacceptably high degree of risk in meeting the Government’s 
                     requirements.  

An Offeror’s Past/Present Performance will be evaluated at a factor level that most accurately defines the Offeror’s performance considering all potential evaluation criteria identified in the following section.  The evaluation will consider the Offeror’s past/present performance relating to the following factors: 

(1)	Customer Relationship
(2)	Prior Experience
(3)	Adherence to Delivery Schedule
(4)	Ability to Successfully Perform 

In conducting the performance assessment, the Government may use data provided by the Offeror, and/or data obtained from other sources.  The Offeror should provide the Government with not more than 3 (three) of the most current past/present performance references.  A reference name, contact number, phone number, and e-mail address should be submitted to allow the Government to obtain adequate past/present performance information.   

To arrive at a Best Value decision, the Contracting Officer will integrate the evaluation of Technical Capability and Past/Present Performance.  Technical Capability will be rated slightly higher than Past/Present Performance.                                                                                                        

Offerors should provide resumes for the individuals who will actually be performing the work.  In addition, please submit the performance questionnaire to a minimum of three references with instructions to send it to this office upon completion.  

This solicitation incorporates one or more solicitation provisions by reference; with the same force and effect as if they were given if full text. Upon request, the CO will make their full text available.

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals— 
(1) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; 
(2) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; 
(3) &#61551; Are, &#61551; are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and 
(4) &#61551; Have, &#61551; have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. 
(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: 
(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. 
(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. 
(ii) Examples. 
(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. §6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. §6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. 
(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. §6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. 
(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. §362 (the Bankruptcy Code). 
(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126). [The Contracting Officer must list in paragraph (i)(1) any end products being acquired under this solicitation that are included in the List of Products Requiring Contractor Certification as to Forced or Indentured Child Labor, unless excluded at 22.1503(b).]

(2) &#61551; Outside the United States. 
(k) Certificates regarding exemptions from the application of the Service Contract Act. (Certification by the offeror as to its compliance with respect to the contract also constitutes its certification as to compliance by its subcontractor if it subcontracts out the exempt services.) [The contracting officer is to check a box to indicate if paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) applies.] 
[  ] (1) Maintenance, calibration, or repair of certain equipment as described in FAR 22.1003-4(c)(1). The offeror &#61551; does &#61551; does not certify that—

(iv) The compensation (wage and fringe benefits) plan for all service employees performing work under the contract is the same as that used for these employees and equivalent employees servicing commercial customers. 
(3) If paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause applies— 
(i) If the offeror does not certify to the conditions in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) and the Contracting Officer did not attach a Service Contract Act wage determination to the solicitation, the offeror shall notify the Contracting Officer as soon as possible; and 
(ii) The Contracting Officer may not make an award to the offeror if the offeror fails to execute the certification in paragraph (k)(1) or (k)(2) of this clause or to contact the Contracting Officer as required in paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this clause. 
(l) Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) (26 U.S.C. 6109, 31 U.S.C. 7701). (Not applicable if the offeror is required to provide this information to a central contractor registration database to be eligible for award.)

This effort requires intricate knowledge of avionics systems, V-22 avionics simulation and test software, V-22 avionics laboratories, and related products used by the V-22 platform.  The MV-22 platform is in its initial deployment in Iraq; the CV-22 platform just completed its Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT&E) and is expecting its initial deployment in FY09.  It is expected that rapid responses will be required to address issues found during the deployment and testing of the V-22 platforms, and RTSC is the only known source that has the prerequisite knowledge and expertise required to execute the following efforts without significantly impacting schedule and cost constraints of the program: 

(A)	SA/MBFT & MNW – RTSC will provide design, development, integration, and support for the MBFT and MNW systems.  The MBFT effort provides the capability to net enable the MV-22 per the Joint Requirements Oversight Counsel (JROC) approved convergence plan to achieve a single Army – Marine Corps joint blue force situational awareness capability.  The MV-22 will be provided the capability to send, receive and display Blue Force Tracker (BFT) information.  The MNW effort provides the capability for pilots and troops onboard the MV-22 with the capability visualize weather conditions overlaid on a moving map while en route and operating in CONUS.

The Navy intends to award a Sole-Source, Cost Plus Fixed Fee Task Order modification for this requirement.  The estimated period of performance is from 01 March 2009 through 31 December 2009.  The estimated issue date for this modification is 01 March 2009.  If you wish to send in a capability statement to be reviewed for this requirement please contact Daniel Chambers prior to the closing date of this synopsis.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.

Note:  Contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database to be eligible for contract award or payment from any DoD activity.  A determination not to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government is not committed nor obligated to pay for the information provided and no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of this synopsis.

STATEMENT OF WORK

1.	BACKGROUND 

FOH is a service unit within the Department of Health and Human Services’ Program Support Center.   FOH works in partnership with Federal organizations nationally to design and deliver comprehensive solutions to meet their occupational health needs. 
Created in 1946 by an amendment to the Public Health Service Act, FOH has more than sixty years of experience providing services exclusively to Federal agencies. In 1984, FOH became fully reimbursable, operating free of congressional appropriations. This means that FOH operates like a business within the government and charges fellow government agencies for the services it provides them. 

FOH provides occupational health (OH) consultation and stimulates the development of improved OH and safety programs throughout the Federal Government. FOH utilizes a comprehensive approach with a public health perspective and, in alliance with Federal Government agencies, seeks to improve the health and safety of the Federal Government work force. FOH assists Federal Government managers in establishing OH services for Federal employees through the assessment and monitoring of environmental hazards for special classes of employees, appraisal of program compliance with mandated and voluntary OH standards, counseling for employees at risk from alcoholism, drug abuse, stress, or other job-related factors, screening for maintenance of a drug-free workplace, and promotion of employee wellness and
physical fitness.

FOH is the single largest provider of OH services in the Federal Government, serving more than 360 Federal Government agencies and departments and reaching more than 1.5 million Federal Government employees. FOH provides these services to other Federal agencies under individual 100% reimbursable Economy Act Interagency Agreements. Agreements are negotiated with Federal Government Departments’ and Agencies’ national headquarters, and/or with their regional/local components. Some agreements contain a standard package of OH program components; others contain an array of services and consultations tailored to particular OH or environmental needs. FOH Service Provision Sites (SPSs) include more than 260 FOH Health Centers (OHCs) throughout the United States, and a private provider network (FOHNET), providing comprehensive health and wellness services. 

2.	PURPOSE 

The purpose of this acquisition is to provide medical services including the administration of Hepatitis A, B and combo, tetanus, Td, and PPD plus audiograms and venipunctures.  These services will be provided to law enforcement agents of Federal agencies who train at FLETC and who have an interagency agreement with FOH.
These services must be provided in the Occupational Health Clinic on the campus of the FLETC training facilities at Glynco, GA and Artesia, NM.  

3.	SPECIFIC TASKS 

FOH requires the following services to be delivered on the FLETC campuses to law enforcement agents of several customer agencies.  The majority will be at the Artesia campus and the rest at the Glynco campus.

PPD - tuberculosis test
Td   -- Tetanus and diphtheria injection only

These services are standard in the medical industry.  FOH provides a document called a Workorder that gives more specifics about each item.  There is one attached to this SOW as an example.  The line items would be the same for each agencies serviced.  FOH provides the vaccine and supplies for these from Perry Point. These supplies will be ordered and shipped to the FLETC OHCs.    The vendor is bidding on the labor required to administer them to the agents.   The services must be provided within the tight time constraints of the agent’s schedule during the training programs offered at FLETC.  These services must be provided in a medical clinic that meets all occupational health industry standards for providing screenings and immunizations.

    (a) Prohibitions. 
    Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395, prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause or with any subsidiary of such an entity. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. 
    (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 
    Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears. 
    Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395 would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
    Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)— 
    (1)  The entity completes the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; 
    (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity 
is held— 
In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or
    (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
    (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliate. 
    Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 
    (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 
    (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
    (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
incorporated entity; or 
    (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b)(1).    
    (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b) (2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.     (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.
    (d) Special rule for related partnerships.  For purposes of applying section 835(b) of the Homeland Security Act, 6 U.S.C. 395(b) to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. 
    (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
    (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
    (i) Warrants; 
    (ii) Options; 
    (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; 
    (iv) Convertible debt instruments; 
    (v) Others similar interests. 
    (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835.

Firms will be selected based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required primarily to support the in-house design resources for civil works, VA and military projects that require a design that results in Plans and Specifications and detailed Estimates for a Construction Project, Planning/Feasibility study or pre-design documentations, however, should the need arise and the in-house resources are totally committed, the services may include the full spectrum of design disciplines on all or portions of complete projects. Projects will primarily be located within the South Pacific Divisions civil works boundaries of the San Francisco District. The contracts may also be used by other Districts within South Pacific Division (Sacramento, Los Angeles and Albuquerque Districts) to encompass the entire South Pacific Division geographical area of responsibility which can include work within CA, NV, AZ and portions of OR, ID, CO and WY. <br /><br />The North American Industrial Classification System code (NAICS) is 541310, which has a small business size standard of maximum $4.0 million of average annual receipts for its preceding 3 fiscal years. More than one firm will be selected from this announcement and it is anticipated that up to four contracts will be awarded. One of these contracts will be set aside for the highest qualified small business. The remaining contracts shall be awarded to firms regardless of size and based on the qualification rankings. These resulting Firm-fixed price Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contracts will be negotiated and the first is anticipated to be awarded in April 2009 or earlier. Since more than one contract will be awarded as a result of this announcement for the same or similar work, selection for task order awards will be made as follows: (1) All awardees will be given a fair opportunity to be considered for each task order award in excess of $2,500. (2) In making selection of the awardees to receive a specific task order, the Contracting Officer will consider past performance of previous task orders, quality of previous task orders, timeliness of previous task orders, cost control, the firms strength and previous experience in relation to the work requirements and geographic location described in the scope of work for each task order.

Individual task orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount. The options may be exercised at the discretion of the Government. At the discretion of the Government, the option periods may be exercised early if the annual Total Estimated Price is exhausted or nearly exhausted. All pricing schedules (for base year, and option periods) will be effective for one full year, regardless of the early exercising of options, beginning with the date of award of the base year. The pricing schedules for the first, second, third, and fourth option periods become effective on the 1st,2nd, 3rd, and 4th anniversary dates, respectively, of the contract award. If the Total Estimated Price of the base year or any option year is not awarded within that year's 12-month performance period and the Government has elected to exercise a subsequent option year, the remaining unused dollar amount may be added on to the Total Estimated Price of the option period being exercised. Task Orders shall not exceed the annual contract amount. This announcement is open to all firms regardless of size.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC>Please find the RFP attached.  Proposals are due no later than 1:00 PM, Friday, January 23, 2009.  Proposals are to be delivered to 1340 Braddock PLACE, Alexandria, VA  22314. Electronic submission of propsals is not authorized.  

(Please note the original SF33 stated the delivery address as 1340 Braddock Road, however, the correct address is 1340 Braddock PLACE.)

The Defense Security Service (DSS) plans to award a firm fixed price level of effort contract for counterintelligence analyst services.  The award will be for a base year with options for increased level of effort and for additional analyst positions.   The NAICS code for this solicitation is 541990.  This requirement is a small business set aside.

The proposed acquisition is for seven counterintelligence analysts to provide technical and analytical intelligence/counterintelligence support to supplement the DSS Counterintelligence Office federal workforce.  Work will include analyzing and evaluating raw data collected from established sources to produce finished intelligence on geographic or functional areas, identification of intelligence gaps in collecting information and making recommendations for corrective action.  Contractor employees must have a top secret/SCI clearance prior to beginning work on the contract.  The place of performance for this contract will be at DSS headquarters in Alexandria, VA, Columbus, Ohio and Linthicum Md.  However, due to the agency’s anticipated BRAC moves, these locations will change, respectively, to Quantico, VA, Fort Meade, Md. and Quantico VA sometime in 2011.  DSS will make award to the responsible offeror who conforms to the solicitation and provides the best value to the Government. 

Contractors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to doing business with DSS.  For additional information and to register in CCR, please visit www.ccr.gov.

Synopsis Adjustments, Questions and Answers

The Contracting Officer is issuing amendment one, to Synopsis AE-R2-0001.  This amendment is to clarify, add to, or adjust some portions of the synopsis.

1.)  The correct phone number to contact contracting officer Kirk Roegner is 303-275-5288

2.)  The term “portfolio” should be interpreted to mean your proposal, to include everything from your cover page, your complete 330's, any requirement as outlined in the instructions and any other information your firm deems appropriate to provide within the given page limits.  Covers and dividers do not count toward the number of portfolio pages.

3.)  Where it is stated the “entire proposal should not exceed 40 double-sided pages”, there is a new limit, the proposal should not exceed 50 double sided pages, meaning, 50 sheets, 100 pages when using both sides

4.)  The solicitation requests SF330 forms for all sub-consultants; only part II is requested for sub-consultants.  Subcontractor(s) portfolios should consist of no more than 5 projects with a maximum page count of 30 double sided pages, meaning, 30 sheets, 60 pages if you use both sides.

5.)  No cost or pricing proposals shall be submitted at this time

6.)  Question:  The solicitation currently directs that “responses must be received NLT 4:00 pm, Mountain Time, January 31, 2009. January 31 is a Saturday. Please confirm or advise the correct due date of the response submittal package.  Answer:  The portfolio/synopsis package due date is changed to Friday, February 6, 2009, NLT 4:00 pm, Mountain Time.

7.)  Question:  In the second to last paragraph you ask for 'state registration numbers' in Block 30 - are you looking for our business registration numbers or architect/engineer license numbers?  In just the states listed in the ad - or all states where we are registered to do business.  If you could provide some clarification that would really help. Answer:  The synopsis is amended to delete this sentence: 
“Please include your DUNS, CAGE, TIN, and State Registration numbers in Block 30 of the SF330.”  Complete Part I, Section E. Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed for This Contract, and indicate the current professional registration (State and Discipline) where indicated on the form and include NCARB, NCEES and CLARB registration under Other Professional Qualifications.  Professional registrations may be required in any State or possession of the United States, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia and will be specified in the individual task orders.  As noted in the synopsis, the majority of the work will be located in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico.  A DUNs number is required on Part II. 

8.)  Question:  The solicitation requests only 6 projects are shown to identify past experience in the SF330, though the solicitation lists at least 14 different project types, and a similar number of disciplines. May we illustrate experience in supplemental attachments to demonstrate experience in all of these project type and discipline areas? Are there any limitations to what may be included in supplemental information beyond the formatting and page limits stated in the solicitation?  Answer:  This is an amendment; the limit of pages has been increased to 50 pages, double sided for your qualification portfolio, including the SF 330; dividers and covers don’t count in the tally.  You must stay within the stated parameters, to include supplemental attachments or any other document.  There should be plenty of additional space within that given limitation.  Firms should address issues they feel are pertinent as outlined in this acquisition; for example, perhaps your wish to illustrate experience in all project types and disciplines.

9.)  Question:  Does the phrase "40 double-sided pages" mean a total of 40 physical pages, with 2 sides per page, resulting in 80 available "image" sheets, or does it mean 20 physical pages, with 2 sides per page, for a total of 40 "image" sheets?  On the 40 double side page limitation - does that count the cover, cover letter, section divider tabs and back cover.  Answer:  You get 50 physical sheets with two sides per page resulting in 100 image sheets.

10.)  Question:  This unrestricted, full and open solicitation is silent on small business utilization goals. Is this correct? Please clarify.  Answer:  Yes, you are correct, no small business utilization goals will be sought, per regulation, this acquisition is full and open.

11.)  Question:  I don’t see any indication that there are any small business, DBE or MBE requirements for this solicitation? Are there any preferences or targets for participation in any of these areas?  Answer:  As stated in the synopsis, this acquisition has been determined to be "full & open", no set-asides.

12.)  Question:  It is unclear if only small businesses (Classification code 541310) need apply? It is not mentioned specifically in the published narrative; however the classification code and standard business size is called out.  Answer:  This acquisition is full and open, please see paragraph 4, it is stated "this acquisition is not set-aside and is unrestricted, full and open competition".  The size standard does not apply to full and open acquisitions; it serves in a small-business set-aside as a threshold to determine what is and what isn’t a small business. 

13.a.)  Question:  We are architects in California with abundant experience working on assignments through IDIQs with public agencies such as the USFS, USDA, NPS and Coast Guard.  Would our location in California disqualify or otherwise disadvantage us in our application for the contract regarding Pre-Solicitation AE-R2-0001 ?
13.b.)  Question:  I see a note that projects may be located throughout the US, with a possible 
concentration in the USFS Rocky Mountain and Southwest Regions. What licenses/registrations for architects, engineers and landscape architects will be required for this response? 50 states? All states in the region? Any states in the region? Is NCARB, NCEES, and/or CLARB registration sufficient to demonstrate licenses can be obtained in states where they may be required?
13.c.)  Question:  Is it necessary that our engineers and architects be licensed/registered in every state listed for the region?  Answer:  Complete Part I, Section E. Resumes of Key Personnel Proposed for This Contract, and indicate the current professional registration (State and Discipline) where indicated on the form and include NCARB, NCEES and CLARB registration under Other Professional Qualifications.  Professional registrations may be required in any State or possession of the United States, Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia and will be specified in the individual task orders.  As noted in the synopsis, the majority of the work will be located in Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico.  

14.)  Question:  The document states that the work may involve site planning (among many other services).  Our team has interpreted this to mean “master planning.”  For this solicitation, is there a distinction between site planning and master planning?  What services does the Forest Service associate with “site planning?”  Answer:  Site planning is referring to planning for a specific site that will lead to preliminary design and ultimately construction of a project.

15.)  Question:  Evaluation Factor 5 focuses only on the Rocky Mountain Region, with regard to location of the consultants and sub-consultants. The Southwest Region is not addressed even though it is mentioned earlier in the synopsis in the paragraph that addresses project work locations. Please clarify.  Answer:  Although work will occur in the Southwest Region, the majority of work will occur in the Rocky Mountain Region and will most likely be managed out of the Rocky Mountain Regional Office.  Evaluation Factor #5 will remain as currently stated in the synopsis.

16.a.)  Question:  I’m not entirely sure what to make of criteria #5 that states: “Location of the 
consultant and Sub-consultants relative to the National Forests and Grasslands throughout the Rocky Mountain Region and knowledge of the locality of the projects.” Does this require having worked in all of the states in the Rocky Mountain region is required, or working in areas that may have similar climates as the forests and grasslands? Is work environments in the Southwest Region also required (though not stated) since the concentration of projects may also include the Southwest Region? 
16.b.)Utah and Idaho, where we currently have offices and have serviced projects in National Forest areas, though central to all of the states in the two regions, is not within the specific regions mentioned. Will this competitively disadvantage us over a firm say in South Dakota, which is in one of the regions, though may be less accessible to all parts of the two regions where projects may be concentrated? Should we provide detailed information about drive or flight times to various forests and grasslands within the two regions to specifically document accessibility to serve those areas?  Answer:  There is no requirement to have worked in any or all the states in the Rocky Mountain Region, or anywhere else specifically.  Under evaluation factor 5, all regional variances and information will be considered; however as indicated in the synopsis, locality is of interest to our requirement, hence an evaluation factor (albeit, note it is the lowest rating factor of all).

17.)  Question:  The solicitation currently directs responders to “submit four copies of SF 330 (parts I and II) as well as responses to the evaluation criteria outlined above”. We would expect to respond to your evaluation criteria to include the Organization Chart within the established sections of Part I of the SF 330. Are you expecting the responders’ submittals to contain more than the SF 330 Parts I and II, Organization Chart aside?  Answer:  The submittal should include responses to the evaluation criteria in Section H of Part 1.  Only one organization chart attached to Part I is required.  Submittal should not exceed 50 double-sided pages total.

18.)  Question:  Copies of the SF330 are also required for sub-consultants'.  Normally we integrate the consultants into our SF330 Part I, and then provide a Part II document for each sub.  With the 80 page limit (40 double sided), do you really want complete SF330's for each sub - if we have 4, 5, 6 consultants it will be very difficult to hit 80 pages as there will be a lot of duplication. In the same paragraph it also states 'the portfolio should consist of no more than six projects'.  Normally we present projects in Section F of the SF 330 and typically 10 projects are requested.  Is this the 'portfolio' that is referenced in the above statement - and if so are we to limit that information to six projects?  Or, is there another portfolio that you are requesting - if so please advise on what information is being requested there.  Answer:  Only the prime contractor should complete Part I of SF 330.  The 6 example projects and associated key personnel are to be addressed in Sections F and G, respectively in Part 1.  Evaluation criteria responses should be addressed in Section H of Part 1. Any additional information may also be provided in Section H of Part 1. Prepare a separate Part II for each firm (ie. prime contractor, branch offices, joint venture partners, subcontractors, etc) that will be proposed for performance of this contract and submit them with the Part 1. The complete submittal cannot exceed 50 double-sided pages.

19.)  Question:  SECTION G - KEY PERSONNEL PARTICIPATION IN EXAMPLE PROJECTS generally asks for 10 projects but in the solicitation it states to show no more than six projects.  Is this correct?  Answer:  Yes, 10 projects is optional for the agency to choose, we only want to hear about your previous six.

20.)  Question:  Is interpretive planning and design a required discipline?  If so, is the interpretive firm allowed to complete both design and fabrication, or just design?  Answer:  Fabrication is not an A&E function and would not be allowed. 

21.)  Question:  Will the contract be available for other federal agencies to utilize?  Answer:  Not at this time; however, if the need ever arose, it could be considered.

22.)  Question:  Due to the page count restriction, do you want a complete SF 330 for each consultant or just resumes and 6 projects for each?  Answer:  Please read the instructions for Standard Form(SF) 330.  Only the prime contractor should complete Part I of SF 330.  The 6 example projects and associated key personnel are to be addressed in Sections F and G, respectively in Part 1.  Evaluation criteria responses should be addressed in Section H of Part 1. Any additional information may also be provided in Section H of Part 1. Prepare a separate Part II for each firm (ie. prime contractor, branch offices, joint venture partners, subcontractors, etc) that will be proposed for performance of this contract and submit them with the Part 1. The complete submittal cannot exceed 50 double-sided pages.   

23.)  Question:  The solicitation currently directs responders to “submit four copies of SF 330 (parts I and II) as well as responses to the evaluation criteria outlined above”. We would expect to respond to your evaluation criteria to include the Organization Chart within the established sections of Part I of the SF 330. Are you expecting the responders’ submittals to contain more than the SF 330 Parts I and II, Organization Chart aside?  Answer:  The submittal should include responses to the evaluation criteria in addition to the SF 330 Parts I and II.  Only one organization chart attached to Part I is required.  Submittal should not exceed 50 double-sided pages. 

24.)  Question:  if it could be verified weather or not the submittal is requiring a A-E team or if the services can be submitted only for engineering.  Any clarification on this would be much appreciated.  Answer:  Consultant can offer only engineering services.  

25.)  Question:  The solicitation states ” …submit four copies of the Standard Form (SF) 330, parts I and II, as well as responses to the evaluation criteria outlined above.”   My question is, “Does your office prefer a submittal where the SF 330 is simply an appendix to the overall submittal, or where the submittal is the SF330 and the responses to Criteria are contained in Section H – Additional Information?”  Answer:  The submittal should only include SF 330 parts I and II.  Evaluation criteria responses should be addressed in Section H of Part 1.  Any additional information may also be provided in Section H of Part 1 within the maximum number of pages.

26.)  Question:  For the 6 projects to be included in the portfolio, we have a similar question.  We are reading into this that only the 6 projects should be reflected in the SF330 Parts F and G.  Is it your intent that the Example Project Portfolio be limited to parts F and G of the SF330?  This sort of goes back to question 1 above.  Answer:  The 6 example projects and associated key personnel are to be addressed in Sections F and G in Part 1.  Any additional information may also be provided in Section H of Part 1 within the maximum number of pages.

27.)  Question:  The document states that the work may involve site planning (among many other services).  Our team has interpreted this to mean “master planning.”  For this solicitation, is there a distinction between site planning and master planning?  What services does the Forest Service associate with “site planning?”  Answer:  Site planning is referring to planning for a specific site that will lead to preliminary design and ultimately construction of a project.
 
28.)  Question:  Selection Criteria #3 lists key technical personnel that may be included in this 
contract. From our experience in similar IDIQs and the types of projects listed in this scope of work, we feel that this contract may require additional disciplines. May we present these as well?  Answer:  Yes, we may add other disciplines not specifically identified in the synopsis.
 
29.)  Question:  If additional disciplines are included it may warrant an increase in the page limit. Will responses in excess of the suggested 40 double-sided pages be disqualified?  Answer:  The number of pages has been increased to 50 double-sided pages.  The complete submittal cannot exceed 50 double-sided pages.   
 
30.)  Question:  Can you clarify the statement that copies of the SF 330 are also required for sub-consultants?  Are we to submit a separate SF330 Part I (Items A-H) for each sub-consultant or can we incorporate their Part I Items E, F, G and H into the team SF330; and submit separate SF330 Part II for each sub-consultant?  Answer:  Only the prime contractor should submit Part I of SF 330.  Prepare a separate Part II for each firm that will be proposed for this contract and submit with the Part 1.
 
31.)  Question:  If you require a complete SF330 Part I and Part II for each sub-consultant, does the 40 double sided page limit include all of the sub-consultants SF330s?  Answer:  Part 1 of the SF 330 is not required for sub-consultants. The complete submittal cannot exceed 50 double-sided pages.   
 
32.)  Question:  The solicitation states responses must be received by January 31.  Since January 31 is a Sunday, will the deadline be February 2 instead?  Answer:  Deadline has been extended to Friday, February 6, 2009, NLT 4:00 pm, Mountain Time.

<DESC><p>Sources Sought Notice No.: SS-ETSB-91014-56
<p>Project Title: Support for Research on Retroviral Pathogenesis, Treatment and Prevention</p>
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business concern; (2) whether they are small business; HUBZone small business; service-disabled, veteran-owned small business; 8(a) small business; veteran-owned small business; woman-owned small business; or small disadvantage business; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>The NAICS code for this project is 541380.<br />The small business size standard is $12 million in annual receipts.</p>
<p>Background<br />A contract previously supported research of the Section on Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines (AMRV) and the Section on Immune Biology of Retroviral Infection (IBRI) within the Basic Research Laboratory, NCI. When the Vaccine Branch (VB) was created within the Cancer for Center Research (CCR), the contract was available for use not only by the AMRV and the IBRI, but also the Human Retrovirus Section, the Human Retrovirus Pathogenesis Section, and the Molecular Immunogenetic and Vaccine Research Section. A key area of research in the VB involves retroviruses, particularly HIV, the causative agent of AIDS, and SIV, the related monkey virus which provides a model for detailed experimental investigations. Other viruses are studied as well, including HTLV-1/2, and viruses used as vaccine vectors. Vaccine approaches are a major area of research, however studies on viral pathogenesis and treatment are also on-going. Previous contracts have provided critical support to these research endeavors. Contract activities have included provisions of retroviruses, purified retroviral and cellular proteins, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies and cell culture support; and performance of assays to assess the immunological status of research subjects and the virological status of cells and tissues in vivo and in vitro.</p>
<p>This work is currently being conducted under contract N02-RC-47703 held by Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc.</p>
<p>Definitions<br />HIV Human Immunedeficiency Virus<br />SIV Simmian Immunedeficiency Virus<br />HTLV-1/2 Human T-cell leukemia virus type I and II<br />DNA Deoxyribonucleic acid<br />PCR Polymerace Chain Reaction<br />Purpose and Objectives<br />The purpose of this project is to provide support for research on retroviral (specifically HIV and HTLV) pathogenesis and vaccine development in the areas of virology, immunology, protein biochemistry, and molecular biology. Virologic support is needed for isolation and characterization of retroviruses, development of viral stocks for in vitro assays, and in support of studies on viral variation and evolution and pathogenesis studies. Immunologic support is needed for evaluation of immunity elicited by candidate vaccines, seroprevalence studies of retroviruses as well as vaccine vectors, and elucidation of correlates of protective efficacy. The protein biochemistry component is critical as it is needed to provide purified proteins and peptides for use as immunogens and as reagents for evaluation of candidate vaccines. Molecular biologic support is essential for quantitative assessment of viral loads in vaccine and pathogenesis studies and for provision of nucleic acid reagents.</p>
<p>Project requirements</p>
<p>Major tasks required of the Contractor include the following:<br />1) Prepare and provide large bulk amount of B or T cell lines from blood of non-human primates or humans <br />2) Conduct in vitro culture and detection of retroviruses from peripheral blood and/or tissues of humans or animals, the latter including rodents, leporidiae and non-human primates.<br />3) Provide tittered stocks of field isolates for in vitro use form virus-infected humans and non-human primates at low passage number on human or non-human primate Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC).<br />4) Provide purified and tittered stocks of attenuated and vaccinia virus recombinants as requested by the Project Officer. The initial viral inocula shall be provided by the Government.<br />5) Conduct in vitro assays to assess the serologic status of human or animal sample donors, to evaluate the prevalence of virus present within its host population, and to evaluate secretion of cytokines. <br />6) Purify lymphocytes from blood, lymph nodes or other tissues from animal or humans and provide fresh and viable to the government.<br />7) Provide purified, biochemically characterized and biologically active native viral or cellular proteins from viruses, infected cells, or conditioned media and from bacterial or mammalian expression systems.<br />8) Design codon-optimized genes encoding cellular or viral proteins for eukaryotic or prokaryotic expression.<br />9) Provide overlapping peptides representing proteins from the HIV, SIV, HTLV-1/2, or adenovirus genomes.<br />10) Provide pre-clinical grade plasmid DNA containing minimal levels of endotoxin and encoding HIV and SIV genes for vaccine studies.<br />11) Purify and quantitate mRNA in plasma or tissue samples of animals or humans by real time PCR.<br />12) Conduct assays to quantitate proviral DNA load by real time PCR for SIV or HTLV-1/2 from cells of non-human primates.<br />13) Provide characterized monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to proteins of interest for use in affinity purifications, immunologic characterizations, and for VB use.<br />14) Provide long-term storage for viable cell lines, tittered field isolates, viral challenge stocks and viable cell specimens from inoculated and immunized animals.</p>
<p>Tissues and blood cells required in the performance of the above tasks will be provided by the Government.</p>
<p>As part of the work under this potential contract semiannual and final technical report are expected.</p>
<p>Other important considerations<br />All biological materials delivered will need to be packaged in appropriate containers and delivered according to Department of Transportation regulations.</p>
<p>This work requires the Contractor to have or establish biocontainment (BSL2 with BSL3 capability) in order to conduct work with human retroviruses and non-human primate retroviruses (HIV, SIV, SHIV, HTLV -1/2) adenovirus, and poxviruses.</p>
<p>This work also requires the delivery of fresh, viable cells and biologically active purified proteins to Bethesda, Maryland within one hour after preparation and the pickup of fresh, viable cells and tissues from primates maintained by the Government in Rockville, Maryland within one hour of notice of harvest by the Government.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance<br />The anticipated period of performance for this requirement is one year, with four one-year options.</p>
<p>Capability statement/information sought.<br />Interested qualified small business organizations should submit a tailored capability<br />statement for this requirement, not to exceed 20 single-sided pages (including all<br />attachments, resumes, charts, etc.) presented in single-space and using a 12-point font<br />size minimum, that clearly details the ability to perform the aspects of the notice<br />described above.

<DESC>The posting date of the above referenced BAA is to be determined (TBD).

Reverse Osmosis (RO) desalination has become the Navy standard for the shipboard production of freshwater since its introduction into the Navy in the early 1990s.  RO plants have provided significant operational and cost benefits over conventional distillers which have been used on Navy ships since before the introduction of steam propulsion.  These benefits include reduced monitoring and manpower requirements and significant reductions in operational costs including: reduced power requirements, independence from ship steam systems, reduction in the use of chemical additives, and large improvements in reliability and maintainability.  Over the past two decades, there has been a large increase in the use of membrane based separations for both liquid and gas streams, much of this due to technical advancements such as improved membranes and pumps, novel membrane topologies and operational approaches, and staged separation processes.  The Office of Naval Research has encouraged such technology development through the Expeditionary Unit Water Purification (EUWP) research program.  It is the goal of the BAA to further develop promising water purification and desalination technologies, on a component and not a complete system level, over a two year period to a readiness level that would be appropriate for consideration for use in a robust shipboard desalination system.  It is anticipated that there will be a second program to build complete shipboard desalination systems to a Technical Readiness Level 6, possibly using technologies matured during this program. (A description of Technical Readiness Levels is available at: http://www.onr.navy.mil/ctto/naval_needs.asp)

Major areas of focus include: advanced pretreatment; advanced chemical pretreatment enhancements; advanced reverse osmosis membranes; advanced energy recovery systems; and alternative approaches to desalination, pretreatment.

Industry Day will be held at the Asilomar Conference Center in Pacific Grove, CA on 25 February 2009 from 1:00 p.m. to 5:30 p.m (Pacific). Details concerning registration are available at the meeting website:  https://www.onr.navy.mil/about/events/regdetail.asp?cid=494
Registration shall be completed by 4:00 p.m. (Eastern) on 20 February 2009. If requested attendance exceeds the capacity of the conference room, it will be necessary to limit attendance of personnel from each organization. All expenses associated with attendance will be the responsibility of the participant(s).

<SUBJECT>POINT OF CARE OR HIGH-THROUGHPUT BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS FOR DETERMINING ABSORBED IONIZING RADIATION DOSE (BIODOSIMETRY) AFTER RADIOLOGIC AND NUCLEAR EVENTS
<SOLNBR>BAA-BARDA-09-36
<CONTACT>Carl A. Newman, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-1156 , Fax 202-205-4520, Email carl.newman@hhs.gov - Schuyler T Eldridge, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-260-1554, Fax 202-205-4520, Email schuyler.eldridge@hhs.gov
<DESC>The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), within the Office of
the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services (HHS), provides an integrated, systematic approach to the
development and purchase of the necessary vaccines, drugs, therapies, and diagnostic tools for
public health medical emergencies.
BARDA’s mission includes managing the advanced research and development of medical
countermeasures (MCM) for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear agents (CBRN). As
part of its CBRN development and preparedness mission, BARDA announces a program to
encourage research and development aimed at physical and biological dosimetry technologies
useful in initial triage or definitive medical management after radiological and nuclear events. A
large-scale radiological incident would result in an immediate critical need to assess the
radiation doses potentially received by thousands of individuals. This will require a system
architecture or a system of platforms that contains diverse, integrated diagnostic and dosimetric
tools that are accurate and precise. For large-scale events, rapidity and ease of screening are
essential in enabling appropriate triage and treatment decisions.
The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) entitled, “POINT OF CARE OR HIGHTHROUGHPUT
BIOLOGICAL ASSAYS FOR DETERMINING ABSORBED IONIZING
RADIATION DOSE (BIODOSIMETRY) AFTER RADIOLOGIC AND NUCLEAR EVENTS” is to
fund advanced development of innovative physical and biological dosimetry tools and devices,
biomarkers, and bioassays including the development of new indications for already licensed or
cleared products. These tools and devices, biomarkers, bioassays will be used following a
nuclear detonation, use of a radiologic dispersive device (RDD, “dirty bomb”), or other
radiological incident for the assessment of an individual’s absorbed dose of ionizing radiation.
In a mass casualty setting, medical resources will likely be overextended, and comprehensive
clinical and laboratory evaluations to ascertain the subject’s absorbed dose will be critical to
assess medical management needs and appropriate medical countermeasure dosing. In such
circumstances, rapid radiation dosimetry tools will be critically important, particularly in cases
where the demand for approved medical radiation countermeasures and medical attention
exceeds their supply. Rational allocation of such scarce resources will be virtually impossible in
the absence of rapid, reliable diagnostics.

It is the intention of this BAA to award contracts to provide funding for Offerors to advance lead
candidate products in the development pipeline. Each lead candidate product must be
developed to serve as a tool or device, biomarker, or bioassay useful for accurate determination
of a subject’s absorbed dose of ionizing radiation. Advanced development funding from BARDA
shall assist selected candidate products through the Pre-Market Approval (PMA) process with
the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiologic Health (CDRH)
and any commensurate studies using the Animal Rule as directed with the Agency’s Centers for
Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
(CBER).
Offerors are invited to submit proposals that request funding to advance the development of a
promising diagnostic product that addresses this specific research and development area.
Offerors shall propose a well-defined product development path that must include completion
and validation, and potentially approval/clearance, of a prototype instrument or bioassay prior to
or within the five (5) years of the contract period. Performance of studies using vertebrate
animals will be done under the Animal Rule, i.e. 21 CFR §601) and potential clinical studies
must be consistent with all applicable Federal regulations and BARDA/NIH policies and
guidelines for the conduct and oversight of research in vertebrate animals and human subjects.
This announcement will also support product development activities that are enabling for FDA
approval or license of tools, devices, and bioassays, including:
1) Prototype development and manufacturing scale-up of the tool, device, or bioassay.
2) Animal studies required to support the PMA under the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) “Animal Rule” (21 CFR §601; New Drug and Biological Drug
Products; Evidence Needed to Demonstrate Effectiveness of New Drugs When Human
Efficacy Studies Are Not Ethical or Feasible: http://www.fda.gov/cber/rules/humeffic.pdf .
Offerors may submit one proposal per designated product entity that addresses the intent of the
BAA and focuses on the development of a single product. However, Offerors may submit more
than one proposal.
Once a novel radiation-responsive biomarker is qualified, the development of a diagnostic test
and the validation of a biomarker(s) assay will usually fall under OIVD (Office of In Vitro
Diagnostic Device Evaluation and Safety) (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/oivd) / for clearance or
approval of diagnostic tests that measure biomarkers in a clinical setting. The web site “Device
Advice” is available from the FDA at http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice, for useful information
about the regulation and review of medical devices, including in vitro diagnostic devices.
It is anticipated that studies in this contract will involve novel radiation-responsive biomarkers
and bioassays which will involve animal studies under the FDA’s “Animal Rule” (21 CFR §601)
for the generation of radiation-responsive biomarkers to known doses of ionizing radiation.
These studies are expected to be supported using Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committees (IACUC) as endorsed by the US Food and Drug Administration
(http://www.iacuc.org/index.htm), the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW)
(http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm), and overseen by the US Department of Agriculture
(USDA) (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_welfare/index.shtml ).
The following types of proposals are not responsive to this initiative:
The development of tools, devices and bioassays intended solely for occupational
radiation exposures (<100 mSv),
The development of devices or bioassays with high levels of inter-individual variability;
The development of devices or bioassays using biomarkers with highly unstable signal
(i.e. appear and diminish in < 24 hours post-exposure to ionizing radiation),
 The development of devices or bioassays that cannot be utilized in order to estimate
whole-body absorbed dose, and
 Proposals involving the development of animal models for bioassay discovery unless the
models are directly relevant to the dosimetric product development.
Although the above mentioned research and development areas are not responsive to this
announcement, they may be relevant to other BARDA or NIAID Biodefense research and
development programs. A listing of such programs can be found on the BARDA web site
http://www.hhs.gov/aspr/barda or the NIAID Biodefense funding website:
http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/
The class to which your device is assigned determines, among other things, the type of
premarketing submission/application required for FDA clearance to market
(http://www.fda.gov/CDRH/DEVADVICE/3122.html). Device product classifications can be
found by searching the Product Classification Database,
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPCD/classification.cfm. The database
search provides the name of the device, classification, and a link to the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR), if any. The CFR provides the device type name, identification of the device,
and classification information.
For each of the devices classified by the FDA, the CFR gives a general description including
the intended use, the class to which the device belongs (i.e., Class I, II, or III), and information
about marketing requirements. Each device should meet the definition in a classification
regulation contained in 21 CFR 862-892(see FDA web site:
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/devadvice/313.html). If a Premarket Approval (PMA) is not required, the
Offeror’s must submit a 510(k) to FDA unless the device is exempt from 510(k) requirements of
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and the device does not exceed the
limitations of exemptions in .9 of the device classification regulation chapters (e.g., 21 CFR
862.9, 21 CFR 864.9). Before marketing a device, each submitter must receive an order, in the
form of a letter, from FDA which finds the device to be Substantially Equivalent, and states that
the device can be marketed in the U.S. This order "clears" the device for commercial
distribution.
In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD)
IVDs are medical devices that analyze human body fluids, such as blood or urine, to provide
information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a disease. The device classification for
these devices can be found under 21 CFR 862, 21 CFR 864, and 21 CFR 866.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA) of 1988
In addition to FDA regulation under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, IVD devices are also
subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988. This law
established quality standards for laboratory testing and an accreditation program for clinical
laboratories.
The requirements that apply vary according to the technical complexity in the testing process
and risk of harm in reporting erroneous results. The regulations established three categories of

testing on the basis of the complexity of the testing methodology: a) waived tests, b) tests of
moderate complexity, and c) tests of high complexity. Laboratories performing moderate- or
high-complexity testing or both must meet requirements for proficiency testing, patient test
management, quality control, quality assurance, and personnel. These specific requirements do
not apply to tests in the waived category.
Product Complexity Database
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCLIA/search.cfm
Labeling
Specific labeling requirements for IVDs can be found under 21 CFR 809. Additional guidance
can be found under "Device Advice - Labeling Requirements for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices."
