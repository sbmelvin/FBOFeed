<DESC>THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY FOR A LABOR HOUR CONTRACT WITH TRAVEL (IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL TRAVEL REGULATIONS) FOR CONTRACT AUDIT SERVICES.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from firms capable of performing government contract/contractor audit and advisory services nationwide.  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has audit responsibility cognizance over certain vendors who primarily hold contracts with the FAA.  The agency has a requirement for audit support services to assist in Government contract audits and attestation engagements, such as examinations, and provide an opinion and agreed upon procedures performed in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS).  These services include, but are not limited to:  examination of proposals, incurred costs, interim and final contract billings, contract audit closing statements, financial capability, accounting systems, estimating systems, purchasing systems and other internal controls within the contractors operational environment.  Non-audit services include, but are not limited to:  comparison of accounting practices used for proposals against incurred costs, verification of direct/indirect costs with the way they are recorded in the books and records, verification of labor rate calculations, and verification of proposed or claimed amounts to supporting data.

FAA anticipates task orders to primarily focus on contractor incurred cost audits in compliance with (GAGAS) and Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit programs and methodologies/definitions per the DCAA Contract Audit Manual.

In order to make a capability determination and to be considered eligible for participation in a subsequent request for proposals should one occur, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

(A)	Capability statement that specifically identifies your experience in the types of audit service the FAA is looking for via this survey.  This document should identify:
a.	Type of services provided by your firm
b.	Size/value and type of services provided by previous contracts.  Provide specific contract numbers, contact names, addresses and email information to support claimed capabilities
c.	Number of years in business
(B)	Work Samples.  Copies of 2 (two) audit reports prepared by your firm of audits performed by your firm.  Redact references to the company audited/contract numbers as these documents may reference proprietary financial/rate information.  Samples may be for 2 incurred cost audits or 1 (one) incurred cost audit and one of the audits referenced below.
a.	An Incurred Cost Audit (Note:  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-133: Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations are NOT considered audits for this purpose), and
b.	One of the following:
i.	Forward Pricing Audit (for a Rate or Proposal)
ii.	Post-Award Accounting System Audit
(C)	Potential programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, sub-contracting, etc.).  Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran owned and 8(a) certified businesses. Also address the following considerations:
a.	How many auditors do you have on staff with experience in conducting audits for the federal government?
b.	How many managers with federal audit experience?
c.	Describe specific experience you may have in auditing to various federal audit standards, i.e. GAGAS standards, and
d.	Do you have existing staff to handle several (3-4 audit requests (or more) over the next six-months?  
(D)	Completed Business Declaration Form (attached)

Attached is the draft Performance Work Statement (PWS).  Respondents are encouraged to review the PWS and provide comments.

At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition.

The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request or request for proposal of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense.

NO PHONE CALLS PLEASE.  ALL QUESTIONS MUST BE EMAILED TO THE CONTRACTING OFFICER.

The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following:

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Clinical Center (CC); Office of Purchasing and Contracts (OPC), on behalf of the CC/OPC Office of Clinical Research Training and Medical Education (OCRTME) intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis and award a contract for the administrative support and oversight of graduate medical education programs to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b) (1.)
<p>The NIH Clinical Center is the sponsoring institution at the NIH responsible for the administrative support and oversight of graduate medical education programs designed to train physicians, recruited through a competitive nation-wide search process, in a total of 18 nationally recognized medical/surgical specialties. These graduate medical education programs provide prescribed structured, standardized clinical and research training experiences to these physicians that permits their certification as specialists in a recognized medical or surgical field by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS), a national organization that has established a process for verifying the competence of individual physicians in such recognized medical or surgical specialty fields. However, the prescribed standards and program structure required for the training for physicians in a given medical or surgical specialty field are developed and verified, both for training programs and institutions which sponsor those training programs, through a national process of accreditation established by another organization, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), located in Chicago, Illinois. The ACGME is a private, non-profit organization that accredits approximately 8,700 residency programs in 130 specialties or subspecialties that educate about 109,000 residents nationally. Its mission is to improve health care nationally by assessing and advancing the quality of resident physicians' education through an exemplary accreditation process. <br />Graduate medical education training programs and those institutions that sponsor medical or surgical training programs in a recognized specialty field, such as the NIH Clinical Center, are expected to be accredited by the ACGME in order to permit training program graduates to be certified by the ABMS. It should be noted that those graduate medical education programs and sponsoring institutions that are not accredited by the ACGME are not recognized as providing the required training that permits physicians to be certified as medical or surgical specialists by the ABMS. Thus, physicians who complete specialty training in non-ACGME accredited programs, with rare exception, are not eligible for certification by the ABMS, and are not considered bona fide medical or surgical specialists by health care delivery organizations, medical schools, and academic medical centers throughout the United States. Finally, many states require completion of an ACGME-accredited training program before granting a license to practice medicine and surgery. Thus, accreditation of both individual graduate medical education programs, and the NIH Clinical Center as a sponsor of graduate medical education on the NIH campus, by the ACGME is essential for the NIH Clinical Center and the NIH to meet its mission of training highly competent (i.e., ABMS certified) and qualified physician-scientists and clinician-investigators in the recognized specialty fields of medicine or surgery. <br />The ACGME is a private, non-profit organization that accredits approximately 8,700 residency programs in 130 specialties or subspecialties that educate about 109,000 residents nationally, and no other national accreditation institution satisfy agency requirements. <br />This notice of intent to award is not a request for competitive quotations. Interested concerns capable of providing the same or similar products or services as described in this notice may submit a capability statement outlining their capabilities. No solicitation is available. Information received will be evaluated for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Capability Statements must be received within the time set forth in this synopsis to be considered by the Government. A determination to compete this proposed contract based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>The NCI seeks continuation of services to be acquired through full and open competitive procedures under NAICS 541990. It is anticipated that a cost-reimbursement, completion-type contract with a base period of one year and six one year option periods may be awarded beginning on or about April 1, 2015.</p>
<p>The RFP will be available electronically at a later date and may be accessed through the FedBizOpps at www.fbo.gov. WE ENCOURAGE ALL RESPONSIBLE SOURCES, PARTICULARLY SMALL BUSINESSES, TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL WHICH WILL BE CONSIDERED BY THE AGENCY. This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.

<DESC>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE (NOTICE OF INTENT) SYNOPSIS TO AWARD A CONTRACT WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).
<p><br />THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA), Office of Management on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a non-competitive sole source basis to Children's National Medical Center, 111 Michigan Avenue, NW, Room 1950, Washington, DC 20010 to provide consultation services on a genetic study of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in North America. <br /><br />Background:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) mission has expanded to encompass a broad range of studies aimed at understanding the structure and function of the human genome and its role in health and disease. To that end NHGRI supports the development of resources and technology that will accelerate genome research and its application to human health. A critical part of the NHGRI mission continues to be the study of the ethical, legal and social implications (ELSI) of genome research.</p>
<p>Medical Genetics Branch (MGB) seeks to identify and understand inherited disorders of metabolism and of human development. MGB investigators focus on human genetics, vertebrate embryology, inborn errors of metabolism, and neurogenetic disorders. Projects performed at the biochemical, molecular, and cell biological levels involve the direct study of human subjects as well as the development and use of experimental model systems, such as zebrafish and mouse. The Branch fosters outstanding basic research and serves as a model for translational discoveries at the bedside. Branch researchers develop and test new diagnostic tests and treatments for patients with rare genetic disorders in the NIH Clinical Center. Muenke's research program seeks to improve knowledge about birth defects and normal and abnormal early embryogenesis with special emphasis on the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and reproductive system. Major areas of focus involve holoprosencephaly (HPE), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), craniosynostosis, congenital heart disease (CHD), and sex chromosome anomalies.<br /><br />INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common behavioral disorder of childhood, affecting approximately 5-10 % of children between the ages of 7 and 18 years of age. Up to 40% of children with this condition will continue to have symptoms and impairments during adulthood. It is extensively recognized that patients with ADHD have higher risk for poor education, lower income, increased risk for accidental injuries, and a higher risk of difficulties in social interaction. The impact of this condition on the individual and on society in general has been extensively characterized.</p>
<p>The NIH National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) seek to collaborate and award a provide a purchase order to a highly qualified Child Neurologist from the Department of Neurology at Children's National Medical Center (CNMC) with extensive expertise in clinical and genetic research in ADHD. The Contractor shall provide evaluations of patients and families with diagnosis of ADHD as well as support the collaborative efforts with the MTA study group and any other groups collaborating in NHGRI ADHD research. The Center for Neuroscience and Behavioral Neurology at Children's National Health System (CNMC) is part of the Children's Research Institute. This Center has extensive expertise in clinical care and research in multiple medical conditions, including ADHD. Several studies on ADHD are currently in progress at this Center. A devoted team of neurologists with extensive expertise in multiple areas in neurology and behavioral science are available at this institution. The Department of Neurology at CNMC has an extensive record of cooperation and participation in research studies in multiple areas. It is the largest Child Neurology/pediatric practice in the area, and serves the greater Washington, DC/Maryland/Northern Virginia region through outpatient centers located at the CNMC main campus, as well as through its Regional Outpatient Centers and a number of satellite offices. The proximity to the NIH is very important for this study.</p>
<p>In terms of NHGRI specific research interest, it is widely recognized that ADHD is a genetic condition, with a high rate of association in family members. When the rate of illness in relatives of ADHD probands is compared to the rates of ADHD in controls, it is clear that first and second-degree relatives of ADHD probands are at increased risk for the disorder. A Pediatric Neurologist from the Children National Medical Center with extensive expertise in the clinical management and in research on the mechanisms of ADHD has been fundamental to guarantee that NHRGI clinical evaluations comply with the phenotypic definitions in the study, act as liaison with the MTA study group and support further collaborations that can advance researchers understanding of the biological-genetic mechanisms implicated in ADHD diagnosis and prognosis. A Child Neurologist with expertise in ADHD in clinical and Genetic research is necessary to act as a Medical Director for this study. The National Medical Center has previous knowledge and expertise interacting and collaborating with NIH/National Human Genome Research Institute.<br /><br />WORK SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES:</p>
<p>NHGRI Researchers have interviewed families of children affected with ADHD who have one or more siblings, after obtaining informed consent/assent and determining that their family structure and history make them suitable candidates for a genetic study. It is estimated that for the whole study, 5,000 probands and one or more of their siblings will be interviewed by telephone over several years from different sites in the United States. The research study to date has enrolled 1400 families. To be eligible for the studies, affected individuals must meet the stringent exclusion/inclusion criteria established at an NIH Conference on ADHD in April 1999. To ensure that the ADHD seen in research participants is not part of another syndrome, participants are tested using approved and standardized psychological instruments. During the past years, NHGRI research team has been highly successful in conducting the screening and evaluation of these families. A highly qualified group of health professionals with extensive expertise in ADHD and clinical research has been fundamental in the progress of this study. An extensive clinical interview has been performed, largely via phone interviews, allowing us researchers to include study patients from all 51 United States. The successful study relies on the ability to have a proper clinical diagnosis despite the lack of personal interview for the families. One of the major accomplishments from the on-going study has been the identification of LPHN3, a key gene involved in the etiology of ADHD and comorbid conditions in one of the previously identified regions of strong genetic signal in chromosome 4q13.2.</p>

<SUBJECT>BARDA Chem and RadNuc Animal Model Development
<SOLNBR>RFP-15-100-SOL-00004
<CONTACT>Elizabeth Steiner , Contracting Officer, Phone 202-205-8926, Email Elizabeth.Steiner@hhs.gov
<DESC><p>The development of animal models is a key element in the successful development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) for chemical, radiological, and nuclear (CRN) threats, particularly since efficacy of products directed against most of these threats cannot be verified using clinical studies. In 2002, the FDA amended its regulations for drugs and biologics to permit approval or licensure of MCMs based on substantial evidence of effectiveness in animals when adequate and well-controlled efficacy studies in humans cannot be conducted because it would be unethical to expose healthy human volunteers to lethal or disabling toxic CBRN substances. This change in the regulations (21 CFR 314.600 for drugs and 21 CFR 601.90 for biologics), commonly referred to as the "Animal Rule," made the design and conduct of adequate efficacy studies in appropriate animal models of paramount regulatory importance, since the inference of efficacy in humans necessary for drug approval or licensure is based solely on efficacy data derived in animals. Demonstration of the safety of the medical countermeasure (drug or biologic) is done in normal, healthy adult humans and in some cases safety in a related pathology particularly if the drug or biologic is already approved for the related pathology.</p>
<p>The United States Government (USG) seeks appropriate Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) laboratories that are adequate and available to establish new or existing animal tests and/or models for the development of CRN MCMs. In these models, the challenge dose generally should be the same as that which produces the human disease or condition and the pathophysiological mechanism of its toxicity should be reasonably well-understood and mimic the human disease/condition as closely as possible. When these models are used to test the efficacy of potential MCMs for CRN agents, the mechanism of action of the countermeasure will need to establish the utility of the animal model as a surrogate for humans. BARDA anticipates that contracts awarded from this RFP will serve to facilitate the animal model development of medical countermeasures and/or supportive reagents and assays for regulatory acceptance in the U.S.</p>
<p>HHS, through ASPR and BARDA, anticipates multiple awards of Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts. The anticipated period of performance for any resultant contracts will be for a total of up to 60 months. Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation. Offeror's will be required to respond to Sample Request for Task Order Response (RTOR) documents as part of their proposal.</p>
<p>Mandatory Criteria for Eligibility</p>
<p>Offerors must meet the following mandatory criterion for eligibility for an award: <br /><br />1. Federal, State, and/or local licenses as required for the operation and control of a clinical level irradiation facility with qualified personnel for the operation, assigned safety restrictions, domestic and instrument calibration per licensed Health Physics authority. (Applies to RadNuc Only)</p>
<p>2. Federal, State, and/or local licenses as required for the storage, use, and disposal of select agents such as chemical agents and radionuclides and training of all associated staff responsible for the use of such material. (Applies to both Chem and RadNuc)</p>
<p>3. Association for the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC) accreditation or equivalent. (Applies to both Chem and RadNuc)</p>
<p>4. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) - licensed animal research facility, or equivalent. (Applies to both Chem and RadNuc)</p>
<p>5. GLP Capabilities - List of all GLP studies conducted in the past three years. (Applies to both Chem and RadNuc)</p>
<p>6. BARDA does not intend to award any contracts to offerors that do not have laboratory space within their facilities to conduct small and/or large animal model studies. Subcontracting is an available option, but only to expand capabilities. (Applies to both Chem and RadNuc)</p>
<p>Pre-solicitation Notice Objective</p>
<p>This Pre-solicitation Notice is issued pursuant to FAR Subpart 5.2. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This Pre-solicitation Notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, AMCG is not at this time seeking proposals, and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>It is anticipated that an RFP will be available electronically through the FedBizOpps website on or about January 20, 2015, with proposals being due on or about March 4, 2015. Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government. It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor this internet site (www.fbo.gov) for the release of this solicitation as well as any amendments. Potential offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and any amendments via this website. No collect calls will be accepted. No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. All responses should be identified with the RFP number, name of firm, size standard of the firm, name of requestor, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and email address, and should be submitted to the Point of Contact(s) identified in this notice.</p>
<p>Multiple awards may result from this solicitation with an estimated award date in July 2015.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all respondents must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) https://www.sam.gov and have their records updated in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will be issuing an Invitation for Bid for the Stone Revetment Construction Project at the US Coast Guard Station, located at Point Judith, Narragansett, Rhode Island. The NAICS code for this procurement is 237990.  The estimated construction cost is between $3,000,000 and $6,000,000.  Work is expected to begin in September 2014 and will extend over a 4 to 6 month period.   <br>  <br> The work of this project consists of placement of 4-8 ton stone, underlayer stone, stone bedding and gravel fill filter materials for a 90-foot reach where Hurricane Sandy damaged the seawall and scoured the inclined natural slope behind it.  In addition, placement of 4-8 ton stone protection shall be placed seaward of an additional 400-foot stretch of the seawall.  The USCG Station Point Judith is located at the southern-most end of Ocean Road in Point Judith, Rhode Island, approximately 32 miles south of Providence, RI and approximately 72 miles southwest of Boston, Massachusetts.  The site is bounded by ocean to the south and east, marsh to the west, and a private lot to the north.  The 4-8 ton stone protection in front of the seawall will consist of a10-foot wide berm 14 feet above Mean Low Low Water (MLLW) with a 2 on 1 slope to existing ground.  A 2-foot layer of 1.5 to 2.5-foot diameter underlayer stone will be keyed into the existing ground just underneath the larger armor stone berm.  Approximately 7,000 tons of 4-8 ton stone will be needed to construct the berm in front of 600 LF of seawall, including the damaged reach.  For the 90-foot reach of damaged seawall, placement of 290 CY of underlayer stone, 150 CY of stone bedding, 115 CY of crushed stone, and 200 CY of gravel fill will be required.  An existing basketball court and adjacent USCG land within the property will be provided for access and material storage.  Loose concrete from the damaged seawall must be removed from the site and the basketball court will be replaced.  It is also expected that all work will be performed from land, from above or below the existing seawall.  However, the area in front of the seawall is impacted by high tide cycles (i.e., toe of the proposed berm is below high tide line).  Material deliveries will be limited to daylight hours but material placement will be allowed during a longer time window so that the contractor can work around high tide cycles.   <br>  <br>  <br> This is not a request for proposals at this time.  The solicitation requirements and contract documents to include instructions for submission and the response date will be available on or about June 30, 2014.  Neither telephonic, mailed nor faxed requests for hard copies of this solicitation will be accepted.  The solicitation will only be available online; in order to download the solicitation, offerors must access the Federal Business Opportunities website (www.fbo.gov). All responsible sources may submit a bid which shall be considered by the New England District. Additional questions may be emailed to the Contract Specialist at Doug Raney, Douglas.R.Raney@usace.army.mil <br>

<a href="mailto:brandon.e.mckinnis.civ@mail.mil">ACC - Rock Island (ACC-RI)</a>
<DESC>The Recovered Chemical Materiel (RCM) Directorate, Chemical Material Activity, has the mission responsibility, as mandated by Public Law 102-484, for the disposal of all applicable Department of Defense chemical warfare materiel (CWM) in a safe and environmentally acceptable manner.  In support of this mission, the Government has identified the Transportable Detonation Chamber (TDC) as an alternate technology that will address high quantities of recovered CWM in a manner that will be cost effective, efficient in terms of schedule, and minimizes the generation of hazardous wastes.  This was based on extensive testing and evaluation by the Government of the TDC, dating back to 2002, involving different site locations (Porton Down, England, Schofield Barracks, HI, and Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD) and various chemical fills (phosgene, chloropicrin,  and mustard) and explosive net weights. <br>  <br> Under this sources sought synopsis, it is being planned by the Government to solicit and award a sole source delivery order, in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, under an existing Basic Ordering Agreement W52P1J-10-G-0005 with CH2M Hill for the purchase of its highly specialized TDC system.  The planned follow-on contract action is anticipated to include the following:  the existing TDC system with a spare detonation chamber, technical support, proprietary technical data package and corresponding data rights, and miscellaneous items specific to the TDC System.  As currently being planned, the Government intends to conduct further follow-on testing, evaluation, and development of the purchased TDC at one of its national laboratories. <br>  <br> As described in FAR 6.302 1(a)(2)(iii), the above unique and/or highly specialized supplies and services being planned are available only from the original source; this planned follow-on contract action will be to the current TDC owner, CH2M Hill, Englewood, CO.  The Government has determined that procurement by other than full and open competition is necessary because procurement from any other source than CH2M Hill would result in substantial duplication of incurred testing and evaluation costs (over $20M) to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition and/or would potentially cause unacceptable delays in fulfilling its planned follow-on testing and evaluation (projected in the 2015-2016 timeframe).  This planned follow-on contract will allow RCMD to retain these unique and/or highly specialized supplies and services requirements for its further follow-on testing, evaluation, and development of the TDC without disruption to its mission requirements.  Additionally, this follow-on action may allow the Government to purchase the TDC system including equipment, spare parts, technical data package and corresponding data rights, and technical support, at a discounted price based on the previous use and testing of it. <br>  <br> The proposed contract action is for the TDC system, technical support, the proprietary technical data package and data rights, and miscellaneous items specific to the TDC system for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate, utilizing Alpha contracting techniques with CH2M Hill, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  As such, no written request for proposal will be issued.  Interested persons under this sources sought synopsis may identify their interest and capability to respond to the above requirements.  However, this notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  All submitted information by interested parties that is received within thirty (30) days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The submitted information by interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. <br>  <br> Award of the subject contract is anticipated to be no later than 30 July 2015.   <br>  <br> Email responses shall be submitted to the Contract Specialist, Brandon McKinnis, at Brandon.E.McKinnis.civ@mail.mil <br>

<CONTACT>Elijah N. Gross Jr., Contracting Officer, Phone (202) 377-3014, Email elijah.gross@ed.gov - Richard Segich, Contracting Officer, Email richard.segich@ed.gov
<DESC>A. The Department of Education (DoED), Federal Student Aid (FSA) seeks information from interested and qualified vendors that possess proven capabilities to deliver all or portions of the next generation application (system) hosting services that FSA requires.
<p><br />B. Attachment A provides summary background about DoED and FSA missions and various metrics that depict the magnitude of current virtual data center (VDC) operations. Attachment B provides a summarized listing, by work breakdown structure (WBS), of the range and types of services FSA currently acquires under its VDC contract.</p>
<p>C. Under the aforementioned VDC contract, via a single provider and using a contractor owned, contractor operated (COCO) facility, FSA is provided comprehensive (processing, storage, managed, etc.) data center hosting services. Secondary facilities are used for disaster recovery purposes. This VDC environment consists of a mixture of non-mainframe platforms, about 75% virtualized, running on Windows&reg;, Unix and Linux operating systems; 2-each mainframes and a small number of appliances that are government furnished.</p>
<p>D. FSA envisions that, to the extent feasible, by migrating to cloud environment(s), it would be able to realize significant operational, service delivery and cost improvement benefits. In preparation to replace its VDC contract, several months ago FSA initiated various reviews. One of these reviews included a detailed cloud suitability assessment, which is still in progress, of the 45 primary and 31 subsidiary system applications currently being hosted in the COCO facility.</p>
<p>E. Interim results of this assessment indicate that upwards of 75% of these applications could be migrated to cloud environment(s), ideally using a hosting configuration that includes use of traditional hosting, along with private and public multi-zone (geographically dispersed) cloud hosting. The 25% representing legacy applications, until modernized, were not deemed to currently be suited for cloud hosting, but would continue to use traditional hosting.</p>
<p>F. Of the cloud ready applications, about 25% are candidates for potential use of a public cloud. The other applications would ideally, providing all security criteria can be sufficiently satisfied, be hosted in a private community (multi-government tenant) cloud.</p>
<p>G. As another significant step towards finalizing an acquisition strategy and plan to replace the current VDC contract, FSA seeks to broadly understand the hosting services, especially cloud provider, market place. Accordingly, to the extent applicable, FSA requests interested and qualified suppliers submit sufficiently detailed informational inputs about the following:</p>
<p>1. Provide one or more supplier points of contact, along with an associated phone number(s) and email address(es). Also, assuming use of NAICS 518210 - Data Processing, Hosting, and Related Services, please provide the supplier DUNS number and indicate whether the supplier is an other than small business (OTSB), SB, woman owned SB (WOSB), veteran owned SB (VOSB), service disabled VOSB (SDVOSB) or HUBZONE entity. Lastly, state whether relevant information about the supplier has been entered into the System for Access Management at <a href="http://www.sam.gov">www.sam.gov</a> and if so, if the information is current.</p>
<p>2. Describe the extent and types of proven hosting capabilities the supplier possesses to meet future FSA hosting requirements, stating what range of full or partial proven capabilities the supplier possesses, to provide traditional, public and non-public (community and non-community), single or multi-zone, and combined or separate mainframe data center hosting. If these capabilities include private community hosting, what types of tenants (government, commercial or both) comprise these communities. If multi-zone hosting is included, how many geographic sites are used and how, e.g., to support distributed production work, for disaster recovery or for both types of purposes. If the supplier possesses some of these data center hosting capabilities, but has little or no actual proven experience delivering the services, please clearly state that in your submission. Also, for related managed services, such as the types listed in Attachment B, state whether the supplier provides these services in addition to hosting capabilities or does not provide hosting capabilities, but does offer related managed services, including identify what types of managed services are offered and whether or not these are proven capabilities.</p>
<p>3. &lsquo;Proven' capability means within the past 3 years, the provider has successfully delivered the stated capabilities it possesses. Clearly state whether these capabilities were successfully delivered in a setting similar or greater to, in terms of magnitude and complexity, the FSA application hosting operational environment. Also, provide general background information about and insights into these successful engagements, e.g., work scope, types of hosting environment(s) used or managed services furnished, total contract value of each successful effort, and other information deemed relevant. Identify client type (government or commercial) of each of these efforts and type of data hosting facility, i.e., COCO, government owned and contractor operated (GOCO) or other, involved in delivering the successful work.</p>
<p>4. If the supplier possesses cloud hosting capabilities, state by hosting environment type, whether or not it is currently FEDRAMP certified, or if not, what actions, if any, have been initiated to obtain FEDRAMP certification(s). State whether these environments are currently used or planned to be used by multi-government tenants.</p>
<p>5. State what capabilities the supplier possesses to deliver, beyond hosting platform operating system software, other types of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software products; to manage these software assets, whether government or contractor furnished; and to ensure ongoing compliance with software license agreements. Also, indicate whether these are proven capabilities and the advantages to FSA of using these supplier capabilities.</p>
<p>6. Provide information about other relevant added capabilities the supplier may possess, beyond those summarized in Attachment B or already identified as future available technologies FSA has indicated it is considering migrating towards. As an example, a supplier might possess unique specialized software capabilities that would allow technologically constrained legacy applications, otherwise relegated to use of traditional hosting, to be able to either fully or partially exploit cloud capabilities. For these added capabilities, discuss the degree of market place availability and whether or not these are proven supplier capabilities. <br /><br />7. Provide information about government contract arrangements, the supplier already has been awarded, e.g., GSA schedule(s) or government-wide acquisition contract(s), that FSA could potentially partially or fully use to fulfill its requirement.</p>
<p>8. Regarding multi-zone cloud hosting, as applicable, please discuss the key attributes to consider when using this type of hosting and lessons learned from these experiences.</p>
<p>9. Provide details about any recent relevant experience the supplier has had with executing incoming or outgoing transitions or migrations from one hosting environment to new or different hosting environments. Generally discuss the nature of these experiences, highlighting what went well, what were key challenges and primary lessons learned.</p>
<p>10. Currently, FSA utilizes activity based costing and is interested in the capabilities to obtain more granular and transparent data about the hosting infrastructure and utilization metrics. Also, FSA seeks to understand the common pricing models used by industry in delivering different types of hosting and related managed services. Please provide general input on this and concurrently discuss the key factors that should be considered in using different types of pricing models and related lessons learned.</p>
<p>11. Drawing on supplier experiences, along with industry best practices and common standards, provide general input about the most relevant service level agreements (SLAs) and how the use of different hosting environments impacts and presents different challenges relative to roles and responsibilities (RACI). Also, provide input on what types of SLAs and RACIs the supplier deems most important for each type of hosting environment and why? If the supplier has had both experience with application-centric and infrastructure-centric SLAs and RACIs, please contrast key differences between these two types of SLAs and RACIs, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>
<p>12. Provide input on the key attributes the vendor believes are important to consider when selecting source(s) to fill future FSA hosting requirements. Provide the supplier rationale for why it sees these as being key or critical source selection attributes to consider.</p>
<p>13. Provide any other related input the supplier feels is relevant that FSA has not specifically requested input on but the supplier believes FSA should take into consideration as part of finalizing its acquisition strategy to acquire future hosting services to replace the current VDC contract.</p>
<p>H. As indicated, FSA intends to use the inputs received in response to the RFI to finalize a related acquisition strategy and plan.

<SUBJECT>B--Notice of Intent to Sole Source
<SOLNBR>R15PS00168
<CONTACT>Adams, Kelli R
<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) intends to award a modification on a sole source basis to Sound Science LLC, 712 Eastridge Pl., Boise, ID 83712-7503 for landscape level scientific, technical and advisory services to increase the current contract value. The proposed contractor possesses the following unique qualifications which are required for this acquisition: program knowledge, expertise and confidentiality.  Sound Science is currently peer reviewing several program documents and has gained an immense amount of expertise and a magnitude of knowledge about the program requirements.  Work under this modification relates directly to contract no. R13PC30272 and it has been determined that additional effort and technical services are necessary.  Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 which authorizes other than full and open competition when the supplies or services required by the agency area are available from only one responsible source and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirements.

A Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition has been prepared in support of this acquisition.

This notice of intent is being provided for informational purposes only; this is not a request for competitive proposals, quote or an invitation for bids.  In accordance with FAR subpart 5.207 (c) (15) (ii), all responsible sources may provide a capabilities statement for consideration by Reclamation no later than December 15, 2014 at 4:30 PM PST.  Any cost associated with the preparation and submission of data or information or any other costs incurred in responding to this notice is the sole responsibility of the respondent and will not be reimbursed by the Government.  A determination not to compete this proposed requirement upon receipt of any response to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

Questions may be directed to Kelli Adams at (702) 293-8363, or via email at kadams@usbr.gov

<DESC>When purchased from Morris Systems Inc., the servers comes complete with the necessary software upgrades and hardware-specific device drivers and modules included in the quoted price.&nbsp; If the server is purchased from an alternate vendor, Morris Systems Inc. charges a substantial fee to equip the server with the OS upgrades, drivers, and perform the M-Systems sofware installationonfiguration and data transfer from the old server to the new unit, ultimately making it more costly to acquire a new fully functional server.&nbsp; Since Morris Systems Inc. is the only vendor that can install and configure its own copyrighted software programs, it can best provide the specific hardware for the software to run on for optional performance.

<DESC>The Government is issuing this RFI/sources sought announcement as part of market research for multispectral beacons and signaling operations. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division located at Naval Support Activity, Crane, IN is seeking information from companies with the capabilities and facilities to provide multispectral beacons and signaling capabilities.
<p>The Government is seeking multispectral beacons in the following wavelength bands: Near Infra-Red (NIR), Short Wave IR (SWIR), Mid Wave IR (MWIR), and Long Wave IR (LWIR). Other features will be considered such as selectable spectrums, programmable blink rates, remote activation, data communication, and environmental sealing. The Government is seeking multispectral beacons that operate in a maritime environment and are powered from an 18-32 Volt DC unregulated source or a self-contained battery source. Current beacon systems, if equipped in the respective wavelength band, provide near omni-directional emission with the following approximate optical intensities: NIR - 750 mW/sr; SWIR - 130 mW/sr; MWIR - 230 mW/sr; and LWIR - 45 mW/sr.</p>
<p>The Government is aware that the detection ranges of these beacons depend upon many factors; however, range performance estimates shall assume detection systems utilizing high performance sensors. These sensors include stabilized gimbaled camera systems (with instantaneous Field of View (iFOV) of 30 &micro;rad or less), night vision goggles, and handheld imagers. The detection systems shall approximate atmospheric loss calculations in varied environments, with varied ambient environments. The ranges should fall into the following areas: 0 to 500 meters will be short range, 0.5 to 5 kilometers will be medium range, and 5 kilometers and above will be long range. The Government will place special emphasis on long range detection.</p>
<p>All interested parties are encouraged to submit company and product literature, a white paper no longer than 5 pages, and/or other pertinent information, such as descriptions of use in similar applications, drawings, brochures, videos, summary of prior testing, a budgetary estimate of test articles and production units by 4:00 PM EST on 5 Jan 2015.</p>
<p>Responses to the Market Survey shall include the following:</p>
<p>Submitter's Name<br />Street Address, City, State, Zip Code<br />Business Size<br />Point of Contact (POC)<br />POC Telephone<br />Announcement Number: N00164-15-S-NB09</p>
<p>Contractors must be properly registered in the Government System for Award Management database (SAM). Contractors may obtain information on SAM registration and annual confirmation of requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the internet at www.sam.gov.</p>

<p><br />1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future. This request for information does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Further, the Navy is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals. Respondees are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the interested party's expense. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future RFP, if any is issued. If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website. It is the responsibility of the potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information pertaining to this requirement.</p>
<p>2.0 Background</p>

None of the attached Drawing Packages/Performance Specifications will be Classified for this request. It's the Government's preference that all respondees be able to provide supplies in all FSC's, however, this may not be a realistic expectation.</p>
<p>Ideally, the Government would like to find multiple contractors who can provide all of the items listed in the attachment. If a solicitation is issued at a later date, the Government's preference would be to compete each requirement among the awardees and issue job orders/delivery orders based on pre-established evaluation criteria.</p>

<DESC>The Mobile District, US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) intends to negotiate on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) quote. <br> Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements for the annual inspection and repair of the SeaTrax series 72 7200-DR type crane Choctawhatchee. The USACE Mobile intends to request a quote from Seatrax Inc. 13223 <br> Fm 529  Houston, TX 77041-2532. <br>  <br>  <br> The inspection and repair will likely be completed 30 days after award, and all work is to be performed at Coffeeville Lock and Dam, 697 Coffeeville Lock and Dam Road, Silas, Alabama <br> 36919-5566. Product Service Code is 1935, NAICS Code is 333120, and size standard is 750 employees. <br>  <br>  <br> The sole source determination based on SeaTrax Inc. being the manufacturer of the crane and is the only group that can perform certain repairs and component replacement. They have the technical expertise, the necessary technical information and the proprietary knowledge to certify the work in accordance with EM385-1-1. The cost of another company completing this task would likely double the anticipated price from a vendor without the knowledge already accrued from SeaTrax Inc. and thus without resulting in substantial duplication of costs to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition. <br>  <br>  <br> This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals. Parties may express their interest, accompanied by supporting literature, to the Contracting Officer no later than December <br> 22, 2014. Responses should be sent to jeffery.j.mason@usace.army.mil. Telephone responses will not be accepted. Information received will be for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct a competitive procurement. The determination to conduct a competitive procurement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. <br>  <br>  <br> USACE Contracting Office: <br> 109 St. Joseph Street <br> Mobile, AL 36602 <br>  <br> Jeff J.

<DESC>Notice of Intent to Sole Source:
The Department of Veterans SAO West NCO 19, Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center, 4100 E. Mississippi Avenue Suite 900, Glendale, CO 80246 intends to enter into sole source procurement authorized/required by statute FAR6.302-5, for contracts for orthopedic and prosthetic appliances citing 38 U.S.C. 8123, with HOWMEDICA OSTEONICS CORP. (doing business as Stryker Orthopedics) at 325 Corporate Dive, Mahwah, NJ 07430 for the procurement of a complete Gamma 3 Distal Targeting-Nailing Kit with T2 surgical implant screws. The anticipated requirement will be a complete surgical implant kit for the Denver VA Medical Centers OR Trauma Surgeons.
HOWMEDICA OSTEONICS CORP has been found to be the only source available to provide this surgical equipment to the Denver VA Medical Center located at 1055 Clermont Street in Denver, Colorado. No other vendor was able to provide the requested items. A physician's decision to use a particular manufacturer's orthopedic implants or orthobiological products is based on physician preference/expertise. The use of particular implants and orthobiological products requires highly specialized training. Use of equipment a surgeon is familiar and comfortable with can directly impact the outcome of patient surgeries. Additional instrumentation sets such as drills and placement equipment are essential to proper surgical implant procedures. Equipment is proprietary and designed for use on specific surgical implants. The instrumentation sets must be readily available for emergency surgeries that require these specific surgical implants. Stryker provides on-site representatives to assist and oversee proper use of their equipment. This presence of trained technical experts is vital to ensuring that the patient is being given the highest quality and necessary treatment.
The associated NAICS Code is 339112. This is a Notice of Intent and is not a request for competitive proposals.
This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document shall be posted and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any manufacturer that determines it can meet the requirements may give written notice via e-mail to kurt.tanny@va.gov prior to 12-10-2014 at 12:00 PM Mountain Time.
Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail to demonstrate the ability to meet the subject requirement. This information shall be provided at no cost or obligation to the Government. All responses received will be evaluated; however, the information received will be used solely for the purposes of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement at the sole discretion of the Contracting Officer.
If no responses are received, the Denver VA SAO West NCO 19 Rocky Mountain Acquisition Center will proceed with sole source procurement to HOWMEDICA OSTEONICS CORP. directly.

<p>iii. Volume Three (Do not exceed ten (10) pages). <br />A. Contracting Information. <br />(1) Provide the signature block of the individual authorized to make an offer which includes individual's name, title, e-mail address and phone number.<br />(2) Provide cage code, data universal numbering system (DUNS) number, and tax identification number as registered in the System for Award Management (SAM). <br />(3) Organizational Representatives.

Enter pricing only on the Government Schedule B. Offeror shall NOT alter the Schedule B in any way with the exception of entering pricing.

Schedule B unit prices shall be limited to two decimal places. <br />b. Identify a CLIN/SLIN (Contract Line Item/Sub Line Item) as Not Separately Priced by entering "NSP" in the unit price. Identify a CLIN/SLIN as No Charge by entering "NC" in the unit price.<br />c.

Therefore, the offeror/awardee may not propose for any taxes from which the Federal Government is exempt. In reference to CLIN 0004 - "Taxes, Fees and Surcharges" (TFS), Offeror(s) must submit the supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, FCC rulings and rates, or other documentation justifying all applicable and allowable TFS. Enter only the amount that is documented as applicable and allowable. Inclusion of any amount that is not documented may render the proposal being rejected. Provide a separate delineation or breakdown of all applicable TFS.<br />(3) Provide a statement specifying that "all pricing in the proposal is Firm-Fixed, with the exception of TFS".</p>
<p>(c) Period of Acceptance of Offers. The Offeror agrees to hold the prices in its offer firm for 120 days from the date specified for receipt of offers.</p>
<p>(e) Multiple offers. If more than one solution to the services is available, Offeror may submit multiple offers for consideration, subject to same page limitations. Multiple offers may not be considered if they alter the Government's requirement. Should the Offeror claim exceptions to any requirement in the solicitation, these exceptions shall be listed and rationale provided. Failure to include exceptions will be deemed as acceptance of all terms and conditions of the solicitation and resulting contract.</p>
<p>(h) Multiple awards. This award shall be made on an all or none basis.<br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-1)</p>
<p>(ix) Provision 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition along with the following addenda to the provision.<br />52.212-2 Addendum:<br />Evaluation Criteria. The basis for award will be use of best value in which competing Offerors' past performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to cost or price considerations. By submission of an offer, the Offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, representations and certifications, and technical requirements, in addition to those identified as evaluation factors. All Offerors shall be evaluated for technical acceptability. Failure to meet a requirement may result in an offer being determined technically unacceptable. Moreover, the government reserves the right to award a CSA for services from an incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) or other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation if it is in the best interest of the Government, price and other factors considered, as discussed herein, even if the company has not submitted an offer. Award will be made to the responsible Offeror proposing the combination most advantageous to the Government based upon an integrated assessment of the evaluation factors described below. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:<br />(a) FACTOR 1 - TECHNICAL. The Government technical evaluation team will evaluate the technical proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of acceptable or unacceptable. Only those offers determined to be technically acceptable, either initially or as a result of discussions, will be considered for an award. The offers shall be evaluated against the following technical subfactors:<br /><br />Subfactor 1 - Provider Capability <br />This subfactor is met when the Offeror provides evidence they are a telecommunications company having the capability to provide Basic Rate Interfaces (BRI), Commercial Subscriber Lines (CSL), and number portability. Provide documented evidence of all interconnection agreements and/or leasing arrangements relevant to this effort.</p>
<p>(b) FACTOR 2 -- PRICE. All CLINs/SLINs within the Schedule B will be evaluated for award multiplying the estimated quantity times the unit price in the Schedule B and subtracting any applicable considered discount(s) to derive the total evaluated price. The price evaluation will document the reasonableness and affordability of the proposed total evaluated price. The Government reserves the right to compare offered prices with tariff prices of an incumbent LEC or with any other LEC with a universal service obligation for the services required in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) FACTOR 3 -- PAST PERFORMANCE. In evaluating PPI, the government will employ several approaches including: reviewing contract references provided by the offeror; seeking PPI through the use of questionnaires; as well as using data independently obtained from other Government and commercial sources. Only recent (within the last three years) and relevant PPI (similar or greater in scope, magnitude of effort, and complexity than effort described in this solicitation) will be evaluated. When reviewing PPI, judgment will be used in assessing the probability of success, problems on previous efforts, and the alternatives available to meet the requirements. The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment rating of the Offeror's ability to satisfactorily perform the services described in this solicitation. The performance confidence assessment will result in an overall performance confidence rating identified with corresponding definition as follows: <br />(A) Substantial Confidence - Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a high expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort.<br />(B)Satisfactory Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has an expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(C) Limited Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has a low expectation that the Offeror will successfully perform the required effort. <br />(D) No Confidence -Based on the Offeror's performance record, the Government has no expectation that the Offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort. <br />(E) Unknown Confidence -No performance record is identifiable, or the Offeror's performance record is so limited that no confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned. In the case of an Offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available, the Offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (reference FAR 15.3 (a)(2)(iv)).<br />The Government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if the lowest priced Offeror is judged to have a performance confidence assessment of "Satisfactory Confidence" or lower. If the lowest priced, technically acceptable offer is deemed to have a "Substantial Confidence" performance assessment, the Contracting Officer may determine it to represent the best value to the Government. If so, award shall be made to that offeror without discussions or further consideration of any other offer. <br />(End of Addendum to Provision 52.212-2)</p>
<p>(x) Complete all representations and certifications electronically at the following website: https://sam.gov/. If not completed on-line, Offerors must include a completed copy of the provisions at FAR 52.212-3, which can be obtained at http://farsite.hill.af.mil, FAR Part 52 or online at https://sam.gov/. In addition, complete the following Addendum I to 52.212-3:<br /><br />52.212-3 Addendum, Certification to Accept the Government Purchase Card (GPC). If the Government's intent for payment is via the GPC IAW clauses 52.232-36 and 52.212-4, Addendum, paragraph (i) (3), the Offeror must certify that it:<br />( ) (i) will accept the GPC for payments under this contract.<br />( ) (ii) will not accept the GPC for payments under this contract.</p>

These requirements also apply to applications pending on the effective date of this contract.<br />(3) Public Utilities Commission (PUC) Authorization. All Offerors shall be local exchange carriers certificated (Service Provider Certificate of Operating Authority (SPCOA) , or Certificate of Operating Authority (COA)) with the state PUC where services are being provided. This contract shall at all times be subject to such changes by the PUC of the state having jurisdiction over the particular site as said Commission may, from time to time, direct in the exercise of its jurisdiction.<br />(4) Rates, Charges, and Services. <br />(i) The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under this contract in accordance with-<br />(A) All applicable tariffs, rules, regulations, or requirements;<br />(1) Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and<br />(2) Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;<br />(B) A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor's cost experience including tariff changes with the exception of TFS. If the prices differ from established tariff prices, it is the responsibility of the contractor to either file a special tariff for the contract with the relevant Governmental authorities or make other arrangements to comply with the governmental requirements. The Air Force will not be liable for price increases for failure to follow these requirements. If, during the term of the contract, the TFS change, the contractor must submit supporting state statutes, local ordinances, regulations, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling and rates, etc, for Government verification.

If the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition shall be competitive, if practicable.<br />(vii) If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified shall be equitably adjusted at the time of deferral or change.

In all respects, the requirements of this clause shall apply to the assignee as if it were the Contractor.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(ii) Examples.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

<p>As prescribed in 37.110(b), insert the following clause in solicitations and contracts for services to be performed on Government installations, unless a construction contract is contemplated:</p>
<p>Protection of Government Buildings, Equipment, and Vegetation (Apr 1984)</p>
<p>The Contractor shall use reasonable care to avoid damaging existing buildings, equipment, and vegetation on the Government installation. If the Contractor's failure to use reasonable care causes damage to any of this property, the Contractor shall replace or repair the damage at no expense to the Government as the Contracting Officer directs. If the Contractor fails or refuses to make such repair or replacement, the Contractor shall be liable for the cost, which may be deducted from the contract price.</p>
<p>AGAR 452.237-74 Key Personnel (FEB 1988) <br />(a) The Contractor shall assign to this contract the following key personnel: <br />&bull; List Position Title(s)<br />&bull; <br />(b) During the first ninety (90) days of performance, the Contractor shall make no substitutions of key personnel unless the substitution is necessitated by illness, death, or termination of employment. The Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days after the occurrence of any of these events and provide the information required by paragraph (c) below. After the initial 90-day period, the Contractor shall submit the information required by paragraph (c) to the Contracting Officer at least 15 days prior to making any permanent substitutions. <br />(c) The Contractor shall provide a detailed explanation of the circumstances necessitating the proposed substitutions, complete resumes for the proposed substitutes, and any additional information requested by the Contracting Officer. Proposed substitutes should have comparable qualifications to those of the persons being replaced. The Contracting Officer will notify the Contractor within 15 calendar days after receipt of all required information of the decision on substitutions. The contract will be modified to reflect any approved changes of key personnel.<br />4G52.222-701 EMPLOYMENT OF ELIGIBLE WORKERS (DECEMBER 1999)</p>
<p>Section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 USC 1324a) makes it unlawful for an employer to hire unauthorized aliens. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), now the United States Citizen and Immigration Services, established the Form I-9, Employment Eligibility Verification Form, as the document to be used for employment eligibility verification (8 CFR 274a).</p>
<p>The contractor is required to:<br />1. Have all employees complete and sign the I-9 Form to certify that they are eligible for employment; <br />2. Examine documents presented by the employee and ensure the documents appear to be genuine and related to the individual;<br />3. Record information about the documents on the form, and complete the certification portion of the form; <br />4. Retain the form for 3 years, or 1 year past the end of employment of the individual, whichever is longer.</p>
<p>It is illegal to discriminate against any individual (other than a citizen of another country who is not authorized to work in the United States) in hiring, discharging, or recruiting because of that individual's national origin or citizenship status.</p>
<p>Compliance with Section 274A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1324a) is a material condition of the contract. If the contractor employs unauthorized workers during contract performance in violation of section 274A, the Government may terminate the contract, in addition to other remedies or penalties prescribed by law.</p>
<p>For further information on the requirements of the Act, contractors should contact the Employer and Labor Relations Officer of their local United States Citizen and Immigration Services office.</p>
<p>AGAR 452.209 - 71 ASSURANCE REGARDING FELONY CONVICTION OR TAX DELINQUENT STATUS FOR CORPORATE APPLICANTS, ALTERNATE 1 (FEB 2012)<br />(a) This award is subject to the provisions contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (P.L. No. 112-74), Division E, Sections 433 and 434 regarding corporate felony convictions and corporate federal tax delinquencies. Accordingly, by accepting this award the contractor acknowledges that it -</p>
<p>(1) does not have a tax delinquency, meaning that it is not subject to any unpaid Federal tax liability that has been assessed, for which all judicial and administrative remedies have been exhausted or have lapsed, and that is not being paid in a timely manner pursuant to an agreement with the authority responsible for collecting the tax liability, and</p>
<p>(2) has not been convicted (or had an officer or agent acting on its behalf convicted) of a felony criminal violation under any Federal law within 24 months preceding the award, unless a suspending and debarring official of the United States Department of Agriculture has considered suspension or debarment of the awardee, or such officer or agent, based on these convictions and/or tax delinquencies and determined that suspension or debarment is not necessary to protect the interests of the Government.</p>
<p>(b) If the awardee fails to comply with these provisions, the Forest Service may terminate this contract for default and may recover any funds the awardee has received in violation of sections 433 or 434.</p>

The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals-<br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency;<br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property;<br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6 and part 13, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation number HSCG38-15-Q-200033 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-78 effective 25 November 2014.

The applicable North American Industry Classification Standard Code is 336411.  The small business size standard is 1,500 employees. This is an unrestricted requirement. All responsible sources may submit a quotation which shall be considered by the agency.  

It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price purchase order shall be awarded on a sole source basis to Airbus Helicopter Incorporated (AHI) as a result of this synopsis/solicitation. All parts must have clear traceability to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)s, Airbus Helicopter France (Cage Code F0210), Teleflex Syneravia SA (Cage Code F0280), and Zodiac Aero Electric (Cage Code F0214). Traceability means a clear, complete, documented, and auditable paper trail which traces each step from an OEM or distributor to its current location.

It is the Government's belief that AHI is the only known source to provide traceability, and genuine OEM parts, required to successfully provide these items.  Concerns having the expertise and required capabilities to provide these items are invited to submit offers in accordance with the requirements stipulated in this solicitation. No alternate part numbers will be accepted.  

SEE ATTACHED SPREADSHEET HSCG38-15-Q-200033 - REQUIREMENTS FOR A LIST OF REQUIRED PARTS.

Parts must be approved in accordance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines to ensure safety of our aircrew.  Best Value to the Government is always the goal, but without jeopardizing quality or safety of flight.  Only the use of airworthy commercial specifications or stand military specifications/military standard parts will be utilized and approved from this solicitation.  
Newly manufactured commercial items will only be procured from sources able to provide a certificate of airworthiness, FAA 8130 (preferred) or equivalent European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Certification, a Certificate of Conformance and traceability to the OEM.  The Federal Aviation Regulation, Part 21, outlines certification procedures.  

The contractor shall furnish a COC in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) clause 52.246-15. COC must be submitted in the format specified in the clause.  All replacement parts shall be NEW approved parts.

NO SUBSTITUTE OR ALTERNATE PARTS WILL BE CONSIDERED.  ONLY NEW PARTS WILL BE ACCEPTED. 

Consistent with FAR Provision 52.212-1(h), the Government reserves the right to make more than one award (multiple awards) for different line items, if, after considering the additional administrative cost to the Government of awarding and administering separate purchase orders, it is determined that the multiple awards will result in the best value to the Government.  For purposes of evaluating the cost of making multiple awards, it is assumed that the administrative cost of awarding and administering a purchase order is $500.

NOTE: NO DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS OR SCHEMATICS ARE AVAILABLE FROM THIS AGENCY.

SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENT TITLED TERMS AND CONDITIONS  HSCG38-15-Q-200033 FOR APPLICABLE CLAUSES, INSTRUCTIONS AND EVALUTION CRITERIA.  

Closing date and time for receipt of offers is 11 December 2014 at 11:15 am EST.   Anticipated award date is on or about 11 December 2014.  E-mail quotations are preferred and may be sent to Isaac.L.Brothers@uscg.mil .  Please indicate HSCG38-15-Q-200033 in subject line.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

Ombudsman Notice

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<DESC>Amendment 000002 Dissolves Small Business Set-Aside Requirements and Extends Quote Due Date to 12/14/2014.

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This Solicitation Notice is to announce the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for the 2-D seismic reflection data from the area of interest in accordance with the attached solicitation. The solicitation number is G15PS00024 and is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The policies contained in FAR Part 13, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award. This is a 100% Small Business Set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 519190 Other Information Services (Small Business Size Standard $27.5 M). A copy of this solicitation may be accessed at FedConnect, www.fedconnect.net. All requirements for preparation, submission, and receipt of offers contained in the solicitation shall be adhered to.

The Department of Interior (DOI) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) The Crustal Geophysics and Geochemistry Science Center, in collaboration with the Central Mineral and Environmental Resources and Eastern Energy and Mineral Resources Science Centers, Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, CO, USA conducts geologic investigations into the geologic framework and mineral resource potential in a region known as the Mid-continent Rift. The project is supported by the Mineral Resources Program, within the Energy and Mineral Resources Mission Area. The project area covers the midwestern states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa. Because most of the Mid-continent rift is covered by younger formations, the investigation relies heavily on subsurface information that is supplied through the use of a variety of geophysical methods and well log data. These data sources are used to determine geologic structure, stratigraphic relationships, tectonics, and geologic history as it relates to understanding the distribution of mineralization throughout the region. To this end, the USGS currently requires seismic data brokers to furnish and deliver two dimensional (2-D) multichannel seismic reflection data from an area in northern Wisconsin, where available geophysical and geologic information fall short in understanding critical questions about a scientifically important part of the Mid-continent rift.

The awarded contractor shall provide existing 2-D seismic reflection data from the area.  The data must have been acquired from and processed using the minimum standards and specifications described in the Specifications.
Evaluation - Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible seller whose bid conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other non-price factors considered. Offers submitted in response to this solicitation will be evaluated based upon the following non-price or non-cost factors, of which Factor (B) will be of most importance:

Factor (A) Past Performance: offerors shall submit not less than two references for services performed during the past three years. Each reference shall include: the company or agency name, address, contract or order number, point(s) of contract phone number and email address(es);

Factor (B) Quality of Data: All offerors must provide maps (hardcopy, jpg, or tiff) depicting the locations of available seismic data from within the area.

The USGS select lines of interest and request to view paper copies of the final processed data and make a final decision on which digital data to purchase. The digital data shall be of such quality as to allow the USGS interpreters the ability to distinguish key geologic features. Data must be of sufficient resolution to allow interpretation of subsurface structures (e.g., faults and folds, stratigraphic features such as sequence stratigraphic units, incised valley, unconformities, and pinch-outs; and diapiric structures caused by salt or mud flow). If the quality of the processed data are not of sufficient quality to allow for the interpretation of subsurface structures (e.g., faults and folds, stratigraphic features such as sequence stratigraphic units, incised valley, unconformities, and pinch-outs; and diapiric structures caused by salt or mud flow), the USGS will request access to the raw unprocessed field data in order to re-process the data with better results. The contractor offering seismic data with the highest CMP fold will be of greater technical merit.

Award shall be made to the vendor whose quotation, conforming to this solicitation, is determined to be the most advantages to the government, cost or price and the other non-cost or non-price factors listed. In determining which quotation offers the greatest value or advantage to the Government, overall technical merit will be considered more important than price or cost. The degree of importance of price or cost as an evaluation factor will increase with the degree of equality in the technical merits of the quotations. Between acceptable quotations with a significant difference in technical merit, a determination will be made as to whether the additional technical merit or benefits reflected by a higher priced quotation warrants payment of the additional price or cost.
The Contracting Officer is the only person who can legally obligate the Government for the expenditure of public funds. Costs shall not be incurred by recipients of this solicitation in anticipation of receiving direct reimbursement from the Government. It is understood that your offer will become part of the official file on this matter without obligation to the Government.

Electronic Transmission of Offers. Offers may only be transmitted via FedConnect, www.fedconnect.net, or via email to Don Downey, ddowney@usgs.gov . Offers shall consist of two volumes: Volume One shall be non-price (technical) evaluation support documentation, Volume Two shall be Price Quotes.

Questions/Inquiries shall be sent electronically to Don Downey, ddowney@usgs.gov. Questions received within the last five (5) days before this solicitation closes/ends will be considered untimely and may not receive a response.
This solicitation closes/ends 12/14/2014 at 1700 ET. All offers shall be received in their entirety by 12/14/2014 at 1700 ET.

If it is determined that a small business set-aside is appropriate and your company anticipates submitting a proposal as the prime contractor for a small business set-aside, please provide specific details and rationale as to how compliance with FAR clause 52.219-14 would be achieved, including specific details regarding teaming arrangements, etc. If subcontracts are to be used, provide anticipated percentage of effort to be subcontracted and whether small or large businesses will be used. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming must be provided.<br /><br />If this effort is not set-aside for small business, small business utilization will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable expectation for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.</p>

Once the solicitation is posted, it is the responsibility of interested parties to review this site frequently for any updates/amendments to any and all documents. This notice allows for potential offerors to judge whether or how they can satisfy the Government's requirement and increase the efficiency in their proposal preparation. <strong>This notice of intent does not in itself represent the issuing of a formal request for proposal and is not intended to be taken as such. No proposals will be accepted.<br /><br /></strong>The purpose of this effort will be to provide Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) tasks required to support the AFNWC/NCL mission of Technical Order (TO) Support and Logistics Management. This will require supporting aircraft nuclear weapon loading, warhead mate/de-mate, delivery, transport, storage (in-ground vaults), integrated security system (WS3) and a mobile maintenance platform for the United States Air Force (USAF), North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and non-U.S. NATO nuclear-capable systems in technical editing, distribution and support of both classified and unclassified TOs in accordance with applicable Air Force Instructions using ADOBE Frame Maker and other associated publication/graphic software. The offeror will assist the government as the POC for nuclear Technical Order Distribution Offices (TODO) training initiatives and assist the AFNWC TO management team with other nuclear TO management efforts. The offeror will disseminate system policy and procedures. The offeror will track and assist with management of the TO change request process, assist with TO account management, packaging and distribution of classified and unclassified AF TOs and Joint Nuclear Weapons Publication System (JNWPS) publications IAW applicable instructions. They will be required to use current management system software to manage TO accounts and use the TO account management system when implemented. The offeror will convert any and all paper or digital TOs to usable electronic format (for example, PDF, S-1000D, HTML, SGML, XML, etc.) and perform related duties involving TOs and flight manual support. All Foreign Military Sales (FMS) support hours will be tracked separately for each case. The offeror will provide support for stockpile management, second destination transportation, weapon/component moves, tracking of automated reports and data input into various systems, and maintain those systems. Access to a classified DTRA database and classified information will be required at the Secret Level. All work must be integrated with government civilians within AFNWC/NCL and will only be done in AFNWC facilities at Kirtland AFB, NM, expect during temporary duty support. The offeror is responsible for training contractor employees in current publication software on offeror time. The offeror will support TDYs for conferences or other support activities in wither CONUS or OCONUS per government direction. All personnel must have, and be able to maintain a minimum of a Top Secret Security Clearance.<br /><br />This requirement will be solicited for full and open competition. The solicitation will be issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP), which is expected to result in a single contract with FFP and CPFF CLINs. The contract will have a Base Year of 12 months, with 4 Option Years, each lasting 12 months. The period of performance for this requirement is 16 March 2015 - 15 March 2020. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code for this procurement is 541990, with a small business size standard of&nbsp;$15,000,000.00. <br /><br /><strong>Foreign participation is not permitted on this requirement. <br /></strong><br />Technology developed under the subject program may be subject to U.S. export-control laws and regulations. These laws restrict the transfer, by any means, of certain types of items, information and technology to unauthorized persons. The award of a government contract does not negate the contractor's responsibility to comply with export control requirements under the Arms Export Control Act (Department of State) or the Export Administration Regulations (Department of Commerce). Potential security risks/export violations may occur when contractors employ foreign nationals or outsource portions of the contract's statement of work. The transfer of sensitive or critical unclassified technology to a foreign national without an approved export license is a violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the Export Administration Act.<br /><br />All prospective contractors must be registered in System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for contract award. Registration may take several weeks to complete, so immediate attention to ensure eligibility is recommended. For registration, go to http://www.sam.gov and follow the instructions.<br />

<DESC>This Sources Sought Synopsis is issued for maximizing competition.  Should anything in the requirement be construed as limiting competition, please feel free to contact the MICC Special Competition Advocate (SCA) at dean.m.carsello.civ@mail.mil.  <br>  This is a re-compete for a previously competed Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) for transportation services.  The requirement is for non-personal services, performance-based acquisition to provide transportation services, of family members of U.S. Army Soldiers returning from overseas that have been classified as deceased, injured, ill, or wounded, in and around the National Capital Region (NCR). Transportation is required for these Family Members when their presence is requested by an authorized official to attend a U.S. Government supported ceremonial event, and/or when Family Members have been called to the bedside of a Soldier by an authorized official. Ceremonial events may include but are not limited to funeral and memorial services and military honor and recognition functions.  The bedside of the Soldier is defined as the location where a Soldier is receiving medical treatment. The proponent agency is the U.S. Army Human Resource Command's Casualty and Mortuary Affairs Operations Center (CMAOC), located at Dover Air Force Base, Maryland. Base period of performance: 1 September 2015 through 30 August 2016, with four one-year option periods.  <br>    <br>  The contractor shall provide all personnel, equipment, supplies, facilities, transportation, tools, materials, supervision, and other items and non-personal services necessary to perform transportation services. Each dispatched vehicle shall be capable of carrying not less than 4 passengers and 6 bags, and each dispatched vehicle shall not require refueling upon pickup, during transit, or during return to destination.  In some cases the dispatched vehicle may need to be handicap accessible upon request.  More than one vehicle may be required for a single service call, based on the number of Family Members that need transportation and the requirement for up to 2 designated WTB escorts to be in the vehicle/s with the Family Members. The contactor will conduct logistical coordination with proponent agency POCs, and is responsible successful task execution.  <br>    <br>  The appropriate NAICS code is 485320 with a size standard of $15,000,000.00.  <br>    <br>  This synopsis is not a request for proposal. It is a market research tool being used to determine procurement strategy.  Appropriate procurement strategy will be determined after consideration of industry response to this sources sought synopsis. The government is not obligated to, and will not, pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  <br>    <br>  NOTE: For any acquisition set-aside for small business, Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, will apply and will require the prime contractor to self-perform at least 50 percent of the labor with its own employees. Prime contractors cannot sub-contract the entire effort.  Again, this applies only to small business set-asides.  <br>    <br>  Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 1:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time on Thursday, 11 December 2014.  Responses should be emailed to raymond.s.gaddie.civ@mail.mil.  Responses shall include the following:  <br>    <br>  1. Company name and address;  <br>    <br>  2. A statement of interest that meets all the requirements listed above;  <br>    <br>  3. A synopsis of the contractor's capabilities;  <br>    <br>  4. Company size: small or large, new qualified small business sources, including veteran-owned small, service-disabled veteran-owned small, HUBZone small, small disadvantaged, economically disadvantaged women-owned small, and women-owned small eligible under the Woman-Owned Small Business Program;  <br>    <br>  5. Statement confirming the requirements of FAR 52.219-14 will be met should this acquisition be set-aside for small business (if applicable);  <br>    <br>  6. Contact information, to include name, e-mail address, phone number, and fax number;  <br>  <br> Q&A: <br>  <br> Area of requirement: The geographic boundaries of the National Capital Region. <br>  <br> Previous Contract#: W91WAW-10-A-0001. <br>  <br> Incumbent: Washington Limousine & Coach Corp. <br>  <br> Performance: 1 base year plus four 1 year option periods. <br>  <br>

<DESC>Amendment 00002 (12/05/14): SEE ATTACHED Q&amp;A; The response date for submissions has closed. This Amendment is issued to resolve questions included in the submissions. Late responses and questions may not be considered by the Agency.<br /><br />Amendment 00001 (11/24/14): SEE ATTACHED Q&amp;A<br /><br />Request for Information (RFI) for 47-foot Motor Lifeboat (MLB) Service Life <br />Extension Program (SLEP) Acquisition Strategy:<br /><br /><br />The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is a multi-mission organization tasked with maritime search and rescue, law enforcement, and environmental protection. One of the components for providing this capability in the coastal zone is the 47' MLB, which is self-righting and is capable of operating in up to 20 foot surf and 30 foot open ocean waves. The 47' MLB is constructed of marine grade aluminum and has twin-diesel engine propulsion with fixed-pitch propellers that provide a top speed of 25 knots. The first production 47' MLB entered service in 1997, and the last was delivered in 2003. Please see attachment for an overview of the 47' MLB.<br /><br />The 47' MLB are in need of a major renovation to extend their service life primarily due to system obsolesce and reliability issues. The major tasks include:<br /><br />- Propulsion System Replacement (Diesel Engine, Reversing Reduction Gear, and Prop only; rest of components to be retained)<br />- Ship's Service Alternator Replacement<br />- Crew Seating Replacement<br />- Steering Gear Replacement<br />- Tow Reel Replacement<br />- Fender System Replacement<br />- Removable Deck Plate Replacement<br />- UHF/VHF Direction Finder Replacement<br />- Navigation System Replacement<br />- Remote Control Spotlight<br />- Machinery Space CO2 System Replacement<br />- Auxiliary Machinery Space Fan Replacement<br />- Rudder Replacement<br />- HVAC Chiller &amp; Raw Water Pump Replacement<br />- Window Wiper Replacement<br />- Quick Acting Watertight Hatch Replacement<br /><br />None of these modifications are intended to increase the operational capability of the boats, but will primarily consist of one-for-one replacement of existing systems and equipment. These modifications should not negatively affect the operational characteristics of the boat. The USCG has initiated a Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) to execute these upgrades. There are a total of 117 of the 47' MLB's currently in the Coast Guard fleet, of which, up to 114 could be inducted into the SLEP. <br /><br />This notice is an RFI&nbsp;to gauge industry's capabilities and interest as well as a market research effort to identify the proper procurement strategy to minimize risk for both parties and to maximize efficiency in fulfilling this requirement. The USCG is looking to award a fixed price, Requirements contract to a single Contractor to provide the major pieces of equipment necessary to complete the SLEP along with the associated engineering, on-site technical support, and logistics support, including drawing updates. The largest modification will be the replacement of the main diesel engines. The NAICS code for this requirement is 336611, and the small business size standard is 1,000 employees.<br /><br />The USCG intends to provide a Performance Work Statement (PWS) outlining the requirements for all boat modifications. The USCG may also develop a point design to prove the feasibility of the modifications and confirm that multiple equipment vendors are available. If provided, the point design will not identify equipment by name/model. From this PWS, potential bidders will provide technical proposals that identify specific pieces of equipment that will meet the performance requirements, arrangement drawings that show how all new equipment will be fit onto the boat, a notional weight and moment report showing that the proposed package will not impact weight limitations, a trim &amp; stability analysis showing that the new/relocated equipment will not affect the boats self-righting capability, and an electric power and load analysis showing overall power impacts. The Government will provide drawings and existing technical data as GFI. The Government intends to use a best value, trade-off&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis to evaluate the proposals and award a FFP contract with multiple option years, not to exceed five (5) years.<br />&nbsp;<br />After award, the Contractor would perform detailed engineering and design to incorporate the proposed equipment. Engineering changes would likely be a part of this design process, but these would be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. The deliverables at this phase would be work packages consisting of work specifications, modification drawings, and production cost estimates. This information would be used to award a production contract to have a shipyard execute the modifications and install all equipment provided by the Contractor. The Contractor will also provide all technical documentation (including a list of all Original Equipment Manufacturer part numbers) and prepare lifecycle documents for the post-SLEP 47' MLB. <br /><br />The USCG intends to perform the SLEP on one 47' MLB at the Coast Guard Yard as a prototype to verify &amp; validate the Contractor's work packages and proposed system modifications. Under the contract, the Contractor would be responsible for providing all major pieces of equipment for the prototype availability, and technical oversight during the availability period to ensure proper installation of all systems. The contract will include a prototype evaluation period for Coast Guard evaluation. <br /><br />The Government's intent is for the base period of the contract to include the design of all systems, the corresponding modification work packages, all technical support documentation, and the delivery of equipment to the USCG Yard for the prototype availability. After successful completion of the prototype evaluation, the contract will be structured to have the Contractor provide complete equipment packages delivered on an "as-needed" basis in the form of delivery/task orders issued against an Indefinite Delivery, Requirements Contract for an estimated qty. of 114 boats as well as spare components for life-cycle support. The work packages developed by the Contractor will be used by the USCG to award shipyard availability contracts to the USCG Yard or commercial boat/shipyards for execution of the upgrades. The Contractor would be responsible for timely delivery of all equipment and engineering support during boat/shipyard availabilities for the remainder of the contract. <br /><br />To summarize, the intended scope of supply would be:<br /><br />a) Base Period (firm fixed price):<br />a. One ship set of equipment identified in the proposal<br />b. Engineering calculations for all designs (propulsion, electrical, structural , etc)<br />c. Detailed design work packages (modification drawings, work instruction, and production estimates)<br />d. Equipment technical documentation<br />e. On-site technical support/oversight<br />f. Pre-production modifications based on the results of Operational Testing &amp; Evaluation<br /><br />b) Option Periods (firm fixed price); one per boat for up to 114 boats:<br />a. One ship set of equipment<br />b. On-site technical support/oversight<br /><br />This is not a Solicitation, and proposals are not being requested at this time. Furthermore, there is&nbsp;not an anticipated date for release of a Solicitation at this point. This RFI does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of the submission of Contractor's information. The Government will not pay for any information that is submitted.<br /><br />Questions for Response:<br /><br />1) If the USCG was to provide the point design as Government Furnished Information, how would this impact industry's ability to develop a technical proposal? Alternatively, if it was not provided, how would that affect industry's capability to provide a proposal?<br /><br />2) Would the scope and structure of the proposed approach be feasible in the assessment of industry? What are the perceived risks, and how could the USCG modify or improve this approach to limit risk for both parties?<br /><br />3) The offerors would need to perform some level of engineering design and analysis in order to develop their proposal since the equipment identified in the proposal would become part of the fixed price contract. Would the level of design required to specify all pieces of equipment be feasible to offerors, given the potential scope of this requirement?<br /><br />4) Would offerors feel a high level of confidence in providing a firm, fixed price for the Base Period described above? What changes to the approach or level of information would be necessary to increase confidence and establish firm, fixed prices?<br /><br />5) Would offerors feel a high level of confidence in providing a firm, fixed price for follow-on Option periods to provide equipment packages in support of boat/shipyard availabilities? What changes to the approach or level of information would be necessary to increase offeror's confidence?
<p><br />6) Respondents interested in pursuing this work for the USCG should submit information which clearly describes the company's business size with respect to NAICS code 336611 and the following: (a) technical capabilities to perform the required services and provide the proper equipment, (b) standard, commercial product lines available in the marketplace or modified to meet the USCG's needs, (c) customary practices including commercial warranty, (d) major customers for similar work, and (e) any other information that is pertinent to the acquisition strategy. Questions are also welcome in the responses. Relevant answers will be posted via an amendemnt to this notice.</p>
<p>All responses shall be in writing and directed to the Contracting Officer, Ashley Fetherman, at Ashley.A.Fetherman@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR), Ben Bell, at Benjamin.J.Bell@uscg.mil.</p>

<DESC>SECURE REMOTE ACCESS - Request for Information (RFI) - Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Office of Informatics and Analytics (OIA)

RFI Amendment 00003 - Release additional industry questions and Government answers.

RFI Amendment 00002 - Extend response date to December 8, 2014 and incorporate industry questions and Government answers.

RFI Amendment 00001 - Add additional requests to questions #3 and #4, as well as add a new question (#5).  See below.  

THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT.  THIS IS A RFI ANNOUNCEMENT FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.  RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE USED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION DECISIONS.  THE VA IS NOT, AT THIS TIME, SEEKING PROPOSALS AND WILL NOT ACCEPT UNSOLICITED PROPOSALS.  RESPONDERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL NOT PAY FOR ANY INFORMATION OR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS RFI; ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESPONDING TO THIS RFI WILL BE SOLELY AT THE INTERESTED VENDOR'S EXPENSE.  NOT RESPONDING TO THIS RFI DOES NOT PRECLUDE PARTICIPATION IN ANY FUTURE RFP, IF ANY IS ISSUED.  ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS RFI IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.  ALL SUBMISSIONS BECOME GOVERNMENT PROPERTY AND WILL NOT BE RETURNED.  

VA has identified the need for updated remote access (mechanisms that manage sending and receiving data across the VA network when a VA network user is not directly connected to the VA network) capabilities that will meet the full spectrum of information technology business needs of its remote users.  Remote users, at a minimum, include VA and/or contractor employees that require full-time or intermittent VA network access from any location outside of the VA network, as well as individual employees of other Federal agencies working with VA.

VA is requesting industry feedback on the attached Business Requirements Document (BRD) which identifies the conditions and functionalities that VA desires from any future remote access technology used to support the core business and healthcare operations of VA.  The primary objective of this RFI is to identify technologies / solutions that meet all or most of the requirements in the BRD.  Any proposed remote access technologies / solutions must comply with the Department of Homeland Security Trusted Internet Connections 2.0 Reference Architecture.  After reviewing the BRD, interested and capable offerors are requested to provide the following information. 

1.  Can your proposed technology / solution meet all of the requirements as stated in the BRD (see Section 7 of the BRD)? If not, identify the requirements that cannot be met.

2.  In addition to the requirements of the BRD, VA requests information on suggested tools for monitoring remote access.  In particular, VA requires a tool(s) that analyzes speed and bandwidth from the VA gateways and eliminates the variability introduced by end users' Internet service providers.  

3.  Provide an estimated level of effort (LOE) if VA was to build out the necessary infrastructure to use your proposed technology / solution with a user base of 100,000 remote users.  Provide estimated LOE for all 100,000 remote users being concurrent.  [RFI Amendment 00001:  Also, provide estimated LOE for 150,000 remote users with a maximum concurrent usage of 100,000 remote users. Additionally, is there a functional maximal user count threshold for the recommended solution if significant expansion beyond the user base of 150,000 remote users is necessary?]

4.  Provide estimated costs for your technology / solution based on 100,000 remote users for the two scenarios delineated in question 3 above (i.e. 100,000 users with 50,000 concurrent and 100,000 users with all being concurrent).  [RFI Amendment 00001:  Also provide estimated costs for your technology / solution based on 150,000 remote users with 100,000 concurrent users.]

5.  Provide primary respondent's information (name, phone number, and email address).

SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Please submit the above requested information by 5:00PM EST on December 8, 2014 via email to Robert Kately, Contract Specialist, at Robert.Kately@va.gov.  Responses are requested to be no more than 20 pages.  All proprietary/company confidential material shall be clearly marked on every page that contains such.  VA reserves the right to not respond to any or all emails or materials submitted.  All VA current requirements identified herein are subject to change at any time.

SAIC will continue to provide integration of AF DCGS applications and digital systems within, and interfacing with, the DCGS communications architecture. The focus is on global war fighting operations and weapon system support in the following key ISR mission areas: ISR applications for operations; training and exercise activities, products and support; mission planning products and support; automated data systems; emerging systems and technical evaluations. Additional areas of support required include planning, testing, and systems integration support for the AF DCGS weapon system, and systems integration management for new systems incorporated into the AF DCGS.</p>
<p>This action is a follow-on requirement to contract FA7037-12-F-0062, which was awarded to Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC). GSA modification PS-0039, dated 9 May 2014 recognized a change of name Agreement that allowed SAIC to change their name to Leidos, Inc. It should be noted at the time the Justification and Approval (J&amp;A) was written the Government was unaware PO-0043 dated 15 Aug 2014 incorporated a novation agreement changing the name from Leidos to SAIC. Therefore the contractor's name on the J&amp;A is listed as Leidos. It should also be noted J&amp;A Amendment 01 was written to allow for an increase in the total estimated value of the contract. The name on the J&amp;A Amendment 01 and on the contract FA7037-15-F-0004 is SAIC.</p>
<p>FA7037-15-F-0004 is for a five month base period and three 2-month options. Due to the shortened period of performance, security qualifications, and the need of highly skilled professionals, it is in the best interest of the Government to award this contract to SAIC IAW FAR 8.405-6(a)(1)(i)(C) in the interest of efficiency and economy.</p>

The task order is for services provided to Reclamation in accorance with the Department of the Interior Commercial Wireless Enterprise Services (CWES) NBCA07016 BPA for Cellular wireless services management.

The NAICS code as entered into the PRISM system and on the task order is 517210  Wireless Telecommunication Carriers.  The NACIS code is being overwritten by FPDS-NG and is entered into the FPDS-NG record as 517110-Wired Telecommunication Carriers.  This discrepancy is being noted- the NAICS code is 517210 which is the appropriate code for this requirement and task order.

<AWARDEE>HK&S CONSTRUCTION HOLDING CORP. (026985012)  <br>  51 AMERICAS CUP AVE <br>  NEWPORT, RI 02840
<DESC>The work of this project consists of placement of 4-8 ton stone, underlayer <br> stone, stone bedding and gravel fill filter materials for a 90-foot reach where <br> Hurricane Sandy damaged the seawall and scoured the inclined natural slope <br> behind it. In addition, placement of 4-8 ton stone protection shall be placed <br> seaward of an additional 400-foot stretch of the seawall. The USCG Station <br> Point Judith is located at the southern-most end of Ocean Road in Point <br> Judith, Rhode Island, approximately 32 miles south of Providence, RI and <br> approximately 72 miles southwest of Boston, Massachusetts. The site is <br> bounded by ocean to the south and east, marsh to the west, and a private lot <br> to the north. The 4-8 ton stone protection in front of the seawall will consist of <br> a10-foot wide berm 14 feet above Mean Low Low Water (MLLW) with a 2 on 1 <br> slope to existing ground. A 2-foot layer of 1.5 to 2.5-foot diameter underlayer <br> stone will be keyed into the existing ground just underneath the larger armor <br> stone berm. Approximately 7,000 tons of 4-8 ton stone will be needed to <br> construct the berm in front of 600 LF of seawall, including the damaged reach. <br> For the 90-foot reach of damaged seawall, placement of 290 CY of underlayer <br> stone, 150 CY of stone bedding, 115 CY of crushed stone, and 200 CY of <br> gravel fill will be required. An existing basketball court and adjacent USCG <br> land within the property will be provided for access and material storage. <br> Loose concrete from the damaged seawall must be removed from the site and <br> the basketball court will be replaced. It is also expected that all work will be <br> performed from land, from above or below the existing seawall. However, the <br> area in front of the seawall is impacted by high tide cycles (i.e., toe of the <br> proposed berm is below high tide line). Material deliveries will be limited to <br> daylight hours but material placement will be allowed during a longer time <br> window so that the contractor can work around high tide cycles.
