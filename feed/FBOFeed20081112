<DESC>System Wide Information Management Technical Services Single Source Bridge Contract
Pursuant to AMS 3.2.2.4, the FAA intends to award a one-year single source contract for systems engineering support services to Flatirons Solutions Corporation.  The contract will secure systems engineering services, for the SWIM Program Office of the ATC Communications Directorate, ATO-W.  This award will support the SWIM Program Offices' testing, evaluation and implementation of SWIM core services. The estimated value is $982,000.00.
This award is being made to bridge a shortfall for these services while a competitive procurement is conducted and awarded.  The target date for award of the competitive contract is late 2009 or early 2010.
Flatirons Solutions Corporation was selected because it has been providing substantially similar services to the FAA SWIM Program Office under a sub-contracting arrangement and it has a proven track record of supplying this type of engineering and technical support services to ATO-W.  Therefore, the Contracting Officer has determined that a bridge contract to this contractor will ensure continuity of services, avoid waste, and provide the best value available under the circumstances during the bridge period, for the following reasons:
Flatirons Solutions Corporation has extensive, direct experience in the management and technical development of the SWIM core services acquisition, test and evaluation program.  For instance, a key component of the core services products was recently completed via a competitive procurement for Service Container software.  In connection therewith, Flatirons Solutions Corporation played a key role in the analysis, test and evaluation of all products.  This type of work is substantially the same as the SWIM Program Office require within the next twelve months in its upcoming development efforts.    Continued support from a Contractor that is familiar with the SWIM schedule and programs will reduce schedule risk and avoid waste of resources during the Swim Implementation Program's (SIPs) development.  Additional technical evaluations for core services including an XML gateway, policy server, registry, and testing tools are planned in FY 2009.  Flatirons Solutions Corporation is intimately involved in the current planning and prototyping efforts that are on very short time lines. 
A competitive solicitation is not available for this procurement.  If your firm does not agree with this single source determination, please provide evidence of your firm's capability and experience and the FAA will evaluate that information accordingly. All responses to this announcement must be directed to Dennis L. Scanlon, Contract Specialist by 3:00 P.M., Eastern Time, November 21, 2008.

<a href="mailto:curtis.fields@faa.gov">curtis.fields@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>This market survey is issued in accordance with FAA Acquisition Management System (AMS) paragraph 3.2.1.2.1, to obtain information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside this requirement among small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or 8(a) certified firms.
The FAA intends to procure Integrated Display Systems (IDS) to replace the existing IDS-4 systems at various locations across the United States.  The IDS is a local and wide area network providing a methodology for the acquisition and dissemination of weather and operational data from a multitude of National Airspace System (NAS) and National Weather Service (NWS) systems to Air Traffic Controllers and Managers at Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON), Air Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), Department of Defense, and other facilities as required to provide a complete network. The current IDS-4 uses a DOS based application and hardware no longer supported by industry.  
The FAA intends to replace 2,230 IDS-4 workstations at all existing IDS-4 locations.  The FAA may procure additional workstations to fulfill the same or similar display system requirements at other locations across the National Airspace System (NAS).  The selected vendor will also be required to establish a logistics infrastructure for the display systems, to include: appropriate spare/repair parts; development and presentation of training courses; system manuals and instruction books; second level engineering support, and various types/levels of testing.  The selected vendor will be responsible for the design, development and production of the workstations, including all software, hardware, and firmware development necessary to meet the FAA's minimum requirements.  However, the FAA will retain all rights to software.  The vendor will also be responsible for performing the site preparation, site adaptation, and installation of the system.  
The FAA currently plans to release a Screening Information Request/Request for Proposal (SIR/RFP) in January 2009.  At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program.
The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from large businesses, small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses and 8(a) certified firms, capable of providing an information display system described.  The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, with a size standard of $25 million.  The FAA anticipates the award of an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract by March 2009 with deployment completed by September 2015.  This is not a RFP.  
In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors:
1. Submission of capability statements that clearly demonstrates:(a) the administrative and technical skills and experience required to fully comply with the requirements of this effort; (b) the ability to work successfully within the FAA infrastructure in complying with the safety, security, and operational requirements contained in FAA Orders and Advisory Circulars for performance of duties on airport property or within the confines of secured FAA facilities; and, (c) the availability of a display system similar to that being requested by the FAA for this project.
The Program Requirements Document for IDS-4 Replacement is provided as Attachment A to assist in your response.  Responses shall be submitted on company letterhead, in a type font no less than 12 point and shall not exceed 15 pages in total length.  Excessively elaborate responses containing marketing materials are not desired and may be discarded without review.  Interested vendors shall also submit the Business Declaration Form provided as Attachment B, not to be included in the 15-page submission limitation.
2.  Geographical areas where your company can provide services and; 
3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Vendors must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small, service-disabled veteran-owned  and 8(a) certified businesses.  
The FAA will not pay any costs incurred by the vendor as a result of participation in this survey. Any information provided under this market survey is for informational purposes only and will not be released to the public.  Submission of proprietary information, although not prohibited, is discouraged.  Any proprietary information submitted must be adequately marked as proprietary and will be protected accordingly.  Responses must be received no later than 3:00 PM Eastern Standard Time on December 3, 2008.  The FAA prefers that all submittals, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the Contracting Officer at curtis.fields@faa.gov.  Please submit in either Microsoft Word (*.doc) or portable document file (*.pdf) formats.  If unable to respond electronically, please send three hard copies by the indicated deadline to:

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with MGP Instruments, of Smyrna, Georgia for the purchase of a spectroscopic pedestrian portal monitor and software package under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR subpart 6.302-1: Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. 

The NIST Physics Laboratory requires a spectroscopic pedestrian portal monitor for testing its capabilities for use by first responders, as well as for use in the development of the new ANSI N42.38 standard for spectroscopic portal monitors used for Homeland Security applications.

The SPIR IDENT spectroscopic pedestrian portal monitor from MGP Instruments has been selected as representative of what is currently being deployed in the field for pedestrian applications.  This determination was made based on market research and consultations with experts in the field, and was also based on the fact that the MGP Instruments equipment is already in use in large numbers by first responders as well as Federal agencies (including the IAEA).

Previous instruments for testing have been acquired from Thermo-Electron, Northrop Grumman, and GBS-Electronik.  Future procurements of spectroscopic pedestrian portal monitors from other manufacturers may be made if this pilot program is continued.

Delivery shall be FOB Destination, Gaithersburg, MD, and be completed in accordance with the Contractors commercial schedule.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334513, and the size standard is 500 employees.

No solicitation package will be issued.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations; however, interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  The Government will consider responses received by 3:00 p.m. (EST) on November 27, 2008.  Inquiries will only be accepted via email to paula.wilkison@nist.gov.  No telephone requests will be honored.   

A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement in the future.

Therefore, this acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition. Award wi! ll be based on the written proposal. Anticipated award date will be on or about Nov 21, 2008. Delivery will be to the Receiving Office, Naval Support Activity-Panama City (NSA-PC) 101 Vernon Ave, Panama City Beach, FL 32407-7001. NAICS Code 334419 applies. SBA Size Standard is 750 Employees. FSC is 5895. Point of Contact is Don McManus at 850-235-5392, email address: donald.d.mcmanus@navy.mil.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The purpose of this Pre-Solicitation Notice for the Transportation Threat Assessment & Credentialing (TTAC), Hazmat Threat Assessment Program (HTAP) office is to request contractor support a single-point information management system and web site tool that enables applicants to submit biographic and biometric (fingerprints) information, collect fees, and provide applicants information on services and enrollment locations.  The system will operate totally from the established fees collected according to DHS, TSA, and Hazmat Fee Rules: Fees for Security Threat Assessments for Hazmat Drivers; Final Rule (49CFR Part 1572 January 13, 2005).  

BACKGROUND

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act was enacted on October 25, 2001.  Section 1012 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended 49 U.S.C. Chapter 51 by adding a new section 5103a titled Limitation on Issuance of Hazmat Licenses.  Section 5103a prohibits a State from issuing to any individual a license to transport hazardous materials in commerce unless a determination has been made that the individual does not pose a security risk.  The risk assessment includes checks of relevant criminal history databases, immigration and legal status, and relevant international databases where applicable.  

The TSA Hazardous Materials Endorsement Threat Assessment Program meets this statutory mandate and conducts a Security Threat Assessment (STA) for anyone who seeks to apply for, renew or transfer a Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) on their state-issued Commercial Drivers License (CDL).  The TSA security threat assessment includes a (1) fingerprint-based FBI Criminal History Records Check (CHRC), (2) an immigration/legal status check and (3) an intelligence-related check for ties to terrorism.  
	
Applicants must forward biographical and biometric (fingerprint) information to TSA in an approved and established format to facilitate the security threat assessment process.  TSA allowed States to elect to perform the biographical and biometric collection, or utilize a TSA-contracted agent to perform these functions on their behalf.  Fifteen States currently collect the required biographical information and biometric data through their individually established and maintained programs.  Thirty-Seven States and the District of Columbia utilize the TSA-contracted agent (for the purposes of this document it is understood the term State or States includes the District of Columbia).  Additionally, drivers registered in a state serviced by the contractor (TSA Agent) may be fingerprinted in any other state serviced by the TSA Agent.  

CAPABILITIES COVERAGE

Congress has directed that this program be fee-based and self-sustaining.  TSA established fees to fund the threat assessment after providing the public an opportunity to comment on proposed fees.  The fee per applicant is comprised of three elements:  

(1)	the cost for collecting and processing fingerprint and application information (vendor fee); 
(2)	the fee the FBI charges to run the fingerprints against the criminal history records; and 
(3)	a TSA program fee to cover costs to administer the program, including conducting the security threat assessments.  

Payment of the Federal fee is a requirement to undergo the TSA security threat assessment, and is established through the Federal rule-making process. Vendors must have capability to remit fees collected, directly to TSA.     

TSA seeks to identify a vendor that can provide the following services above.  The system is comprised of the following broad categories:

(1)  Enrollment 
(2)  Fingerprint Collection 
(3)  Help Desk 
(4)  Web site 
(5)  Fee Collection and Reconciliation 
(6)  DHS/TSA IT system requirements 

ADMINISTRATIVE 
The TSA intends to solicit for a Fee Based, Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract on or around the August 29, 2008.   This solicitation will be for a one-year base period and (three) one-year option periods. This will be a best value procurement.   

Any questions or inquiries must be emailed to the TSA Office of Acquisition to Audrey.Taylor@dhs.gov and to Ricky.McGlothin@dhs.gov.

ACRE STATEWIDE BROADBAND PROJECT.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an Acre Statewide Broadband Project for the State of Acres Secretariat of Administrative Management. 

The Feasibility Study will evaluate a statewide broadband project that will provide broadband internet services to the Acre region of Brazil. The Study would assist the Acre Government in defining several aspects of the Project, such as optimal ownership structure, size, limitations, and security of the bandwidth.  In addition, the Study would serve as a basis for developing bidding documents to select private sector partners for the construction and management of the Project.  

The Project has four objectives.  The foremost objective for the Grantee is to build a network linking all government offices via high-speed internet starting with the municipalities of Rio Branco and Cruzeiro do Sul.  This would eliminate redundancies and reduce overall operating costs for government communications.  The second objective is to provide high speed connections to public internet access points, such as schools and health posts.  The third objective is to provide medium-band connections to the general public as a public service.  An optional fourth objective is to provide commercial high-speed internet access for businesses and homes seeking higher bandwidth than that available for free access.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $573,853 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firms name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English and Portuguese directly to the Grantee by 1:00pm (local time), December 29, 2008 at the above address.  In addition to the submission of hard copies, the offeror may also wish to email the proposal to the Grantee.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>Wednesday, November 12, 2008The Department of Veterans, VA Boston Healthcare System, has a requirement for vendor,  Yankee Equipment in Barrington, NH 03825,  for Chicago Dryer, manufacturer of the Edge Maxx, maintains the patent pending technology of the worlds first Cornerless system.  The details of the function of the devices can be identified in the Statement of Work.  It is the Governments intention to solicit and negotiate only with this source.  Please refer to the Sole Source Justification.  This is not a solicitation; it is notice of intent to sole source a requirement.  Inquires/information received after established deadline of November 14, 2008 shall not be considered.  The submission of any data for review shall not impede award of this contract as planned.  The Government does not intend to pay for information solicited.  This synopsis is issued pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.Post in FBO today for 5 days i.e. 11/12/2008   16:00 pm ESTDeadline	   	      11/17/2008   16:00 pm ESTACRONYMS			VA:		VA Medical Center	CO:		Contracting Officer	COTR:		Contracting Officers Technical Representative	FTE:		Full Time Employee	FTEs:		Full Time Employees	JCAHO:	Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organization	OSHA:	Occupational Safety and Health Administration	EST:		Eastern Standard Time JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION1.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity.VA Boston Healthcare System  VISN 1 Laundry Service in Brockton.2.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved.Sole source procurement from Yankee Equipment, Barrington, NH 03825 for Chicago Edge Maxx Cornerless Spreader/Feeder to be utilized at the VISN 1 Laundry Service in Brockton.  The VISN 1 Laundry Service processes linens for the ten Medical Centers and all the Out Patient Clinics within VISN 1.3.	Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencys needs (including the estimated value).523-09-1-1731-0001 for the Spreader/Feeder providing end to end ironing of flat sheets using a clipless system estimated amount $90,596.00. Description: Cornerless Spreader/Feeder (2 Full Time Employees [FTEs] will not be required to feed large linen items, such as sheets, into machine as corner clipping of items will not be required for items to be processed).4.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition.FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(C) (1) only one responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.5.	Demonstration that the proposed contractors unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited.The Spreader/Feeder must provide end to end ironing of flat sheets at a maximum of 900-1000 sheets per hour using a clipless system.  The using of clipless system can reduce 1  2 (FTEs) with the same output.  The spreader/feeder will also record the production rate of each employee and provides a full-length lighting system for inspection, improving quality control.  It also provides pacing lights that will indicate if the machine is functioning at the present rate as selected by management.  	Unlike any other feeding systems the Edge Maxx feeder is a cornerless feeding system, therefore an employee does not need to take the time to find corners of flatwork in order to feed the item. 	Because this cornerless feeder device only offered by Chicago Dryer (patented) eliminates the potential pulling of sheets-end to end, (clip on system) it virtually eliminates the premature tearing of sheets, therefore conceptually sheets last longer before being disposed of (fair-wear and tear reduced)	To achieve production requirements of up to 1,000 pieces per hour the number of employees required to accommodate this feeding requirement is eliminated from 4-5 FTEs-feeding and pulling to 2-3 FTEs (feeding and pulling), a potential savings in FTE(s) of 2 to 3, at $35,000 salary including benefits per year a savings of $70,000 annually. Over the approximate life of 12 years for the feeder that represents a savings (cost avoidance of $840,000).	Because of the patented designs of the Edge Maxx sheets do not drag across the floor prior to entering the machine (ironer).  The clip on systems do allow sheets to drag on the floor and this has been cited by several JCAHO inspectors in the past as a sanitation challenge and by OSHA as a tripping hazard to employees feeding the ironer.	The Edge Maxx Feeder is currently used by numerous VA facilities and has been purchased recently as a sole source item in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulations without any industry challenges by VA in Oklahoma City, St. Albans (Brooklyn), West Los Angeles and Perry Point MD.	It is very important for all the VA facilities to standardize all their equipments for interchangeable operations.6.	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies.The vendor, Chicago Edge Maxx holds patent on Cornerless System.  We tried to contact other vendors, however, they were unable to provide the same services.Will post on FBO for 5 days from November 12, 2008 16:00 pm EST  November 17, 2008 16:00 pm EST.7.	Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonableThe contracting officer (CO) anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable because of the potential savings of $70,000 annually.  If the machine can run 12 years that means a savings of $840,000.00 for the government.8.	Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted.There are no other manufacturers that produce a product with the same features process 900  1000 sheets without dragging the sheet across the floor prior to entering the ironing machine.  This is very critical for passing the inspection from JCAHO and OSHA.  This can eliminate the tripping hazard for the employees feeding the ironer. 9.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available.Another exclusive capability to the Edge Maxx is the Gapbuster linen flow accelerator (patent pending).  This feature senses the distance between fed sheets and accelerates Edge Maxxs exit conveyor as needed to reduce the gap.  This increases the number of pieces that can be processed through the system and helps keep the ironer fully covered.  This design provides the direct path feeding which is faster and more compact.  It eliminates the extra turn to rotate linen 90 degrees before entering the ironer.   10.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition.None to date.11.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required.Contracting activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.    Statement of WorkVendor is to provide:1)	Delivers and sets up one Chicago Edge Maxx Cornerless spreader/feeder to the specific location of existing ironers;2)	The Spreader/Freeder is to be utilized at the VISN 1 Laundry in Brockton.  The VISN 1 Laundry processes linens for the ten Medical Centers, as well as, all the Out Patient Clinics within VISN1;3)	The Spreader/Freeder must provide end to end ironing of flat sheets using a CLIPLESS system;4)	Performs a system check and provides training to VA personnel; 5)	Makes adjustments if necessary.Point of Contact :   Contracting Officer Christine.Gorman@va.govDELIVERY	On or before March 31, 2009.

<DESC>This Market Survey is to determine interest in sources for retrofitting the US Governments  (USG) M67 Hand Grenade inventory. Potentially over 500,000 M67s will require fuze replacement. This market survey is for information purposes only to identify sources interested in performing the retrofit activities.  M67: The M67 is the U.S. Armys fragmenting hand grenade.  It consists of 3 parts: M213 fuze, M67 body, and explosive fill. The M213 fuze is a detonating type of fuze using a C70 detonator (containing primary and secondary explosives). The fill used on the M67 is Comp B.  Confidence Clip: A recent change to the M67 is the addition of a confidence clip. The clip is a stamped metal part that is assembled between the fuze and the grenade body, aiding in the prevention of accidental removal of the pull ring.  It is not, however, considered a safety feature.  One change to the M213 fuze that the Confidence Clip required, is the lengthening of the safety pin on the fuze. The safety pin is approx 0.100 longer than the current pin.  A prospective respondent to this market research should have the following at a minimum: 1) Ability to store high explosive filled items; 2)	Ability to safely remove fuzes from a spherically shaped grenade; 3) Ability to heat metal grenade bodies filled with explosives in a controlled environment (humidity/temperature); 4) Automated inspection system to detect critical defects on lever, safety clip, pull ring assembly and delay column defects.  This includes X-Ray capability; 5) Assembly equipment capable of installing a confidence clip onto a M213 fuze/M67 without compromising safety pin withdrawal resistance; 6) Manufacturing equipment capable of disassembling/assembling fuze to grenade at a specified torque; 7) Mark old M67 bodies with updated appropriate markings; 8) Test equipment capable of measuring pull force required to remove safety pin and torque necessary to disengage pull ring from Confidence Clip; 9) Test facilities to accommodate testing and functioning of M213 fuzes; 10)	Test facilities to accommodate testing and functioning of the M67 end item; 11) Ability to procure non GFM: packaging, Automated Inspection Equipment (AIE), assembly machinery, Confidence Clips, washer, and washer retainer; 12) Esimated delivery rate of 30K/month.  Other desired capabilities: 1) Capability to properly Demil the removed M213 fuzes; 2) Ability to re-pin M213 fuzes with a longer safety pin.  The USG envisions providing as GFM the following: pallets of M67 hand grenades in existing packaging, new M213 fuzes with longer safety pins, Confidence Clips, and Ammunition Data Cards on the existing grenades.  Interested sources shall respond with their current capabilities to remove fuzes from GFM M67 units, dry out M67 bodies containing energetics, remark/repaint M67s where necessary, assemble GFM confidence clips to GFM M213 fuzes, and assemble M213 fuzes to the old bodies. Testing required includes prove-out of the assembly processes, disengagement torque of pull ring from confidence clip, and function testing of the M67 end item.  In addition, interested sources shall provide an estimate of the monthly rate to perform the above activities, minimum and maximum rates per month, ROM of the cost to perform the above activities; and an estimated time frame of when the retrofit activities could be started (months after award of contract).  This information shall be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of this publication to HQ, Army Contracting Command, ATTN: AMSCC-RCC-AM/Stephanie Migawa; stephanie.migawa@us.army.mil, BLDG 350, Rock Island, IL 61299-6500.

(NIEHS)  plans to procure toxicological consultant/expert services for the National 
Toxicology Program. This notice constitutes a combined synopsis/solicitation, and a 
separate written solicitation will not be issued. 
								
Statement of Work: The preparation of the 12th Report on Carcinogens (RoC) requires specialized toxicological assistance in order to publish the 12th RoC in a timely manner. The Report on Carcinogens (RoC) is a congressionally mandated biennial report that is prepared by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) on behalf of the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The latest edition of the RoC, the 11th RoC, was published in 2005. In 2004 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) published peer-reviewed guidelines that required that the RoC review process be revised, and after considerable deliberations with both the OMB and HHS, the NTP announced its revised review process in April 2007. The NTP was not able to initiate the review of new nominations for the 12th RoC until 2007, which has delayed the publication of the 12th RoC. In order to publish the RoC in time, the staff requires assistance from a consultant with experience in preparing the types of products needed to publish the RoC and familiarity with the RoC review process. Task 1: Review of the Draft Background Documents. The background document is the primary resource for the scientific information for applying the criteria and making a recommendation for listing the nomination in the RoC. It also serves as a resource for information that can be used in preparing the listing profile published in the RoC. It discusses the relevant exposure and scientific information, including data on use, production, and exposure from environmental sources, within the general population, and in the workplace, and human epidemiology, animal, genotoxicity and mechanistic studies from the publicly available peer-reviewed literature. The offeror will assist in the review, revision, and update of the draft background documents that were initiated over the last three years, before they are disseminated to the expert panel for peer review. The offeror will be assigned to a specific section or sections and will focus their evaluation on these sections, but will also review the entire document to insure consistency. The offeror may be asked to assist the RoC contractor in identifying relevant literature for updating the draft background documents, and may be asked to write subsections of the documents. The offeror will provide his/her input for proposed changes or edits to the background document. The background document should be complete, accurate, and the information should be presented in a timely and objective manner. The offeror may be required to attend some of the NTP RoC Expert Panel meetings.  (Estimated number of hours for Task 1: 200 plus travel costs).Task 2: Review of the Substance Profiles for Current Listings. The 12th RoC is unique in that an initiative has been made to update and check the technical accuracy of all the summary profiles for substances currently listed in the 12th RoC (the current practice had been to update the exposure information of about 25 summary profiles per RoC edition). This task is the responsibility of the RoC Contractor, but the Support Contractor needs technical advice and guidance in performing the task because of the scope of the project (over 200 profiles), expertise needed to review new carcinogenicity data published since the substance was first listed in the RoC, and the high standard of technical accuracy required for this congressionally mandated document. The offeror will act as a consultant to the Support Contractor to complete this task and will (1) review and revise strategies, such as literature search strategies and sources to complete this task, (2) carefully review and edit the summary profile drafted by the Support Contractor, and (3) if necessary, draft text describing new carcinogenicity data. Similar to the background documents, drafts of the updated profiles may undergo several cycles of revisions and informed input from the offeror in the process will ensure that the final product be scientifically accurate.

<DESC>The USCG Engineering Logistics Center has a requirement for repair/refurbishment of the following: 1) NSN 2920-12-305-2407, ELECTRICAL ENGINE STARTER, BOSCH SICHERHEITSSYSTEME GMBH Part number: 680S638P01, Quantity 10 each in accordance with the following overhaul description:

PRELIMINARY INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS:

Each Starter Motor shall be inspected as received to determine the extent of required repairs.  The contractor shall provide a cost estimate that includes all labor hours, material and parts to overhaul/repair the Starter Motor.  The serial number of the Starter Motor shall be included on the cost estimate.

Additionally, each Starter Motor shall be inspected and verified to have a thirteen (13) tooth bendix drive gear and a five (5) lug terminal configuration.  If the bendix drive gear or terminal lug configuration is not as stated, no further work shall be accomplished and the U.S. Coast Guard Contracting Officer shall be notified.

OVERHAUL REQUIREMENT:
The Starter Motor shall be overhauled/repaired to a condition which shall restore the operating and performance characteristics to the Robert Bosch GMBH Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) design specifications and standards.  The overhaul shall be performed in accordance with OEM specifications and standards to include upgrades as applicable.  

QUALITY ASSURANCE:
Each Starter Motor shall have a tag attached to a connection terminal annotating the overhaul facility name and address.

Each Starter Motor shall have a tag attached to terminal 50 with instructions for the end user to ensure the jam nut is properly secured while tightening down the terminal cable hold-down nut. 

After completion of the overhaul/repair of the Starter Motor, the contractor shall perform standard production tests to assure maximum design performance to include but not limited to the following tests:

Each terminal on each Starter Motor shall be checked for its ground wall insulation resistance value to the Starter Motor case after final assembly using a 500 volt meggohmeter.

The final test reading shall not be less than 100 meggohms on a meter scale of R x 1000 minimum.  The megger shall have a current calibration which shall not have exceeded one year since the previous calibration.  Prior to conducting the test, both megger test leads shall be attached to the Starter Motor case and a reading of zero ohms shall be obtained, thus assuring an adequate ground connection to the Starter Motor case.  The ground lead shall remain connected and NOT be removed or relocated prior to any insulation resistance test.  If the ground lead is removed for ANY reason, the Starter Motor zero reading shall be verified using the procedure described above prior to the final test.

When insulation is exposed to a humid atmosphere, it absorbs moisture and the insulation resistance decreases.  Additionally, the amount of moisture absorption is increased by the amount of time the insulation is exposed to a humid atmosphere.  The resistance value also depends upon the type of insulation and its condition.  Since moisture may be driven off or evaporated by the application of heat, the insulation resistance of a winding having a low resistance reading, due to the presence of moisture, may be restored by energizing or externally heating the winding.  Therefore, the Starter Motor can be heated prior to the test.  Regardless of the test conditions, the Starter Motor shall not have a resistance value below 100 meggohms.  The contractor may, at his discretion, conduct the test in a controlled environment.  After any application of heat to the Starter Motor?s exterior, the Starter Motor shall be allowed to cool to ambient temperature, prior to the final pass fail insulation resistance test.  (Pass=greater than 100 meggohms). 
  
The contractor shall provide a Certificate of Conformance for each Starter Motor; one copy shall be placed in each box with the Starter Motor and one copy shall be forwarded to the Coast Guard Contracting Officer.


WARRANTY:

__X_ A. Standard Manufacturers Warranty

____ B. Item being repaired as an onboard repair or system stock item and will be put into inventory.  NOT FOR IMMEDIATE INSTALLATION.  Contractor must guarantee item against defects that lead to failure for 90 days after installation for a period of up two (2) years after delivery to Coast Guard.

PRESERVATION:

Each Starter Motor shall be coated on the external surfaces with white paint to a dry film thickness of 3-5 mils. 

PRESERVATION / PACKAGING:

PACKAGING/PACKING:
Each Starter Motor shall be individually packed in a wooden box with internal bracing which shall be capable of providing adequate protection during storage and multiple shipments.  

The shaft of each Starter Motor shall be blocked and protected so that force applied in any direction during shipping and handling will not cause damage to the shaft.

<DESC>A004: 
Question:

Request some clarification with respect to the revised SOW for the tendered Assessment Mission: Turkey - Energy Diversification and Efficiency Projects
The previous SOW contained the two following tasks which seem to have been eliminated in the new document.

It (the Assessment Mission, sic) will evaluate a wide range of investment options to meet Turkeys electricity needs and make general recommendations on mix of technologies such that Turkey is not excessively dependent on any one type of fuel or any particular source of fuel.

The Assessment Mission will make recommendations on policy and regulatory reforms that could encourage more private sector investment in the Turkish Energy sector.

As these are quite substantive tasks which comprised a significant portion of the previous SOW, we wish to confirm that it is indeed the intent of the revised SOW to eliminate these two deliverables.

Response: 
Answer:
Yes, it is indeed the intent of the revised SOW to eliminate these two deliverables

These obligations do no cease upon the expiration or termination of this contract.  The Contractor shall include the substance of this provision in all contracts of employment and in all subcontracts hereunder.<BR><BR>The Office of Monitoring and Incident Response (DS/CS/MIRD), Department of State (DoS), is processing this acquisition. This Justification and Approval (J&A) on a brand name only basis is for the use of Dell servers and a Dell NAS.  The use of a brand name description is essential to MIRDs requirements, for the DoS network, established infrastructure, and scanning and vulnerability requirements, thereby precluding consideration of the products of another company.

The ACFO-FS accomplishes this by maintaining the corporate financial management system, the Foundation Financial Information System, corporate reporting through the Financial Statement Data Warehouse, agency reporting thorough the Financial Data Warehouse, an Automated Cash Reconciliation Work Sheet used for daily reconciliation with the United States Treasury, the Purchase Card Management System, the Travel System, the Personal Property System, and the Purchase Order System.

<DESC><p>INTRODUCTION The Transportation Threat Assessment &amp; Credentialing (TTAC), Hazmat Threat Assessment Program (HTAP) office is to request contractor support a single-point information management system and web site tool that enables applicants to submit biographic and biometric (fingerprints) information, collect fees, and provide applicants information on services and enrollment locations. The system will operate totally from the established fees collected according to DHS, TSA, and Hazmat Fee Rules: Fees for Security Threat Assessments for Hazmat Drivers; Final Rule (49CFR Part 1572 January 13, 2005). BACKGROUND The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act was enacted on October 25, 2001. Section 1012 of the USA PATRIOT Act amended 49 U.S.C. Chapter 51 by adding a new section 5103a titled &ldquo;Limitation on Issuance of Hazmat Licenses.&rdquo; Section 5103a prohibits a State from issuing to any individual a license to transport hazardous materials in commerce unless a determination has been made that the individual does not pose a security risk. The risk assessment includes checks of relevant criminal history databases, immigration and legal status, and relevant international databases where applicable. The TSA Hazardous Materials Endorsement Threat Assessment Program meets this statutory mandate and conducts a Security Threat Assessment (STA) for anyone who seeks to apply for, renew or transfer a Hazardous Materials Endorsement (HME) on their state-issued Commercial Drivers License (CDL). The TSA security threat assessment includes a (1) fingerprint-based FBI Criminal History Records Check (CHRC), (2) an immigration/legal status check and (3) an intelligence-related check for ties to terrorism. Applicants must forward biographical and biometric (fingerprint) information to TSA in an approved and established format to facilitate the security threat assessment process. TSA allowed States to elect to perform the biographical and biometric collection, or utilize a TSA-contracted agent to perform these functions on their behalf. Fifteen States currently collect the required biographical information and biometric data through their individually established and maintained programs. Thirty-Seven States and the District of Columbia utilize the TSA-contracted agent (for the purposes of this document it is understood the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; or &ldquo;States&rdquo; includes the District of Columbia). Additionally, drivers registered in a state serviced by the contractor (TSA Agent) may be fingerprinted in any other state serviced by the TSA Agent. CAPABILITIES COVERAGE Congress has directed that this program be fee-based and self-sustaining. TSA established fees to fund the threat assessment after providing the public an opportunity to comment on proposed fees. The fee per applicant is comprised of three elements: (1) the cost for collecting and processing fingerprint and application information (vendor fee); (2) the fee the FBI charges to run the fingerprints against the criminal history records; and (3) a TSA program fee to cover costs to administer the program, including conducting the security threat assessments. Payment of the Federal fee is a requirement to undergo the TSA security threat assessment, and is established through the Federal rule-making process. Vendors must have capability to remit fees collected, directly to TSA. TSA seeks to identify a vendor that can provide the following services above. The system is comprised of the following broad categories: (1) Enrollment (2) Fingerprint Collection (3) Help Desk (4) Web site (5) Fee Collection and Reconciliation (6) DHS/TSA IT system requirements ADMINISTRATIVE The TSA intends to solicit for a Fee Based, Firm Fixed Priced (FFP) contract. This solicitation will be for a one-year base period and (three) one-year option periods. This will be a best value procurement. 227-2329</p>

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION:  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION; no award will be made as a result of this request.  This request for information is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). All interested parties are encouraged to respond to this RFI. The Government will not pay for information and materials received in response to this RFI and is in no way obligated by the information received.<BR><BR>1. SCOPE. <BR>Background: The mission of the U.S. Army Rapid Equipping Force (REF) is to rapidly increase mission capability while reducing risk to Soldiers and others by equipping operational commanders with off-the-shelf (government or commercial) solutions or near-term developmental items that can be researched, developed and acquired quickly.  The REF receives requirements from operational commanders in war zones setting forth the capabilities needed.  The REF is chartered by the Senior Army leadership to provide material solutions to meet these requirements in a significantly reduced timeline compared to traditional Department of Defense acquisition procedures.<BR><BR>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to obtain potential solutions to protect soldiers against wire strikes.  Wire strikes by coalition forces vehicles remains a significant hazard to soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan.  High profile vehicles such as the MRAP (Mine Resistant Ambush Protected) families as well as HMMWV (HUMVEE) based platforms are at risk.  Increases in technological add-ons often increase the vertical profile of vehicles.  As a result Soldiers conducting mounted patrols are making contact with electrical power lines that cross over the street.  These wire strikes have resulted in vehicle and weapons system damage/loss and soldier injury.  <BR><BR>Units across various parts of the region have fabricated potential solutions for specific platforms however coalition forces require a universal wire strike mitigation kit for vehicles.<BR><BR>Experience and information obtained from this request for information will be provided to the U.S. Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) for a potential acquisition of one or more of the potential solutions.<BR><BR>2. REQUIREMENTS. <BR>The REF is looking for a vehicular-mounted system that will protect platforms, electronics and personnel from the electrical hazards posed by low hanging wires as vehicles travel in areas where this situation could occur.  <BR><BR>The system should be installable and repairable by the individual user, i.e. by Soldiers and must be an install and forget system, i.e. once installed it must operate without Soldier input.  <BR><BR>The system must be capable of allowing a power line to slide over the highest profile of the vehicle without snagging.<BR><BR>The system must be constructed in such a manner that prevents electrical current from moving through the system to the vehicle.<BR><BR>It is desired that the system not require any permanent changes to any platform on which the system is mounted, e.g. use of universal mounting brackets.  <BR><BR>The system must not negatively impact the effectiveness of visibility, communications, or jamming capabilities.<BR><BR>The system must operate, as a minimum, while vehicle is traveling at speeds up to 25 MPH; and optimally while vehicle is traveling at speeds up to 45 MPH.<BR><BR>The system should not damage overhead wires and deny populace of the use of power.<BR><BR>3. DELIVERABLES<BR>Specific information on industry capability to produce a system that can meet the requirements identified in paragraph 2 above.<BR><BR><BR>This is NOT a Request for Proposal.
