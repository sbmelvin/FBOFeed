<SUBJECT>Notice of Intent to Extend Contract No. NRC-33-11-325 to Enable Final Transition to Successor Contractors
<SOLNBR>NRC-33-11-325
<RESPDATE>042018
<ARCHDATE>04272018
<CONTACT>Domonique Malone, Email Domonique.Malone@nrc.gov - Joseph Widdup, Email Joseph.Widdup@nrc.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) intends to noncompetitively increase the maximum value of Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity Contract No. NRC-33-11-325 with NTT DATA Services Federal Government, Inc. (DUNS 175344753) ("NTT DATA") for Information Technology Infrastructure Support Services ("ITISS:") and extend the period of performance of that contract beyond its current expiration date of April 30, 2018 to allow time for the remaining replacement contract vehicle to be competitively awarded and to provide sufficient time for all remaining transition activities from the ITISS contract to occur.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>In January 2017, the NRC announced its intent to award several GSA Federal Supply Schedule Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs) for the NRC's GLobal Infrastructure and Development Acquisition (GLINDA) multiple award acquisition.  However, before the NRC could award those BPAs, several unsuccessful offerors protested the award decisions to the General Accountability Office (GAO).  In accordance with the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (CICA), award and subsequent utilization of the new BPAs were subject to a mandatory suspension until the GAO resolved the protests on May 19, 2017.</p>
<p>The multiple-month protest period caused a significant delay in the NRC's ability to compete replacement BPA Calls and transition those requirements from the ITISS contract to the awarded BPA calls and to other related acquisitions.  To date, the Security Operations Center (SOC) BPA Call, the GLINDA Mobility Services BPA Call and the End-User Computing BPA Call have been competitively awarded.  The SOC and Mobility Services BPA Calls have been fully transitioned, and while the End-User BPA Call has been recently awarded, the transition process is expected to take approximately 60 days.  In addition, the sole remaining BPA Call acquisition that must be awarded and transitioned before transition from the ITISS contract can fully occur is the Systems, Network, and Related Cross-Cutting Services (SNCC) BPA Call.  The NRC is currently evaluating quotations for SNCC and, if discussions are required, award is anticipated for late June 2018.  Accordingly, the NRC requires an extension and corresponding increase to the maximum value of the ITISS contract to ensure continuity of services until the services can be completely transitioned from NTT DAA to successor Contractors (which may themselves be protested and cause further delays in the NRC's transition).  The period of performance of this extension potentially includes the following four option periods (which will only be exercised if absolutely necessary):</p>
<p>a.	May 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018<br />b.	October 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018<br />c.	January 1, 2019 to January 31, 2019<br />d.	February 1, 2019 to February 28, 2019</p>
<p>The maximum value being added to the ITISS contract for those potential option periods is $23,750,000.</p>
<p>This modification to the ITISS contract is necessary because only NTT DATA has the necessary knowledge, experience, and personnel with required access authorizations and NRC security clearances to maintain continuity of the NRC's critical IT services until remaining transition activities can be completed for the End-User BPA Call and so that remaining evaluation, discussions (if necessary), award and transition activities can occur for the SNCC BPA Call.  Additionally, NTT DATA is the only responsible source that can satisfy this short-term transitional requirement.</p>
<p>Awarding a short-term contract to any other Contractor is not feasible for the following reasons:</p>
<p>&bull; It would take many, many months to conduct a competitive acquisition, and that acquisition process would require a transition from NTT DATA to a party that may or may not be among the awardees of the GLINDA BPA competitions and other planned awards.</p>
<p>&bull; Transition of the existing services to another Contractor would take a minimum of three months.  Because the ITISS contract will soon expire, the window allowing for competitively awarding a new contract and transitioning to a new source is extremely short.  Transition activities will include the procurement of physical assets that are currently leased from the incumbent Contractor, the migration of support for those assets and infrastructure services from NTT DATA, and establishment of a smooth migration of support services from the incumbent Contractor.</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor personnel are required to comply with NRC security standards.  All Contractor personnel with access to sensitive data must be granted IT access authorization by the NRC Division of Facilities and Security.  This process typically takes two to four months to obtain the necessary authorizations and clearances, and not extending the incumbent contract would cause an unacceptable lapse in IT services.</p>
<p>&bull; The competitive acquisitions for the GLINDA BPA calls and other vehicles could be protested by unsuccessful offerors, and that could require the NRC to stay the performance on the new contract(s) and jeopardize the NRC from meeting its mission requirements.</p>
<p>&bull; Competing a new short-term contract would not be cost effective.  The cost of conducting a competitive acquisition and then transitioning to a short-term Contractor just for the period of the requested extension would cost the NRC millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition for this acquisition is 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, which provides for limiting competition in those situations where only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  No source other than NTT DATA can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a competitive acquisition for this short-term need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements and substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

The Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Act of 1997, (15 U.S.C. 631) created the HUBZone Program to provide Federal contracting assistance for qualified small business concerns located in historically underutilized business zones, in an effort to increase employment opportunities, investment, and economic development in those areas.  

    b.  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 19.1303(d), to be eligible for a HUBZone contract, a HUBZone small business concern must be a HUBZone small business concern both at the time of its initial offer and at the time of contract award.

    c.  Also note the contract performance cost for personnel as stated in FAR 52.219-3(d)(4).

        "(4) Construction by special trade contractors.

            (i) At least 25 percent of the cost of contract performance to be incurred for personnel will be spent on the HUBZone prime contractor's employees;

            (ii) At least 50 percent of the cost of the contract performance to be incurred for personnel will be spent on the HUBZone prime contractor's employees or on a combination of the HUBZone prime contractor's employees and employees of HUBZone small business concern subcontractors;

            (iii) No more than 50 percent of the cost of contract performance to be incurred for personnel will be subcontracted to concerns that are not HUBZone small business concerns."

9.  SITE VISIT:  There will be only one scheduled pre-proposal site visit. The location, date, and time for that site visit is as follows:

Location: 
Pea Ridge National Military Park
Visitor Center
15930 Highway 62
Garfield, Arkansas 72732

Date:  Monday, April 16, 2018
Time:  10:00 a.m. central time

Offerors are encouraged and expected to attend the scheduled site visit, to inspect the site, and to satisfy themselves regarding the conditions that may affect the cost of the products and performance.  In no event shall failure to inspect the site constitute grounds for a claim after contract award. 

10.  PUBLICIZING:  The official solicitation package (RFP) is posted to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at https://www.fbo.gov, and on the FedConnect website at https://www.fedconnect.net. The keyword/solicitation/reference number for the solicitation will be RFP 140P6218R0015. The Contracting Officer will not provide hardcopies or email copies of the solicitation. It is the responsibility of the offerors to monitor the FBO and FedConnect websites to download the solicitation, specifications and drawings, other attachments, and all amendments issued against the solicitation. 

12.  RESPONSE TIME AND AWARD:  Response time for submission of all proposals will be Wednesday, May 16, 2018 at 3:00 p.m. central time.  The method in which proposals are to be submitted and the criteria used to evaluate the proposals are found in Attachment 8 - Addendum to Clause 52.215-1 - Specific Instructions to Offerors, and in Section M - Evaluation Factors for Award.  This is a competitive selection subject to FAR 15.101-1, Tradeoff Process. The Government will make a single award of a firm fixed-price construction contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements, will be the best value and most advantageous to the Government when applying the trade-off methodology of evaluation for selection. Price Proposal, Technical Proposal, and Past Performance will be evaluated.  Technical Proposal and Past Performance are of equal importance, and when combined, are significantly more important than Price. 
 
REGISTRATION:  Pursuant to FAR Subpart 19.1303(d), to be eligible for a HUBZone contract, a HUBZone small business concern must be a HUBZone small business concern both at the time of its initial offer and at the time of contract award.  All offerors are to have a Unique Entity Identifier* (UEI) number, be registered and active in the System for Award Management (SAM) at https://www.sam.gov, have completed their Representations and Certifications (Reps & Certs) and be represented as an SBA-certified HUBZone small business under the NAICS Code of 238160, in order to be awarded a contract; therefore, if you are not already registered and active in SAM, or have not completed your Representations and Certifications at https://www.sam.gov, it is strongly advised that you do so at this time. Failure on the part of the successful offeror to fulfill these requirements by the time the Contracting Officer makes award may result in award of the contract being made to the next otherwise successful offeror.  

*NOTE: Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) number - formerly known as DUNS number.

If you require assistance with acquiring a UEI* number, completing your SAM Registration, Representations and Certifications, adding the assigned NAICS Code to your Reps & Certs, or accessing the solicitation and its attachments, please contact the Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) closest to you. PTAC locations can be found at http://www.aptac-us.org/new/.

POINT OF CONTACT: The point of contact for this Solicitation is Kathryn M. Logsdon, Contracting Officer, and can be reached by phone at (217) 391-3225, or by e-mail at kathryn_logsdon@nps.gov.
