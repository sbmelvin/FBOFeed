It is anticipated that this requirement is competitive.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR Clause 52.209-1.  AWARD WILLNOT BE WITHHELD WAITING QUALIFICATION.  Potential sources are not to utilize intellectual property of third parties without appropriate authorization of the intellectual property owner.  Potential sources are cautioned that no part of the Government property qualification requirement is intended to endorse or encourage the improper use of intellectual property developed by the Original Equipment Manufacturer or any other third party.  For qualification information/source approval request contact Ben Jones/DLA AOB (405) 734-8241.
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(a) (1), Justification: supplies (or Services) required shall be obtained through the use of competitive procedures.  
This notice of intent is not a request for competition.  However, all proposals received within 45 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
Note:  While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation.
Note: An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.

The proposed contract action is for supplies in which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The existence of the ombudsman does not affect the authority of the program manager, contracting officer, or source selection official. The purpose of the ombudsman is to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the contracting office. Interested parties are invited to contact the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129.

<DESC>The DLA Troop Support intends to solicit for a full-line of produce support for DoD (Troop) and Non-DoD (USDA School) customers located in the State of West Virginia. This is a 100% Small Business Set Aside acquisition. The total length of the contract will be four (4.0) years. It will contain one (12 month) tier and two (18 month) tier periods. <br />The resultant award will be for an indefinite delivery contract, with a guaranteed minimum of 10% of the first year of the contract.<br />Its estimated maximum dollar amount is $42,000,000.00. The delivery points require indefinite quantities of Fresh Fruit and Vegetables throughout the term of the contract. A more detailed listing of the delivery sites can be found in the solicitation. All responsible sources may submit proposals that will be considered by DLA Troop Support.
<p>This solicitation will be issued under FAR 15.101-2 Low Price Technically Acceptable (LTPA). The Government will award a contract(s) resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror(s) whose offer(s) conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br />1. Technical Acceptability - A technically acceptable offer is an offer that takes no exceptions to the terms and conditions in the solicitation and complies fully with all submission requirements, including submissions relating to the two subfactors listed below. A proposal that takes exception to solicitation terms and conditions or that fails to comply with all submission requirements may be deemed technically unacceptable and, thus, may be found ineligible, and removed from further consideration, for the award. By submitting a proposal with no exceptions, an offeror is confirming it possesses the necessary facilities, equipment, technical skills and capacity to successfully provide all items required by this solicitation. The following sub-factors will be evaluated and must be found acceptable for a proposal to be eligible for award:</p>
<p>A. Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (PACA) License - The offeror shall possess and submit proof of a valid current PACA license.</p>
<p>B. USDA Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and Good Handling Practices (GHP) Audit - The offeror shall submit a valid GAP/GHP audit report / certificate, covering various fresh fruits and vegetables, for each place of performance identified in the offeror's proposal. The audit report(s) must demonstrate that a passing score(s) was/were received.</p>
<p>2. Pricing - Pricing is required for all items found in the Schedule of Items (for each Group, if applicable) and for all tiers. Failure to offer pricing for all items and for all tiers may result in a proposal being removed from consideration for award as technically unacceptable. The Government will perform an aggregate price analysis on all items found in the Schedule of Items (for each Group, if applicable). To determine an offeror's Evaluated Aggregate Price, the Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price will be added to the Aggregate Delivered Price. Please refer to paragraph (d) of this provision for further details regarding these price components. The award(s) will be made on the basis of the lowest Evaluated Aggregate Price (for each Group, if applicable) of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-price factors. The Government reserves the right to remove item(s) from the Schedule of Items or do a common item comparison if offerors do not submit pricing for all items. Prior to award, the offered prices of the presumptive awardee(s) will be evaluated on an individual line-item basis to determine whether each price is fair and reasonable using analytical techniques deemed appropriate by the Contracting Officer in her/his complete discretion.</p>
<p>(b) Options are not included in this solicitation.</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer,mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(d) Price Components:</p>
<p>1. Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price:</p>
<p>Aggregate Distribution Price is obtained by first multiplying the proposed distribution price for each item in the Schedule of Items by the item's estimated quantity to calculate the total distribution price for each item. Then, the total distribution prices of all items will be added together to determine the total distribution price for tier 1. The total distribution price for each subsequent tier will also be calculated. The total distribution prices for all tiers will be added together to determine the Aggregate Distribution Price. The Aggregate Distribution Price is then multiplied by a weighting factor of 6 to arrive at the Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price. Note: the weighting factor is applied only to the overall Aggregate Distribution Price (not on a line item basis), and is to be used for evaluation purposes only. The Government's use of a weighting factor of 6 for distribution pricing is done in order to more accurately balance the significance of the pricing components and their respective impact on any subsequent contract(s) issued under this solicitation.</p>
<p>2. Aggregate Delivered Price:</p>
<p>The Aggregate Delivered Price is obtained by first multiplying the proposed delivered price of each item in the Schedule of Items by the item's estimated quantity to calculate the total delivered price for each item. Then, the total delivered prices of all items will be added together to determine the total delivered price for tier 1. The total delivered price for each subsequent tier will also be calculated. The total delivered prices for all tiers will be added together to determine the Aggregate Delivered Price.</p>
<p>3. Evaluated Aggregate Price:</p>
<p>The Evaluated Aggregate Price is obtained by adding the Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price and and Aggregate Delivered Price together.</p>
<p>4. For purposes of the Price Proposal Evaluation, Weighted Aggregate Distribution Price and Aggregate Delivered Price are considered equal. This equality is accounted for mathematically by applying a weighting factor of 6 (based on current Government data) to the Aggregate Distribution Price.</p>
<p>See www.ams.usda.gov/services/auditing/gap-ghp/audit for details concerning program and certification.<br /><span style="FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Copies of the solicitation will be found on here (future posting) and the DLA-EBS Internet Bid Board System at https://www.dibbs.bsm.dla.mil.

<DESC>The purpose of this market survey is to solicit capability statements from industry regarding the logistical maintenance of three Federal Advisory Committees (FACs).  

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) finds it is in the public interest to utilize FACs in connection with the duties of the FAA under law and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended, Pub. L 92-463, 5 U.S.C. App. 2.

The FACs will provide an open venue for developing consensus among diverse, competing interests on critical aviation modernization issues.  The FAA desires to establish a forum within which interested stakeholders can actively engage in constructively solving difficult challenges in air transportation system modernization.  More specifically, this engagement will strengthen the FAAs ability to establish:

 Performance standards that serve as a basis for certification and help expand the competitive market for aircraft equipment and avionics
 Consensus recommendations on policy, operational and investment decisions requested by the government and the associated performance metrics critical to maintaining a safe, secure and efficient air transportation system
 Recommendations and standards that help shape and harmonize the future of aviation

The FACs may also provide the FAA with recommendations that may be used for tactical and strategic planning purposes. 
To support the FAAs efforts toward this endeavor the contractor must provide administrative, clerical, facilitation, electronic publication and training support to the following three (3) FACS to be established by the FAA: 

 Drone Advisory Committee (DAC)
 NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC)
 Program Management Committee (PMC)

The Contractor must work in response to requests from the FAA to support the FACs development of comprehensive, industry-vetted and endorsed recommendations for the Federal government on issues ranging from technical performance standards to operational concepts for air transportation.  The Contractor must accomplish these objectives through the provision of logistical, operational and training support for Federal Advisory Committees and associated Subcommittees or Special Committees, as applicable.

For each Committee, Subcommittee or Special Committee the Contractor must provide the following Meeting Support:

Planning Support  The Contractor must assist the responsible Designated Federal Officer (DFO) in the establishment of potential dates, locations, venues and topics for envisioned plenary meetings.  Committee members must submit proposed agenda items with approximate duration to the relevant Committee Chair at least 45 days prior to the scheduled date of a meeting.  The Committee Chair, in consultation with the DFO and assisted by the Contractor, will refine the scheduled duration of the meeting, promulgate the draft meeting agenda to Committee members for their input, and collect that input to develop a final agenda.   The Contractor must assist the DFO to finalize meeting topics and support members in the development of high-level presentation concepts  including any required follow-up from previous meetings.

Coordination Support  Prior to meetings, the Contractor must assist the DFO with finalizing meeting dates, locations, venues and agendas.  The DFO must approve all meeting agendas; once approved the Contractor must notify members and assist the DFOs and/or members with drafting presentations, recommendation reports, guidance reports and other technical documents for advisory committee meetings.  The Contractor must submit draft Federal Registry Notices (FRN) for applicable meetings to FAA points of contact (POC) at least 30 days before meetings.  Once FAA POCs submit FRNs for electronic publication on the Federal Register web site managed by the Department of Archives, the Contractor must assist members with attendance preparation and ensure that Committee members receive all information needed to prepare for meetings at least fifteen (15) calendar days prior to the meeting. The Contractor must also coordinate all necessary meeting logistics including management of/coordination with presenters, facilitation of technology to conduct webcast, video conference or teleconference when required.

Facilitation Support  During meetings, the Contractor must provide broad logistics and facilitation.  This includes setup of venue, coordination with host, escorting attendees (if necessary), provision of technology to conduct webcast, video conference or teleconference (when required), and provision of presentation capability and hard-copy printouts.  The Contractor must collect minutes of each meeting unless (otherwise directed) and collect recommendations and findings for subsequent publication.  The Contractor must also collect and manage records of the members of each committee, subcommittee and working/tasking group with names, representations, occupations, start dates, end dates (if applicable).

Documentation Support  After meetings, the Contractor must publish and distribute meeting minutes and presentations/documents used at meetings on a publicly accessible website.  The Contractor must support resolution of comments by committee members, publication of recommendations and findings documents, meeting summaries and related information based on information collected at meetings and make such documents available after approval to both members and the public via a publicly accessible website.  The Contractor must further provide members of the public with access to Advisory Committee documents undergoing final review and must provide the capability for members of the public to submit comments on such documents.

Interested vendors should submit responses limited to 10 pages in total to address the requirements listed above.  Each vendor should include a capability statement identifying their relevant experience in performing the activities in the SOW and their programmatic approach to responding to this requirement.

The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address
<p>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, Office of Acquisitions, 9609 Medical Center Drive, Room 1E134, Bethesda, MD 20892, UNITED STATES</p>
<p>Description <br />The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch (ETIB) plans to procure on a sole source basis a Clinical-Grade Gamma-Retrovirus Vector Encoding an Anti-CD319 Chimeric Antigen Receptor with Cincinnati Children's Hospital, 3333 Burnet Av. S11.400, Cincinnati, OH 45229.</p>
<p>This acquisition will be processed in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures as authorized by FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) (1) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR part 6. The North American Industry Classification System Code is 622110 and the business size standard is $38.5 million.</p>
<p>Only one award will be made as a result of this solicitation. This will be awarded as a firm fixed price type contract.</p>
<p>It has been determined there are no opportunities to acquire green products or services for this procurement.</p>
<p>The Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch is dedicated to coordinated efforts in basic, preclinical and clinical investigations in the areas of immunotherapy, immune reconstitution, T cell biology, hematopoiesis, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The goal is to generate information from basic and preclinical investigations to develop new, curative hematopoietic stem cell transplant-based therapies for cancer. Information from new treatment protocols (including novel endpoints generated in the course of basic/preclinical research) is used to generate new questions and studies in the basic and preclinical research efforts. The branch emphasizes excellence in these endeavors and acts to maximize strengths present in the community at large by vigorous intramural and extramural interactions and collaborations.</p>
<p>Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are fusion proteins containing antigen-recognition domains and T-cell activation domains. When T cells are genetically modified to express CARs, they gain the ability to specifically recognize an antigen and to kill cells expressing the antigen. In previous clinical trials, CAR-expressing T cells have been shown to have potent anti-malignancy activity against leukemia and lymphoma. In particular, CARs targeting CD19 have been shown to be effective in multiple clinical trials, but extension of CAR T-cell therapies to other malignancies has not yet been widespread. The NCI has constructed a CAR targeting CD319. This CAR is encoded by a gamma-retroviral vector. The NCI plans to use this transiently-produced gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vector to genetically modify T cells from patients with multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma cells express CD319. The NCI will use the T cells genetically modified to express the anti-CD319 CAR to treat patients with multiple myeloma.</p>
<p>The vector will encode a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) recognizing a multiple myeloma antigen. The intended use of this vector is to transduce patient T cells. These T cells will be administered as a treatment for multiple myeloma in a clinical trial. The vector will be gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) pseudotyped. The vector will be generated in 293T cells. The NCI will provide a plasmid encoding the CAR also known as the expression construct. This requirement includes full testing of the vector to satisfy requirements for clinical use including testing for replication-competent retroviruses (RCR), testing for mycoplasma, syroplasma, endotoxin, adventitious virus, residual plasmid DNA, residual cellular DNA, transfer of E1A sequences, transfer of SV40 sequences, and testing for bacterial sterility.</p>
<p>The produced vector must be able to transduce primary human T cells to a degree that at least 20% of primary human T cells will express the chimeric antigen receptor gene on the T-cell surface as measured by flow cytometry. Shipment of the gamma-retroviral vector from the site of production to a storage site is not included in this contract, but temporary storage of the vector for up to 6 months shall be included.</p>
<p>SCOPE</p>
<p>The NCI plans to conduct clinical trials of a novel anti-CD319 CAR encoded by the gamma-retroviral vector. This will require production of a clinical-grade gamma-retroviral vector. This work has potential to be an important advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma. New treatments are urgently needed by patients with multiple myeloma.</p>
<p>Production of 20 liters of clinical-grade gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vector for use in a clinical trial. This gene therapy vector will encode and anti-CD319 chimeric antigen receptor and be used to treat multiple myeloma. The Contractor will provide packaging plasmids. The Contractor shall provide documentation of vector test results for inclusion in applications to the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS/ AND PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p>Personnel shall have training and experience in production of clinical-grade, transiently-produced gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vectors.</p>
<p>Vector Production facility additional personnel include eight additional employees dedicated to vector manufacturing, three employees dedicated to cleanroom operations and quality control and three Quality Assurance personnel supporting the Translational Core Labs including the Vector Production Facility. The Quality Assurance personnel report through the Office of Research Compliance and Regulatory Affairs within the Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation.</p>
<p>The VPF is a Manufacturing Facility for the production of viral vectors in support of Clinical Trials in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).</p>
<p>The Contractor shall:<br />&bull; Contractor shall produce 20 liters of clinical-grade gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vector for use in a clinical trial<br />&bull; Contractor personnel shall have training and experience in production of clinical-grade, transiently-produced gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vectors<br />&bull; Contractor personnel shall be trained in cleanroom behavior and are required to participate in the gowning qualification program and are qualified by media fill prior to preparing any production<br />&bull; All raw materials used in manufacturing must be approved by the FDA for human use, or are used as part of an Investigational New Drug (IND) FDA approved protocol<br />&bull; Perform all aseptic manipulations inside ISO Class 5 Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) in the labs. All BSCs shall be equipped with a continuous particle monitoring system that is tied into the central alarm system.</p>
<p>This requirement is for a specific type of gene-therapy vector that is not available from any other known source than the Vector Production Facility of the Cincinnati Children's Hospital (CCH). The requirements are for a clinical-grade, transiently-produced gamma-retroviral gene-therapy vector. It must be emphasized that the vector for this project must be clinical-grade for use in a human clinical trial. It must be suitable for research conducted under an Investigational New Drug Application approved by the FDA. <br />This notice is not a request for competitive quotation.

1. Request for Quotations (RFQ # 140P8318Q0048). The National Park Service (NPS), North Cascades National Park Service Complex (NOCA) has a requirement and is requesting quotations for Herbicide Application (Weed Spraying). This Request for Quotations has been made available through electronic commerce to comply with the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(e)) and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 416). The NPS routinely posts RFQ's with expected value between $15,000 and $25,000 at the federal government point of entry. Although this action is expected to be below the threshold, it is posted to maximize opportunities for competition. The RFQ and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-97 / 01-24-2018; and is set aside for small businesses, NAICS Code 561730; Landscaping (Weed Control) Services Contractors, with a small business size standard of $7.5 million average annual gross receipts for the past three years. Any resulting contract will be subject to the Service Contract Labor Standards, Wage Determination # WD 15-5541 (Rev.-5), with latest posting at www.wdol.gov on 01/16/2018. The NPS is interested in establishing a firm fixed price requirements type contract for the 2018 year spraying and up to two option years at the discretion of the NPS, for a total not to exceed three years. The Government intends to make a Firm Fixed Price, Simplified Acquisition (FAR Part 13), Best Value Award to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The National Park Service (NPS) encourages the participation of disadvantaged and women-owned businesses.
2. Background: The work to be performed for this project is to apply herbicide on approximately 50 acres in North Cascades National Park, Stehekin, WA to control rush skeletonweed (Chondrilla juncea). The park's Invasive Non-native Plant Management Plan has identified the Stehekin Airstrip, Buckner Orchard, and several small satellite populations as a high priority for control because of the potential for spread to other areas of the park. Contractor will furnish all equipment, labor, operating supplies and incidentals necessary to safely apply herbicide using an ATV boom sprayer and in strict compliance with the herbicide label and Statement of Work (SOW) provided.
3. Location: The project work is located in the lower Stehekin Valley, in Lake Chelan National Recreation Area near Stehekin, Washington, 98852. Stehekin is a remote community located 50 miles from Chelan, Washington, at the north end of Lake Chelan. The Stehekin Valley is isolated; the roads do not connect with any highway system. Stehekin is accessible from Chelan only by boat or barge. Lodging and meal services are limited in Stehekin. 
Information about Stehekin (including maps, ferry and barge services and lodging) is available at www.stehekin.com and www.nps.gov/noca/planyourvisit/stehekin.htm.
Contractors are advised that barges run infrequently and if needed it is recommended that contractors verify scheduled runs and costs or cost of charter runs, with the barge company before submitting a quote.
Due to the remoteness of the site and logistics costs involved with transportation, lodging, meals etc., again interested quoters are advised to thoroughly research the site prior to submitting a quote!
Please view information in the attached solicitation documents: 1) Read this first [Sol_140P8318Q0048.pdf]; 2) [140P8318Q0048 Attach 01_SOW_Herbicide_Application.pdf] and 3) [140P8318Q0048 Attach 02_WD 15-5541.pdf] for RFQ specifications, detailed information & clauses and if interested provide quote as indicated.

<p>10 U.S.C. 2304(c) (1) - Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements, FAR 6.302-1(a)(2). OSI Maritime Systems Inc.. is the only responsible source capable of providing licenses and training. This purchase is not suitable for full and open competition and it is in the best interest of the Government to acquire this item using a noncompetitive purchase for the following reasons:<br />a. ECPINS has been selected by the LCAC 100 integrator as the Navigation Software in<br />the LCAC C4N navigation system. It is not cost effective to replace the LCAC 100<br />navigation system baseline as it will require a change to the LCAC 100 production<br />contract and will impact successful completion of acquisition milestones for the program in FY19. The cos&nbsp; of integrating any other brand of similar navigation system capabilities is estimated at $12,000,000.00 over the course of 36 months. b. The ECPINS software is proprietary to OSI Maritime Systems Ltd. They are the only<br />source for the software and associated training.</p>

<DESC>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers has a need for a construction contract for the construction of a reinforced concrete wall at three locations immediately downstream of the Unit 4 intake bulkhead at West Point Power House. Each wall is 12'-6" thick, 17' long, and 33' tall. The wall will be tied to the existing powerhouse structure with steel dowels and two water-stops will be installed to insure water tightness. Construction will be challenged by the physical location of these walls and bringing construction material into the project site. In order to access Unit 4 intake and redefine the workspace from confined to open, the contractor will have to remove two pre-stressed double Tee that are roughly 8 feet wide by 40 feet long. The contractor shall be responsible for removing the double Tees and the construction and subsequent removal of a temporary secondary means of egress. The existing overhead crane in the powerhouse will be available to move construction materials in and out of the Unit 4 cavity. The crane will be operated by government personnel. The contractor shall coordinate the need for the crane and associated logistics at least two days prior to the need with the powerhouse supervisor. Any powerhouse project or maintenance activity requiring the crane take precedence over the contractor's use of the crane and cannot be used as the basis of a claim.
<p>It is anticipated that a firm-fixed price contract will be awarded based on FAR Part 15 "best value" procedures. This procurement is eligible to 8(a) firms having a bona fide office located in Region IV; including Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Kentucky, North Carolina and Tennessee Only. Joint Ventures are allowable on competitive 8(a) set-asides; however, the joint venture agreement package or email notifications of bid submittal by the joint venture must be received by SBA prior to proposal due date and the Joint venture agreement must be approved before award of any resulting contract. If you are contemplating a joint venture on this project, you must advise your assigned SBA Business Opportunity Specialist (BOS) as soon as possible. It is also recommended that the agreement be submitted as soon as practicable to ensure compliance with established regulations.</p>
<p>The construction duration is set from 1 year after notice to proceed is issued. A site visit/proposal conference will be held at a predetermined date at the project site. All questions regarding the solicitation will be facilitated utilizing the ProjNet automated database. The solicitation package will be available for download on or about May 14, 2018. The solicitation will only be issued as a direct download at the following website: https://www.fbo.gov. All offerors must be registered in Systems for Award Management (SAM) before they will be allowed to download solicitation information. The solicitation will not be provided in a printed paper format, however, the Government reserves the right to revert to paper medium when it is determined to be in the Government's best interest. Therefore, it is the offeror's responsibility to check the website for solicitation posting and any changes to this solicitation. Those registering are responsible for the accuracy of the information provided.</p>

<DESC>Arlington National Cemetery Administration Building Renovation<br />Located on Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, VA<br />Construction estimate $5-$8 M
<p>Contract Type: Firm-Fixed Price<br />Best Value Trade Off is the anticipated acquisition approach<br />Competition will be restricted to Small Business Set-aside</p>
<p>This is a pre-solicitation notice. This is NOT a solicitation. Do NOT submit proposals or questions in response to this notice.</p>
<p>The Administration Building is considered the "heart and brains" of the Arlington National Cemetery because the staff who plan, coordinate, and participate in the funeral services work in this building and most of the mourners coming to funerals gather in this building. The Administration Building was designed by the Mills-Petticord Partnership, and completed in 1976. It is approximately 10,455 square feet/floor, two stories and the roof is approximately 11,236sf. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Norfolk District, has a requirement to update, repair, and refurbish the Administration Building to accommodate staff and funeral attendees needs in a code compliant building: some of the spaces will be reconfigured to accommodate current needs, asbestos abatement is needed, some spaces will be updated and code compliance of some elements is needed. Most of the work will be on the interior. Some work is needed on the exterior cladding, roof, and exterior steps. Currently, the building has no fire protection elements; this deficiency will be corrected. The Administration Building is an International Style building that contributes to ANC's National Register Historic District. The salient characteristics such as the natural wood finish trim work, use of book matched paneling, and use of natural light, will be preserved while the building is updated. A report concerning the architectural character identifying the visual aspects of the building has been done and should be used as a reference during this project. A technical assessment of the building was also done in 2015-16 and will be used as a reference for this project.</p>
<p>The Administration Building is critical to the interment process at the cemetery. Many funeral participants meet in one of the three family rooms or the lobby. However, after 40 years of use, the building does have some areas that need to be repaired and updated so that the building can fully serve the users. Repairs to the building envelop will increase energy efficiency, stop some minor leaks, and prolong the life of the building. While the building appears to be accessible to people with special needs, many of its features do not comply with current regulations for accommodation. Updating some features will help visitors and staff with special needs. Many of the finishes and the lighting are original to the building and need to be replaced, cleaned, or updated for better energy efficiency, a more appropriate appearance or function, and to keep the building in good repair. Asbestos containing ceiling have interfered with updating the HVAC system. To address the existing thermal comfort issues, sound transmission issues, many of the asbestos containing ceilings will need to be removed and replaced.</p>
<p>During the renovation of the building, the functions and staff that normally reside in this building will be housed in a number of temporary buildings adjacent to this site. Deliberate, prompt progress on this project is needed to minimize inconvenience to the staff and mourners.</p>
<p>The Government intends to award a construction contract to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation, is determined fair and reasonable, and offers the best overall value to the Government as determined through a best value trade off process in accordance with FAR Part 15 procedures, "Contracting by Negotiation".</p>
<p>A) Project Approach: The Government intends to evaluate the offeror's understanding of on construction, management, and risk management. Some elements include but not limited to quality, schedule/timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction, management/personnel/labor, cost/financial management, and safety/security. <br />B) Specialized Experience: The Government intends to evaluate three (3) example projects of the offeror as a prime contractor that best demonstrate experience that is "similar in type/scope" and "similar in complexity" on recent and relevant projects,<br />C) Past Performance: The Government intends to evaluate each Offeror's past performance for the three (3) most recent projects submitted under specialized experience.<br />D) Cost/Price: Supplemental Price Breakdown. The Government requests a price breakdown as backup to the pricing provided in the CLIN Schedule.</p>
<p>The solicitation and accompanying documents will be issued electronically and will be uploaded to the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website (https://www.fbo.gov) on or about 27 May 2018. Telephone calls or written requests for the solicitation package will NOT be accepted. Prospective Proposers are responsible for monitoring FBO to respond to the solicitation and any amendments or other information regarding this acquisition. Prospective Proposers must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) in order to be eligible for award. It is highly encourage to update your Small Business Profile as well.</p>

<p>2. PROJECT INFORMATION: NWS expects this contract to support General Investigation (GI) studies (planning), engineering and design at operating projects (safety and maintenance/repair-related projects), and specialty support during construction at civil works operating projects. Examples of the water resource-related project types and work to be performed under this A-E services acquisition include:</p>
<p>&bull; Infrastructure repair, renovation, or improvements for existing operating projects (project-level planning, engineering, and design of USACE operated and maintained hydro-electric dams, levees, and navigation locks)<br />&bull; Fish passage improvements (habitat enhancements, culverts, and ladders)<br />&bull; Flood control structures or flood control risk management (levee inspection, maintenance, and engineering and design; shoreline and bank erosion control and stabilization; flood control repair, rehabilitation, and construction) <br />&bull; Ecosystem restoration (studies, engineering, and design for work such as wetlands mitigation, rehabilitation, and creation)<br />&bull; Water supply, delivery, and treatment; storm/sewer systems (planning, engineering, and design for repair, renovation, and construction)</p>
<p>These are examples of complex, water resource-related projects that require a firm with experience managing similarly-complex projects. Additionally, the firm must have access to a multiple discipline team working together to execute the projects anticipated under this acquisition.</p>
<p>A-E services may be required for one or more project phases. The Civil Works program is requesting full service A-E capabilities within this acquisition, which will likely include architecture and landscaping; planning and economics; civil, mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and hydrologic engineering; geology and geotechnical engineering; and structural engineering. Typical significant, complex water resource-related civil works projects may require the following support provided by the proposed A-E contract:</p>
<p>&bull; Project Planning (plan formulation, economics and financial analyses, environmental studies and evaluations, public involvement and coordination, and real estate research and access support) <br />&bull; Engineering and Design (routine and specialty water-resources engineering analyses, design analysis, drawings, and specifications ranging from design definition through bid-ready construction contracting packages, cost estimating, value engineering)<br />&bull; Support Services during Construction (specialty submittal review, engineering inspections, requests for information, change order support).</p>
<p>3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this particular acquisition are listed below in descending order of importance. Criteria A through E are primary criteria. Criterion F and G are secondary and will only be used as a &lsquo;tie-breaker' among firms that are essentially technically equal. The secondary criterion will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation.</p>
<p>PRIMARY CRITERION (A) SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE of the Prime/JV firm in executing civil works projects for the NWS primary civil works mission areas of water resources management:</p>
<p>1. USACE Civil Works water resources-related projects including the following project types, in order of decreasing importance:<br />a. Infrastructure repair, renovation, or improvements for existing operating projects (hydro-electric dams, levees and navigation locks)<br />b. Fish passage improvements<br />c. Flood control structures or flood control risk management<br />d. Ecosystem restoration<br />e. Water supply, delivery, and treatment; storm/sewer systems</p>
<p>2. Planning (e.g., economics and financial analyses, environmental studies and evaluations, public involvement and coordination) of Civil Works water resources- related projects performed under the following USACE authorities (identify all that apply to each example project):<br />a. Continuing Authorities Program (Sections 14, 103, 107, 111, 204, 205, 206, 544, 1135);<br />b. Specifically Authorized Projects by Congress;<br />c. Flood Management Services (Section 206 of PL 86-645);<br />d. Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), including Section 203 - Tribal Partnership Program; Section 544 authorizations for the Puget Sound and Adjacent Waters Restoration Program, and Section 595 environmental infrastructure, resource protection, and development;<br />e. Ecosystem Restoration Authorities (Section 204, 206, 1135); and/or<br />f. Estuary Habitat Restoration Act.</p>
<p>3. Engineering and Design (e.g., water-resources engineering studies, feasibility, design analysis, drawings and specifications, bid documents) of USACE Civil Works projects requiring one or more phases of A-E services:<br />a. Engineering and Design studies, feasibility, and analysis;<br />b. Engineering and Design for bid-ready construction contracting packages.</p>
<p>Additional considerations:<br />&bull; Projects in which the Prime/JV and its team subconsultants demonstrated prior project experience working together in significant prime/subconsultant roles may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria.</p>
<p>&bull; Completed USACE water resources-related Civil Works projects may be evaluated more favorably; water resources-related projects for others, with similar requirements to the range of civil works projects described above, may be submitted as experience, but will not be evaluated more favorably.</p>
<p>&bull; Completed projects performed within the NWS civil works boundaries may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria.</p>
<p>&bull; Projects that included A-E Support Services during Construction (e.g., specialty submittal review, engineering inspections, requests for information, change order support) may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria.</p>
<p>Firms will be evaluated for experience and competence. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in the SF330, emphasizing Sections F, G, and H of the SF330.</p>
<p>A maximum of ten (10) projects completed by the Prime/JV no more than 10 years prior to submission shall be shown in Section F. Projects that are completed no more than five (5) years prior to the specified submission date will be given additional consideration.</p>
<p>For the up to ten projects submitted in Section F of the SF 330, a "project" is defined as work performed at one site or at a single operating site (dam, etc.). An Indefinite Delivery Contract (IDC) is not a project. A project may contain multiple task orders or contracts if they are for multiple phases of the project at the same site. Project descriptions shall clearly state the extent of work performed by the Prime/JV and team, extent of work completed, and dates of completion.</p>
<p>If the offeror provides a specific task order as its "project," it shall provide the base contract number(s) and the task order number(s) for reference purposes. If the offeror provides a site-specific contract as its "project," it shall provide the contract number for reference purposes. If the offeror provides more than 10 example projects, only the first 10 examples will be evaluated.</p>
<p>A completed project is defined as one in which the firm's performance of the work for which it was hired is complete.</p>
<p><br />PRIMARY CRITERION (B) PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS of the Prime/JV's staff and team consultants to be assigned to this contract. The education, training, professional registration, proposed job title, and overall relevant experience of key personnel will be considered.</p>
<p>This criterion is primarily concerned with the qualifications of the key personnel identified by the A-E and not the number of personnel, which is addressed under Criterion D - Capacity. The key personnel employed by the Prime/JV may be evaluated more favorably for this criteria.</p>
<p>Responding firms should demonstrate the professional qualifications of their staff in key disciplines:</p>
<p>1. Key professional disciplines are identified below by function code (fc):<br />- Descriptions by fc correspond to "List of Disciplines (Function Codes)" in the SF330 Instructions; where a fc does not exist, the requirement is described by the Government.<br />- Identify key personnel proposed by fc in Sections E, G, and H of the SF330.<br />- List professional registrations or certifications, if applicable, for the key disciplines.</p>
<p>2. Submit resumes in Section E of the SF330 for each of the disciplines below, which are listed in descending order of importance.<br />1. Project Manager (SF330 fc 48; licensed or registered professional required);<br />2. Quality Control Manager (no fc; licensed or registered professional required; resume must identify QC role(s) in past projects, qualifications);<br />3. Economist (fc 20; master's degree preferred, but not required; civil works- related experience is required);<br />4. Planner, Urban/Regional (fc 47; master's degree preferred, but not required; civil works-related planner experience is required);<br />5. Civil Engineer (fc 12; professional engineer (PE) required);<br />6. Hydraulic Engineer (fc 32; PE required);<br />7. Hydrologist (fc 34; licensed or registered professional required; additional certification [e.g., American Institute of Hydrology] is preferred, but not required);<br />8. Mechanical Engineer (fc 42; PE required);<br />9. Electrical Engineer (fc 21; PE required);<br />10. Cost Engineers (fc 18; nationally recognized cost engineering certification [e.g., AACEI CCP or CEP] or PE, project experience in use of MCASES MII software required).</p>
<p>&bull; Responses must be coordinated with function code responses with Part II, subpart 9, "Employees by Discipline".</p>
<p>&bull; If multiple resumes are provided for Criterion B, identify the single most highly qualified individual proposed for each key discipline for evaluation. The additional resumes for the required disciplines or for disciplines that are not listed in this criterion will not be evaluated.</p>
<p>The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Sections E, G, and H of the SF330.</p>
<p><br />PRIMARY CRITERION (C) PAST PERFORMANCE on DoD and other contracts with respect to cost control, quality of work, management/business relations, and compliance with performance schedules. CPARS is the primary source of information on past performance. CPARS will be queried for all firms submitting an SF330. Each project in Section F of the SF330 shall include project owner's contact information. If deemed appropriate by the Selection Board (Board), performance evaluations for significant team subcontractors will also be considered. The Board may seek information on past performance from other sources.</p>
<p>The Board will first consider the relevancy of each performance evaluation on A-E services contracts to the proposed contract, including the type of work, contractor's performing office, age of the evaluation, and whether subsequent evaluations indicate a change in a firm's performance. Past performance ratings for unique civil works-related projects of similar size, scope, and complexity to those anticipated for the NWS mission areas are considered more relevant. The board will then rate the confidence in the firm based on the ratings of its past performance, with an emphasis on quality of work, cost control, and compliance with performance schedules, and the extent to which past projects were performed by proposed key personnel. The end result will be a combined relevancy/confidence rating (e.g., Relevant/Substantial Confidence).</p>
<p>Where no recent/relevant performance record is available or the offeror's performance record is so sparse that no meaningful confidence assessment rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on the factor of past performance.</p>
<p><br />PRIMARY CRITERION (D) CAPACITY of key disciplines. The board will consider available capacity of key disciplines identified above in Criterion B of the Prime/JV and its team consultants to perform work in the required time. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H and Part II of the SF330. Function code (fc) and descriptions must correspond to "List of Disciplines (Function Codes)" in the SF330 Instructions.</p>
<p>Where a function code does not exist, the requirement is described by the Government. Responses must be coordinated with Part II, subpart 9, "Employees by Discipline".</p>
<p>The offeror is required to provide a table summary of the number of personnel for each<br />key discipline, with separate columns for (1) Prime/JV capacity, (2) team subconsultants capacity, and (3) total team capacity for each key discipline in Section H of the SF330. Capacity will be measured by number of personnel, not percentages or availability.</p>
<p>Each key discipline required in the response shall be shown in and coordinated with Part II of the SF330, which requires that each individual employed by the firm be identified by one function code. Part II will be evaluated to determine if the function code capacity and claimed numbers of personnel support the information in Section H.</p>
<p><br />PRIMARY CRITERION (E) Knowledge of the Locality The board will evaluate the Prime/JV and team's demonstrated knowledge and experience with (1) local climate conditions, (2) geological features, and (3) the state/ local regulatory agencies within WA, ID, and MT (NWS civil works area of responsibility). The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF330.</p>
<p><br />The following secondary criteria will only be used as a tie-breaker among technically equal, most highly qualified firms. The secondary criteria will not be co-mingled with the primary criteria in the evaluation. The three secondary selection criteria are listed below in order of descending importance (higher level criterion will be evaluated first, and others considered only if required).</p>
<p>SECONDARY CRITERION (F) EXTENT OF SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION measured as a percentage of the total estimated effort.</p>
<p>Small Business Participation includes the following:<br />1. Small Business<br />2. Small Disadvantaged Business<br />3. Women-Owned Small Business<br />4. HUBZone Small Business<br />5. Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business<br />6. Veteran-Owned Small Business</p>
<p><br />SECONDARY CRITERION (G) VOLUME OF DoD A-E CONTRACT AWARDS Responding firms shall cite all contract numbers, task orders and modifications, award dates, and total negotiated fees for any DoD A-E contract(s) awarded within the past twelve (12) months. This information will assist in effecting an equitable distribution of DoD A-E contracts among qualified firms, including SB and SDB. The basis of the evaluation will be the information in Section H of the SF330.</p>
<p><br />4. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Interested firms having the capabilities to perform this work must submit one (1) original plus three (3) copies and one (1) CD or DVD with searchable Adobe PDF files of one SF330 (08/2016 edition, unless otherwise indicated) for the Prime firm that includes all team consultants.</p>
<p>Include the firm's DUNS number and CAGE codes in the SF330, Part I, Sections B and C.</p>
<p>Firms should include information regarding the Secondary Selection Criteria in Section H of the SF330. The SF330 shall have a total page limitation of 80 printed pages with Section H limited to fifteen (15) pages, and Part II is excluded from the 80 printed page limit. Double-sided sheets will count as two pages. Page sheets of 11 inches X 17 inches will be counted as two (2) pages if printed on one side, and four (4) pages if printed on both sides. For all SF330 sections, use no smaller than 10 pt. font.</p>

<SUBJECT>Carmen Levee Rehabilitation
<SOLNBR>W912EF18B0021
<CONTACT>Julie Morris, Phone 5095277227, Email Julie.M.Morris@usace.army.mil
<DESC>Construction project entitled: Carmen Levee Rehabilitation.  The construction will occur on the Salmon River Carmen Levee near Salmon, Idaho.  Construction magnitude is estimated to be between $250,000 and $500,000.  100% performance and payment bonds will be required.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this project is 237990 and the associated small business size standard is $36,500,000.  Solicitation is open to women-owned small business concerns.
<p>Summary of Scope of Work:</p>
<p>The site consists of one location on the levee approximately three miles to the north of the City of Salmon, Idaho.  The southern end of the site is located to the immediate north of the Highway 93 Bridge near the entrance to the county fairgrounds.  The levee extends to the north past several residences on the east side of the Salmon River.  The repair should begin at the most upstream scour area and end at the furthest downstream area, which is approximately 700 feet on the right bank of the river.  There are several areas where the riprap is in good condition and can be reused.  Construction requires restoring the levee to the as-was condition by re-constructing portions of the levee that eroded away and replacing the armoring on the riverward side.  The levee is accessible at several points by local and residential roads.<br /> <br />Riprap on slopes and toes eroded away during spring 2017 high flows. This has caused the slopes to become steeper than 2H:1V, which are unstable for riprap. Some riprap remains, but does not constitute a competent revetment surface. This displaced riprap has exposed the levee shell material underneath which needs to be protected with quarry spalls before riprap placement. The contractor will cover fill material and exposed levee fill with one foot of quarry spalls and then riprap (2-4' diameter). The volume of quarry spalls and fill is 414 cubic yards and riprap placement 1,892 cubic yards.</p>
<p>Riprap will be hauled from a local pit, approximately 15-20 miles away, by the contractor.  River depth varies throughout this reach.  Some sites could be 10 to 15 feet deep at the toe of riprap placement.  The estimated period of performance is July 2018 - August 2018.</p>
<p>All on-site work shall be performed in accordance with the Corps of Engineers Safety and Health Requirements Manual (EM 385-1-1).<br /> <br />Establish and manage an effective on-site Safety and Health program in accordance with EM 385-1-1 that will require the development and submission of a comprehensive project specific Accident Prevention Plan for Government acceptance. In addition, develop and submit for Government acceptance Activity Hazard Analyses for each phase of work and a project specific Fall Protection Plan that comply with EM 385-1-1.</p>
<p>A Site Safety and Health Officer (SSHO) employed by the prime contractor is required for each shift of the contractor's on-site operations. The SSHO shall possess a minimum of 5-years' experience in construction safety on similar projects, shall have completed the 30-Hour OSHA Construction Safety training within the last 5 years, and shall have completed at least 8 hours of safety training from accredited safety training sources each year for the past 5 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contractor will be responsible for establishing and managing an effective Contractor Quality Control (CQC) System that will require the development and submission of a comprehensive project specific CQC Plan for Government acceptance.  A CQC System Manager employed by the prime contractor shall be required to be on-site for each shift of the contractor's operations.  The CQC System Manager must possess a minimum of five years relevant experience in a supervisory or management position such as Quality Control Manager, Quality Assurance Manager, or Construction Manager directly involved in the management of construction quality at the project site.  In addition, the CQC System Manager shall have completed the course entitled "Construction Quality Management for Contractors" within the last five years.     <br /> <br />The contractor will be required to use the Government-furnished Construction Contractor Module (referred to as QCS) of the Resident Management System (RMS) to record, maintain, and submit various information throughout the contract period.  QCS is a Windows-based program that can be run on a stand-alone personal computer or on a network.  The Government will make the QCS software available to the contractor after contract award.</p>
<p>The project will involve the development and management of contractor furnished submittals for items such as pre-construction plans, product data, test reports, and contract close-out documentation as required by the technical specifications of the contract.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous work within the project includes the delivery of As-Built Drawings and Operations &amp; Maintenance manuals to the customer.</p>
<p>Solicitation Number W912EF-18-B-0021 will be posted to the FBO.gov in approximately 2-3 weeks. The solicitation is an Invitation for Bid.  Bids will be due no sooner than 30 calendar days after actual solicitation issuance date.
