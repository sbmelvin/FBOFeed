<CONTACT>JEFF CARAVELLI CONTRACTING OFFICER 9162789341     jcaravelli@usgs.gov;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Biological Resources Discipline, Western Ecological Research Center (WERC) has a recurring need for transmitters, both radio frequency and satellite, for use in wildlife telemetry research.  At this time, the WERC is interested in transmitters appropriate for use with birds, reptiles, and mammals; transmitters appropriate for use with fish are not required. The Government intends to establish one or more Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts with responsible supplier(s), each with an ordering period of five (5) years.  During this ordering period, when a requirement is identified, the Government will have the option to place an order with the contract holder without the need for further competition or public notification.  This will greatly simplify and expedite the process of acquiring these transmitters, and will ensure that the WERC's science mission is accomplished.  To solicit, the Government will release a list of the transmitters, by brand and model number, that have been repeatedly purchased in the past and for which there is anticipated to be a continuing and recurring need.  Any interested and qualified prospective contractor may propose to supply these items or their functional equivalents (brand name or equivalent specification).  For each required type of transmitter, the Government will select the single contractor that provides the best value over the ordering period of five years.  This process may result in the issuance of one contract, or several.  In the case of several contracts, when the Government identifies the need for a specific type of transmitter, an order will be placed with the contract holder without public notification or notification of any other contract holders.  In this way, this is not a "multiple award" situation as described in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 16.504(c); rather, it is a situation better described as several single awards.   At this time, the Government anticipates including the products of four (4) companies on this list: Advanced Telemetry Systems, Inc. of Isanti, MN; Holohil Systems Ltd. of Ontario, Canada; Microwave Telemetry, Inc. of Columbia, MD; and Telonics, Inc. of Mesa, AZ.  This list is not necessarily complete; the Government reserves the right to include additional products in the solicitation.  As required by FAR 5.102(a), the forthcoming solicitation (number 05WRQQ0125), will be made available through the Governmentwide point of entry (GPE) at http://www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 20 June 2005.  To receive a copy of the solicitation directly, please notify the Contracting Officer of your interest in this acquisition by email at jcaravelli@usgs.gov.  Please note that this acquisition is conducted utilizing simplified acquisition procedures in accordance with FAR 13.5; any resulting solicitation will be issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).

<DESC>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has initiated a program to investigate detection technologies that will identify human stowaways in break-bulk air cargo and air cargo consolidation containers prior to the introduction of the cargo onto an aircraft.  The program may eventually lead to a formal test and evaluation of equipment with the potential for deployment.  However at this time, a market survey is being conducted to solicit relevant information from system developers with respect to technologies or detection devices that may be able to accomplish the screening mission. This Request for Information (RFI) is not considered a formal request for proposal.  The TSA does not plan on making an award or developing a source list based on responses to this RFI.  The TSA will not reimburse any preparation costs associated with responses to this RFI. The primary objective of the market survey is to develop a comparative listing of equipment/ technologies so that the TSA can assess the different options that are available for mitigating the risk of a human stowaway from boarding an aircraft.  To maximize the utility of the listing, the TSA is requesting that system developers furnish the following information in their response: 1.	Company/Organization Name 2.	Point of Contact Data (Phone/FAX/email/Address) 3.	Human Signature Detected 4.	Technology Description 5.	Photographs/Drawings/Illustrations 6.	Concept of Operations 7.	False Alarm Considerations

<DESC>Description

The Office of Policy and Research of the Employee Benefits Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor solicits a proposal for research projects focused on private employment-based health and pension benefits and plans, and related public policy issues.  For consideration, projects shall propose a budget of $25,000 or less, and a performance period of 12 months or less.  This is an unrestrictive solicitation.  The NAICS Code for this acquisition is 541720.  Proposals shall describe new research that would be undertaken, and not work currently funded or completed.  Proposals will be evaluated on the basis of: policy relevance, study design and implementation, work plan and schedule of deliverables, qualifications and past performance of primary researcher, and proposed cost.  Offerors should be alert for any BAA amendments that may permit extensions to the proposal submission date or that may otherwise modify this announcement.  Proposals received after Thursday, June 30, 2005, will not be considered under this solicitation.   Proposals shall be written.  Orders awarded will be firm-fixed price.


Introduction

Landmark employee benefits legislation enacted in 1974 gave the Federal government primary responsibility for protecting the rights of workers covered by private employee benefit plans.  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) of 1974 places oversight responsibilities at the Department of Labor (DOL) in the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA).  Section 513 of Title I of ERISA directs and authorizes the Secretary of Labor to undertake research on employee benefit plans.  


Statement of Work

EBSA solicits proposals for research projects focused on private employment-based health and pension benefits and plans, and related public policy issues, with a performance period of 12 months or less.    The funds made available with the solicitation could fund work conducted by the primary researcher or support research assistance related to the primary researcher’s project.  Proposals shall describe new research that would be undertaken, and not work currently funded or completed.  Projects shall not involve primary data collection.  

Employee benefits policy issues and research projects of particular interest would include, although not exhaustively:

1.	Employers’ and workers’ access to affordable health benefits coverage, and the nature and quality of such coverage, including the effects of:

•	Health insurance market structure and regulation, including proposals for new purchasing arrangements;
•	Tax preferences for health insurance purchased in group and individual markets;
•	Health savings accounts; and
•	Consumer-driven choices of health plans or providers.

2.	Workers’ strategies to ensure retirement security, including the causes and effects of:

•	Individual account participant contributions, investments and distributions (e.g., lump-sum or annuitized payments), and the role of professional financial advice, investment education and other techniques to improve participation rates (e.g., automatic enrollment);
•	Proliferation of hybrid and other non-traditional pension plan designs (e.g., cash balance plans); 
•	Competing saving or asset accumulation priorities, e.g., retirement income needs and healthcare costs, education costs;
•	Transitional employment or phased retirement; and
•	Management of longevity risk.

3.	Determinants of employers’ decision to offer, amend or terminate employee health and pension plans, including:

•	Applicable federal laws and regulations, including recent and proposed changes to such laws and regulations;
•	Recent and proposed changes to Medicare and Social Security programs;
•	Demographic and economic trends, including labor, capital and healthcare market trends;
•	Healthcare cost increases, drivers and control efforts;
•	Pension plan financial risks, including strategies for management; and
•	Role of global competition.

4.	Developments in financial markets and instruments and corporate finance, and the implications for defined contribution accounts and defined benefit funds, including issues related to:

Employee benefits research projects could be based on population or employer (i.e., plan-sponsor) databases.  Frequently applied secondary databases of both types are briefly described below:

Population Databases.  Several federally funded household surveys are used to study employee benefits.  Relevant surveys include:  employee benefit modules of the Survey on Income and Program Participation (SIPP); employee benefit supplements to the Current Population Survey (CPS); the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Household Component (MEPS-HC); the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF); the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS); and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).  The 1996 SIPP included two employee benefit modules:  a module on employment-based health coverage conducted in 1997 and released in May 2001; and a module on pension coverage status of workers and pension benefit amounts paid to retirees, which was conducted in 1998 and released in early 2002.  An employer-provided health benefits module fielded in 2002 as part of the 2001 SIPP became available late in 2003.  Supplements to the CPS that provide employee benefit information include the April 1993 supplement, the September 1994 supplement, the contingent worker supplements fielded in February of 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001, and the annual March income supplement.  The contingent worker supplement to the CPS was not fielded in February 2003.  (The Appendix describes how to obtain further information on these surveys.)

Employer Databases.  Some projects lend themselves to investigation with the use of employer or plan-sponsor databases.  The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey - Insurance Component (MEPS-IC) collects information on employer-sponsored health plans.  Form 5500 Annual Report files, which are jointly produced by Treasury, PBGC and EBSA, are publicly available.  Employer studies might also rely on proprietary data collected from a group of employers (or intermediaries) sharing characteristics of interest.  If confidentiality with respect to the identity of these employers is required, assurances of appropriate protection measures shall be provided at the time of submission of the proposal.  (The Appendix also describes how to obtain further information on Form 5500 files.)


Evaluation.  The following criteria and weights will be used for scoring the proposals: 

Policy relevance							 	
Study design and implementation					 
Work plan and schedule of deliverables				 
Qualifications of primary researcher					 
Past Performance
	Proposed Cost

<CONTACT>Maria Blair, 405-954-7883
<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Radar Product Division, (RPD), has a requirement for 51 each of a Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) Elevation Drive Bearing Enhancement.  The device must perform both as a bearing, with certain specifications relating to that function, and also as a bull gear, which has its own unique specification requirements.  The fabrication processes applied to the two parts of the bearing need to be complimentary and comopatible in order for both the bearing and the bull gear requirements to be met satisfactorily. Titan Systems Corporation, Datron Advanced Technologies Division, located in Simi Valley, CA, is the manufacturer of the TDWR pedestal, including the antenna mounting yokes, the elevation housing, and the elevation bearings that connect those assemblies together.  Titan Datron built the gearboxes, antenna mounting yoke, and the elevation housing, and it alone possesses the drawing that fully specify these interfaces with the elevation bearings, e.g., the torque load and the flatness of the machined mounting surfaces.  Titan Datron conformance with the constraints caused by form, fit, and function requirements of the drive bearing is paramount to the ability of the bearing to perform its required bearing and bull gear functions for 20 years, which is its specified life. Titan Systems Corporation, Datron Advanced Technologies Division is the only known source since they are the manufacturer of the gearboxes manufactured to their drawings and specifications.  The specification drawing includes requirements for testing, inspection, quality control, and certification of materials for the TDWR's elevation drive bearings.  These elements are critical to achieving the high American Gear Manufacturer's Association quality code that will be required of the new gears.  That quality code compliance, along with surface smoothness as specified in the Titan Datron drawing are the key improvements of this specification set that will contribute to longer gear life.

<DESC>This Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) solicits offers for the award of procurement contracts for innovative, high-risk, non-traditional Geospatial Intelligence concepts, technologies and products with a potential for high-payoff.  These contracts are hereafter described as the  “Innovation Program.”  
The NGA expects to award up to $1 million in procurement contracts for innovative, cutting edge Geospatial Intelligence concepts, technologies and products.  It is anticipated that there will be one contract awarded for $1,000,000.   Based on the quality of proposals, there is a potential for awarding two contracts for $500,000 each. It is important for researchers to find opportunities for collaboration to address all aspects of this proposal.  The awardee(s) will be announced during the Geospatial Intelligence Symposium 2005 to be held on October 30-November 2, 2005, in San Antonio, Texas. The United States Geospatial Intelligence Foundation hosts this Symposium.  
The Innovation BAA is requesting innovative research that will focus on enabling the processing, analysis and dissemination of enormous amounts of newly collected data each day from multiple sources.  Enormous amounts of data may come from numerous sources and in several formats – text, image, video, digital maps, audio, etc. To help analysts make efficient use of their time, NGA needs automated processes that can identify and organize contextually relevant types of data. The overall intent is to allow analysts to spend less time dealing with systems and more time analyzing data.  
The Innovation Program is seeking innovative approaches to improve automated filtering of data for our analysts to help mitigate challenges associated with information volume, variety and velocity.  Awardees will be expected to deliver Proof of Concept demonstrations, containing only unclassified data that can be installed from CD in a generic Windows environment approximately one year after GeoInt 2006.  
Research proposals should address automated triage of information and data combined with an intuitive human-computer interface to facilitate the analysis process.  To address the many aspects of these areas, NGA highly encourages collaboration between researchers and commercial entities.  The full solicitation will be posted approximately 15 days following the original posting of this presolicitation.                                             The Primary Point of Contact will be:                      Jonathan Mostowski, Contract Specialist, Phone 703-735-3900, Fax 703-735-3965, E-mail mostowsj@nga.mil.

The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ‘more than 50 percent’ for ‘at least 80 percent’ each place it appears.

A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1) The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section.

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the sam relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.

<DESC>On behalf of the Marine Corps Systems Command (MCSC), Infantry Weapons Systems (IWS), Optics and Non-Lethal Systems (ONS) this notice announces a forthcoming  procurement for the MOUNTS for the Scout Sniper Day Scope for the M82A3 rifle. The Government intends to award a single Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract (DPAS rated DO-A5) to the successful offeror representing the best value to the Government. The Government intends to award prior to 30 Sep 05. The provisions at FAR Part 52.212-1 Instructions to Offerors – Commercial Items apply to this acquisition.  All future information relative to this procurement will be available to industry through the FedBizOpps and NECO websites. Offerors will be required to submit separate technical and business proposals and should anticipate providing bid samples with their proposal for the SSDS MOUNTS.  The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR Part 52.212-2, Evaluation-Com! mercial Items.  MINIMUM / MAXIMUM PURCHASES: The minimum purchase for the M82A3 SSDS MOUNTS is 100 units.  The maximum purchase for the M82A3 SSDS MOUNTS is 7,500 units. This contract shall be in effect for five years from the date of award.   EVALUATION: In making its final “best value” determination, the Government intends to consider the following non-cost/price factors, in order of descending importance (from most to least important):  (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance.  (For the purpose of this source selection, the evaluation of “quality” as a factor is considered to be inherent in Technical Capability and Past Performance). The factors listed above, when combined, are significantly more important than price; however, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination increases with the degree of equality in the overall technical merit of the proposals.  As such, price will be evaluated, but not rated. Offerors should read the terms and conditions of the solicitation (once posted) carefully and refer any questions to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).

The Government will evaluate proposals in accordance with FAR Part 52.212-2, Evaluation-Com! mercial Items.  MINIMUM / MAXIMUM PURCHASES: The minimum purchase for the M40A3 SSDS MOUNTS is 600 units.  The maximum purchase for the M40A3 SSDS MOUNTS is 10,000 units.  This contract shall be in effect for five years from the date of award.   EVALUATION: In making its final “best value” determination, the Government intends to consider the following non-cost/price factors, in order of descending importance (from most to least important):  (1) Technical Capability, (2) Past Performance.  (For the purpose of this source selection, the evaluation of “quality” as a factor is considered to be inherent in Technical Capability and Past Performance). The factors listed above, when combined, are significantly more important than price; however, the importance of price as a factor in the final determination increases with the degree of equality in the overall technical merit of the proposals.  As such, price will be evaluated, but not rated. Offerors should read the terms and conditions of the solicitation (once posted) carefully and refer any questions to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO).

<DESC>Technical Assistance in Agriculture: The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) provides U.S. Government assistance to developing countries that are committed to ruling justly, investing in people and encouraging economic progress.  Eligible countries develop Compacts with MCC to implement sustainable programs to achieve the goal of reducing poverty through growth.  The Division within MCC dealing with Agriculture programs and from which these requests will come is Markets and Sectoral Assessments (MSA).

MCC-MSA is seeking consulting services from individuals, private firms, universities, not-for profit or other organizations for short term assignments to evaluate the technical, economic and social issues of project proposals (due diligence) during the Compact process with MCC eligible countries.  Examples of assignments include three broad areas:  1) Technical, economic or social assessments of rural infrastructure such as market access road rehabilitation, reservoir and irrigation schemes for agriculture; 2) Technical, economic or social assessments of agricultural productivity and agricultural value chains and their impact on economic growth and poverty alleviation and 3) Technical, economic or social assessments of land tenure (rural or urban) as it relates to economic growth and poverty alleviation.  Specific fields of expertise include: agribusinesses; agriculture economics; land tenure and land market issues; watershed management and reforestation; agriculture input services; applied agriculture research and extension; agriculture cooperatives and associations; and other agribusiness related assistance.

One or more awards will be made that provide flexible and rapid response by fielding appropriate individuals or teams which meet MCC-MSA needs as they are requested.  However, awardees can specialize in one or more of the above mentioned areas of expertise.  All awardees must demonstrate a capacity to meet MCC requests quickly and with high quality.   

Consulting services can range from one day to several months in duration and on location in any one of the MCC countries (see www.mcc.gov for list of eligible countries).  The Government contemplates award of Blanket Purchase Agreements to multiple sources with a five year period of performance.  Call orders will be issued on a firm fixed price and/or Time and Materials basis.   The Government will provide no commitment to awardees for actual contract orders.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center Panama City, FL 32407 intends to solicit Kaman Aerospace Corporation, 3480 East Brittania Drive, Tucson, AZ 85706-5007 on a sole source basis for the services required to conduct laboratory tests of their one of a kind and proprietary camera. The Kaman Zenith three-dimensional camera collects a block of images consisting of 64x64 pixels and 16 frames at up to 100 million frames per second. It generates a full volumetric three-dimensional image, a “data cube” essential to image in highly scattering media such as turbid water. One data cube is produced from each laser pulse. This is accomplished using a proprietary design unique to the Kaman camera. The properties provided by this design are of critical interest to the Government in its effort to develop mine hunting technology. No other camera design, like this one, exists which would collect three dimensional imagery in the same way. Another unique design does exist which plans to acqui! re underwater imagery and that purports to deliver to the Government a capability for underwater mine detection equal to or superior to the Kaman design. It is not determinable whose design is in fact superior without evaluating the competing assertions of the parties involved. For this reason the Government must conduct a test of the Kaman design camera under conditions controlled by the Government. Testing will be performed at the Naval Support Activity Panama City, 101 Vernon Avenue, Panama City, FL 32407-7018. NAICS Code 334511 applies. SBA size standard is 750 employees. FSC is 6650.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce/National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) intends to award a one year subscription with three one-year options as a sole source simplified acquisition to the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX), University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742 for a high speed connection to regional and national research networks available only from the University of Maryland, College Park on behalf of and for the benefit of the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX). MAX is an advanced regional internetworking project for institutions of higher education, federal and state agencies and certain private entities engaged in research. MAX was founded by a consortium of universities, including Georgetown University, George Washington University and University of Maryland. The mission of MAX is the deployment of emerging technologies to provide access to high performance networking for its participants. In support of the mission, MAX is facilitating a regional network infrastructure (the “MAX Network”), that provides high speed connectivity to advanced research backbones. The MAX Network has established high-bandwidth connectivity for use among MAX participants and to the Internet2 Abilene Network (“Abilene”) operated by the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (“UCAID”). MAX Network traffic serves the teaching, learning, research, and clinical missions of US higher education, plus related support infrastructure and services. MAX does not seek to compete with commodity Internet or other telecommunications services, and is not intended to carry commercial traffic unrelated to MAX or Internet2 goals, or any traffic with proprietary, classified or illegal purposes. All high-speed connections to research networks in the Washington, DC Metropolitan Area must be connected through the metropolitan optical network run by the Mid-Atlantic Crossroads. MAX is the only source that can fulfill this requirement and therefore, the Government intends to solicit only this one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).

<DESC>The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration,   (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with Irene Saunders Goldstein,  Arlington, VA.

Purpose:

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) was created in 1992 improve prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services for individuals with mental health issues and substance abuse disorders.  Within SAMHSA, the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) provides national leadership and direction for policies, programs and activities designed to improve mental health prevention and treatment for services for people with mental health issues and their families, and people at risk of mental illness. Within CMHS, the Division of Prevention, Traumatic Stress and Special Programs (DPTSSP), the Prevention Initiatives and Priority Program Development Branch provides oversight of the Safe Schools Healthy Students (SS/HS) Initiative.  This initiative, which is a collaborative effort among the U.S. Departments of Justice, Education, and Health and Human Services, uses the Branch's expertise in developing and managing programs that foster the healthy development of children and prevent youth violence and other behavioral problems. 
In 2002, CMHS funded the creation of an oral history to describe the inception at the Federal level of the SS/HS initiative.  This project was quite successful in offering a rich description and analysis of the SS/HS grant program.  The oral history developed in 2002 led to the further funding and advancement of SS/HS.  A follow up to this initial oral history is intended to now focus on the specific histories of the current or past SS/HS grantees.  It is imperative that in addition to the quantitative data gathered from the grant evaluations, that rich qualitative information also be preserved.  These proposed stories and narratives are designed to capture the essence of the SS/HS initiative and the impact these grants have on youth and their local communities. 
Irene Goldstein is the sole author of the 2002 Oral History of the SS/HS Initiative.  She has had extensive experience in qualitative research, particularly in the field of writing oral histories.  The Oral History she produced for CMHS greatly advanced the initiative, allowing the Federal Agencies involved with funding the SS/HS grants, as well as Congress and the White House to be familiar with how these grants affect the children who participate and their schools and local community.  
Having written the 1999 Oral History of the SS/HS Initiative, Irene Goldstein now has a unique perspective into the SS/HS grantees at all levels.  From the grantee level to the sister Federal Agencies, she is aware of how these grants function.  


THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration intends to negotiate solely with I. Levy & Associates., 645 Maryville Centre Drive, suite 200, St. Louis, MO 63141-5815 under the authority of 41 U.S.C (253)(c)(1) as set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subsection 6.302-1 “Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements” for continued development  and implementation of the Electronic Folder Interface (EFI)/Document Management Architecture (DMA) software into 30 Levy supported DDSs.  

Over the last few years, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) have been engaged in major initiatives to improve the administration of the disability programs.  These initiatives included enhancements to the disability information systems used within SSA and the DDSs.   I. Levy & Associates (ILA) developed and implemented the DDSs Disability Determination Case Processing System which is the legacy system used by each ILA supported state to process disability claims.  

ILA is the only known source that can provide the support required by each state.  ILA has supported 30 DDSs for up to 20 years.  ILA has developed all the user interfaces and screen designs.  ILA owns the source code and it is assumed that they have total familiarity with the code and data structures for all the DDSs they serve.

The Electronic Disability system (eDib) is a comprehensive project for all components in the disability processing enterprise.  One of the major objectives of eDib is to provide access to and sharing of disability information to all disability processing components through an Electronic Folder.   The Electronic Folder is pictured as a data store that contains information that is directly or indirectly important to processing disability cases.

To support the next and subsequent releases, modifications will be needed to the EFI/DMA and its supporting processes to enhance additional case processing.  Any responding vendor must demonstrate success in writing COBOL and  JAVA applications utilizing  the AS400 platform, process WebSphere Messaging Queues  transactions, interface with IBM Content Manager and interface with SSA mainframe.  The software must be 100% compatible with SSA’s current infrastructure.

The Electronic Folder Interface (EFI) software must have the following conspicuous characteristics: The software must minimize modifications to the Electronic folder interface as well as the DDS legacy system application code when SSA changes the Electronic Folder’s data elements/requirements.   The software must ensure user interfaces and screen presentations that exist in the DDS systems are preserved to the greatest extent possible when interfacing with eDib.

Vendors authorized and capable of continuing SSA’s EFI development and implementation must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by SSA’s close of  business on June 02, 2005 and refer to EFI/DMA-05.  The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.   Instead, the knowledge obtained from information submitted will be used to determine whether there appears to be a competitive source in the marketplace.

<DESC>The USDA, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), intends to negotiate solely with Leco Corporation in St. Joseph, Michigan to furnish, deliver and install a new Pegasus GC x GC System and install a comprehensive gas chromatographic (GCxGC) time of flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) System inclusive of all accessories, analysis software, instrument software, computers, and monitors at the USDA, ARS, NAA, Eastern Regional Research Center located in Wyndmoor, PA 19038.

This equipment will be used for research purposes to develop new analytical methods to determine and identify dioxins and other chemicals at ultratrace levels in complex food samples.

The purchase includes the following items: 1) Leco Pegasus 4D comprehensive gas chromatograph coupled to a time of flight mass spectrometer (GCxGC/TOF-MS) with high speed thermal modulation using the liquid nitrogen cooling option and including the associated computer data system and software, installation, 1-year warranty, and tuition for a training course for 1 person. 2) the affiliated liquid nitrogen leveling system; 3) A micro electron capture detector; 4) a separate computer workstation and software; 5) Two each, 19” flat screen monitors; 6) a Gerstel CIS-3 cooled injector with an attachable thermal desorption unit and mounting kit plus its software and license; 7) the Gerstel MPS2 robotic autosampler and associated items (trays, firmware, syringes, etc.) and the Twister automation option; 8) the Leap Technologies Atas Optic 3 injection system and software plus the attachable thermal desorption unit; 9) Installation; 10) associated supplies and consumables including 10 fritted liner packs, 3 packs of o-rings, sintered glass liners, and microvials; and 11) the Leap Technologies CTC Di-Pal for direct injection including the trays, syringes, mounting kit, training, tools, cables, etc.; 12) Custom made needle guide for the USDA applications, syringe adapter, tray holder and 2-solvent wash stations.

GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS - Comprehensive GC (GCxGC) and TOF-MS entail the modulation of first column GC eluents onto a second GC column combined with full scan (at least 50-600 m/z) mass spectrometric detection at 500 scans/second.  The thermal modulator in GCxGC provides rapid heating and cooling cycles using liquid nitrogen to repeatedly transfer (typically at 2 second intervals) the eluent from one GC column to a second column of a different type.  The eluent from the second column is detected by a TOF-MS (and/or micro electron capture detector in the purchased configuration).  The system can separate, isolate, quantify, and identify through the GCxGC process and high speed full scan mass spectral data acquisition, deconvolution, and library searching essentially any thermally stable, semi-volatile chemical (and thermal degradation products) injected into the system.  The instrument allows multiple injectors, and two types of adaptable automated large-volume injection and thermal desorption devices, which provide the highly beneficial direct sample introduction approach, are included.  A separate data workstation was purchased to increase sample throughput, data handling and processing capabilities.  The Pegasus 4D instrument and associated devices provides a highly versatile and powerful analytical tool and time- and labor-saving approach for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of chemicals at ultratrace levels in complex samples.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS -  Pegasus GCxGC System with LN2 Cooled Thermal Modulator:  The system consists of a Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer with an electron impact (EI) ionization source, a mass range of 5 to 1000 m/z, unit mass resolution across the mass range, and acquisition rates of 1 to 500 full range mass spectra per second.  The differentially pumped system allows a range of helium GC effluent flow from 0 to 10 mL/min.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Please note this documents falls  under “DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT D:  Distribution authorized to Department of  Defense (DoD) and DoD Contractor’s only to protect technical or operational  data…”  To request a copy of the CDD, please send an email request to  SOF.PRV@wpafb.af.mil, stating your name, organization, and CAGE code  (Contractors only).   It is requested that comments be forwarded to ASC/LUH, Attn:  Donald C. Fisher  by COB 08 April 2005.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 029 (18 MAR 05) – Logistics response to  Industry Questions 1.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be at the same 11 bases currently  supporting the HH-60? Answer:  AFSOC intends to utilize the same bases currently supporting the HH- 60.  However, AFSOC can not speak for USAFE or PACAF assets, and BRAC may  affect basing strategy as well. 2.  Question:  Will helicopter bed down be an even distribution of aircraft or  in the same proportion as the HH-60s in the field? Answer:  It is currently planned to be a one-for-one replacement, and some  squadrons will be larger with 141 PRVs vice the 102 HH-60. 3. Question:  Will a squadron be stood up and fully equipped before sending  H/Cs to the next squadron or will there be mixed squadrons, e.g., HH-60s +  PRVs?   Answer:  Based on the previous answer there will be mixed squadrons.  AFSOC  intends to stand up a full squadron with PRVs before giving assets to the next  unit.   4.  Question:  Will two level maintenance concept be a true two level or  perhaps three level where the capability already exists, e.g., engines,  hydraulics, aircraft electrical and two level for the mission equipment  (avionics)?  Answer:  It is envisioned to maximize a two level maintenance approach. Engines  will be the only consideration of a back shop if the MAJCOM wishes to continue  in that fashion. PRV is to make maximum use of the Condition Based Maintenance  (CBM). The CBM approach will eliminate the need for such shops. 5.  Question:  In regards to two level maintenance concept, are there different  concepts at FOL vs MOB/Support Service Center?  Answer:  The PRV will need to be self sustainable at the FOL with the limited  RSP they deploy with, and their Support Equipment (SE) deployment package.  It  is the responsibility of the bidders to determine how, based on the FOL posture  what PRV systems will be required to function in a deployed scenario.   6. Question:   Please specify Total System Performance Responsibility (TSPR):  indicate a total “TSPR” or just for the aircraft, aircraft systems, and mission  equipment; parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSR)? Answer:  TSPR is not planned; anticipate Performance Based Logistics (PBL)  approach. For parts, Supply Chain Management, and Field Service Reps (FSRs) a  Contractor Supported Weapon System (CSWS) is appropriate.   7.  Question:  Please address maintenance/updates to simulators/trainers;  maintain/update curriculum, and providing instructors.   Answer:  Sustainment is based on decisions from Training Systems Requirements  Analysis (TSRA) and developed Training System (TS).  Maintain/update curriculum  and provide instructors will be part of overall TS sustainment package. 8.  Question:  Regarding flight hours per aircraft, utilization rate of 50  hours (T) + 65 hours (O):  Is this actually the operations tempo that is  planned?  This is a somewhat high tempo that drives sparing, maintenance, man- hours (MMHs) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC).   Answer:  It’s the user’s requirement.  Availability is noted as one reason for  replacement of the HH-60’s.  If reliability is designed effectively into the  system then this should not be a factor.   9.  Question:  Will Training System Requirements Document (TSRA) be provided  with the draft RFP, final RFP or contract award? Answer:  Required to be developed by the successful bidder. 10.  Question:  TSRA is a big cost driver!  The CDD states “All test  participants will receive training using the operational training concept and  systems identified in the ILSP and TSRA prior to IOT+E.”  Should this be  deferred to LRIP/Production?  Answer:  No   11. In regards to simulator/trainer locations, are full suite MOB/Support  Service Center only, and do limited suites at other locations include Virtual  Flight Simulator and Part Task Trainers? Answer:  Both full suite and limited suite will be derived from the TSRA.  12.  Are there existing Air Force Specialty Codes (AFSCs) supporting the HH-60? Answer:  Due to the highly integrated systems there are now AFSCs that address  this.  To date, the most current use of these AFSCs is on emerging platforms.   It is anticipated the AFSCs will be based on the new Integrated Systems AFSC.

PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 026 (28 FEB 05) - PRV LIBRARY DOCUMENTS  See below documents for Integrated Risk Management Plan (AFMCP 63-101 dated 9  July 1997; and Risk Management Guide, dated June 2003).    PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 025 (28 FEB 05) - Request for Information  (RFI) 1.	The Personnel Recovery Vehicle (PRV) is currently required to be  fielded in FY10 with IOC in FY 11.  This schedule includes a 2 year Government  flight test program.  For Block 0, the current PRV acquisition strategy has  changed to allow a two-year development program.  In order to meet various  AFSOC requirements, a Link-16 capability will be required in Block 0. 2.	Provide the following information: a.	Identify if you will be able to develop a Link-16 capability in the  shortened development timespan. b.	Identify what Link-16 hardware would be integrated. c.	Identify if you would be re-using software developed on another  program.  If so, please identify program source. d.	Identify what Link-16 messages you believe is required for PRV and  which messages you would be able to provide in Block 0. e.	Identify Block 10 migration plan to transition your proposed Link-16  implementation to a MIDS-JTRS implementation. f.	What is your assessment of the risk of this effort and your proposed  mitigation plan? g.	Would you be integrating Common Link Integration Processing (CLIP) in  Block 0 for GIG and/or Airborne Network communication?  Explain why or why not. 3.	Provide your response not later than 4:00 PM, EST, 7 Mar 05. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 024 (11 FEB 05) - UPDATED PRV LIBRARY  DOCUMENTS The below attached file as of 11 February 2005 is updated to include:  AFI 63- XXX, June 2003, Reformed Supply Support; Mil-HDBK-514, 28 March 2003, DoD HDBK,  Operational Safety, Suitability, + Effectiveness for the Aeronautical  Enterprise; Mil-HDBK-516A, 5 February 2004, DoD HDBK, Airworthiness  Certification Criteria.  PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 023 (11 JAN 05) – SRD RFI extension and  Q+A on SRD RFI  SRD RFI as shown in Amendment 20 has extended the deadline for response from 11  Jan 05 to 26 Jan 2005. Clarification on SRD RFI: Question:  Requirements of sections 3.3.7.8, 3.3.9.3.4, 3.3.9.3.5, and  3.3.9.4.1.4 appear to exceed the CDD. We just wanted to confirm the intent,  understanding that this is certainly your prerogative. Response:  With respect to 3.3.7.8., the SRD does not necessarily exceed the  CDD but rather reflects the use of this capability for night missions and  reducing crew workload.  (Ref CDD:  "Night missions and crew workload require  the use of artificial aids to enable night operations.  Night operations  include the use of Night Vision Imaging System (NVIS) goggles, infrared  detection set (IDS), and helmet mounted displays (HMD) or other  technologies.")  However, at this point in time we do not know the full extent  to which HMDs will be used. Question:  "The PRV attributes needed to support Initial Operational Capability  (Block 0) are addressed by Section 3 statements without symbol markings and  those that are followed by "T", unless specifically marked as Block 10 (defined  as full capability). ..."  This essentially says that anything with no markings  or a "T" is a Block 0 requirement, which means nearly everything is a Block 0  requirement.  Is this correct? Response:  Yes, items with no markings or a "T" are Block 0 requirements as  stated by the User. PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 022 (07 JAN 05) - Request for Information  See below attached file for RFI (MS word document) and CDD-RFI (MS Excel  document). Responses are due NLT 1600 EST, 13 Jan 05.   PERSONNEL RECOVERY VEHICLE AMENDMENT 021 (14 DEC 04)- Risk/schedule reduction  efforts  The Air Force intends to issue four contracts in support of risk/schedule  reduction efforts in support of the planned competition for the Personnel  Recovery Vehicle (PRV).  These contracts will be issued to the contractors who  have currently expressed interest in proposing for the PRV program.  The goal  of the contracts will be to enable the acceleration of the performance of the  PRV program after award.  The four contracts are planned to be issued to  Northrop Grumman, Bell-Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Sikorsy at an estimated  value of $1.25M each.

<DESC>Modification to submission posted on FedBizOpps on May 10, 2005 is modified as follows:

Quotes are due June 7, 2005.  

The Economic Price Adjustment clause is replaced in its entirety by the following:  Contract rates will be adjusted annually, when the contract is renewed, in accordance with the following to reflect increase or decreases in the cost of performance of the contract work.  Adjustments of rates will be based on changes in the folloiwng price indices:  (a) The Average of: (1) The Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Priced Index for all urban consumers (all items).  (2) The Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (all items).  The newly adjusted rates will become effective annually upon renewal of the contract.  The new rates will reflect the changes in the indices over the 12 calendar month period ending 45 days immediately prior to the annual adjustment.  The rates will be derived by multiplying the average percentage change in the indices times the current contract rate.  The result will be added to or subtracted from the contract rates to become the newly adjusted rates.  The rates (rounded to the next dollar)to be adjusted as indicated herein are:  All hourly priced rates listed in the Schedule of Items.

ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT – STATE WORKER’S COMPENSATION INSURANCE

Contract unit prices may be adjusted at the time an option is exercised, to reflect general increases or decreases in State Worker’s Compensation insurance rates for the categories of labor applicable to this contract.  The Contractor shall submit a current statement showing rates charged per $100 gross payroll to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days after receipt of a written request.  Adjustments will be limited to increases or decreases in the general rates only, exclusive of any modifier applicable to an individual Contractor and shall not include any amount for general and administrative cost, profit, or overhead.

Example:

Unit Price = $300.00
Percent of Unit Price Affected (wages, excluding payroll taxes) = 50%
Percent increase in Worker’s Compensation Rate = New rate per $100 gross payroll ($48.00) – Previous rate per $100 gross payroll ($40.00)


$300 X $48.00 - $40.00 X .50
	         100		= $12.00			New Unit Price = $312.00

<DESC>Technical Point of Contract:  Russell Dyreng, (801)586-7287, email russell.dyreng@hill.af.mil

This is only a Request for Information (RFI), not a Request for Proposal (RFP) and is not considered a commitment by the Government.  All information received will be for planning purposes only.  The Secondary Power Commodity Council (SPCC) does not intend to award a contract on the basis of your response nor otherwise pay for the preparations of any information presented or the use of any such information.  The RFI responses will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government.  All proprietary information should be marked as such.   

This effort is to improve material availability, delivery, quality, cost savings and increase reliability of secondary power systems through Performance Based Logistics (PBL).  This PBL effort incorporates the Power by the Flight Hour concept, whereby the contractor is paid fixed rate per flying hour.  This PBL effort is applicable to, but not limited to, the secondary power systems for the following aircraft A-10, B-1, B-2, C-5/E-3, F-15, C-130, C-141, and ground carts.  A central tenant of PBL is a contractor who is responsible for all performance outcomes.  The  contractor must have the necessary design, manufacturing, production, and process data capable to provide the performance outcomes, predetermined levels of availability (i.e. delivery within 2-4 days CONUS, 5 days OCONUS, etc.), reliability increases from technology insertion, engineering for design changes, and technical data revisions for the Honeywell International Incorporated (HII) secondary power systems.  This may require a potential offeror, on occasion, to supply newly manufactured major components, i.e. APUs, secondary power systems, and accessories to meet support requirements. The essence of this PBL effort is buying performance outcomes, not the individual parts and repair actions.  Instead of buying set levels of spares, repairs, tools, and data, the new focus is on buying predetermined level of availability and increased performance of the HII secondary power systems to meet the warfighter’s objectives.  The success of this PBL Power by the Flight Hour concept is based on the contractor’s efforts such as (to name a few), in building a better system, modifying an existing system, improving the logistic support organization, spares optimization, etc. 

SPCC Market research shows this effort is sole source to the original equipment manufacturer. 

This PBL must comply with 10 U.S.C. 2474 Centers of Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE), which authorizes and encourages the head of the CITE to enter into a public-private partnership.  A public-private partnership will be established with the contractor and current organic depot, OO-ALC which is located at Hill AFB, Ogden, Utah.  All touch-labor is anticipated to be performed by the OO-ALC Depot with the support described above provided by the contractor.  It is anticipated that the contractor will be responsible for maintaining and controlling the current inventory of APUs, secondary power systems, accessories, modules, line replaceable units, spares and repair parts.   Historically, labor has been accomplished on repair bridge contracts and by OO-ALC Depot when the workload transferred from SA-ALC to OO-ALC.  10 U.S.C. 2466, stipulates DoD must maintain a core logistics capability that is Government-owned and Government-operated.  Therefore the workload previously performed under repair bridge-contracts will be performed by the OO-ALC Depot. 

Responses to this announcement shall include the following: 1) Detailed descriptions of capability and experience in PBL Power by the Flight Hour for APUs, secondary power systems, and accessories for all aircraft listed above;  2) Current or previous contracts on PBL Power by the Flight Hour for APUs, secondary power systems, and accessories or similar; 3) Impediments or unique issues that would apply to support at the end item level; and 4) Business size and percentage goals for small businesses.   Please do not send brochures or other marketing information.  Responses must be electronically submitted in accordance with this synopsis and shall be limited to 10 pages.  

Capable sources are requested to submit electronic technical capability statements and relevant information by 10 June 2005 to:  Justen Bonham, OO-ALC/OBS SPCC, phone (801) 586-7286, Justen.bonham@hill.af.mil.

<DESC>CONTAINER SECURITY DEVICE

1.   DESCRIPTION.  The goal of this RFI is to identify currently available intermodal shipping container security devices (CSD’s).  The primary emphasis is on assuring the physical security of the container specifically directed at the opening, closing, or removal of the container doors.  Secondary emphasis is on detection of the container location, the status of any seals or locks, and the recording of container interactions. The device must survive the rigors of intermodal transport, especially the marine environment.

2.   NOTICE.  This notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  This notice does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever.  Further, HSARPA is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this notice; all costs associated with responding to this notice will be solely at responder expense.  Not responding to this notice does not preclude participation in any future RFP if issued.  If a solicitation is released, it will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.  It is the responsibility of potential offerors to monitor these sites for additional information. 

3.   BACKGROUND.  DHS is currently conducting an integrated research, development, test and evaluation program to develop secure supply chain systems.  This program includes future data and communications architecture, portal inspection systems, advanced trade data collection, advanced targeting systems, cargo tracking and tagging systems and container security devices – both present state of the art and future Advanced Container Security Devices (ACSD).  These certified CSD systems, able to verify the integrity of the container, when coupled with the appropriate data networks and risk assessment systems, will be a key component of the DHS cargo security strategy.

To provide a baseline for these efforts, DHS is interested in understanding and testing the current state of the art in those container security devices offered as existing commercial products.  The intent is to procure an unspecified number of devices to be tested in laboratory, field and operational conditions to characterize their performance characteristics, reliability, interoperability and operations concept.  This RFI seeks information on such products.

4.   TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS.  The Container Security Device should address the following functions:

(1)	Sensing
a.	Sense detection of opening, closing, or removal of either of the container doors. The devices should detect a door gap greater than one inch within 3  seconds.  A door gap created by the racking or deformation of the container should NOT be falsely detected as a door opening.  A door gap created by the physical act of partially opening a door should be detected as a “door opening” event only.
b.	Optionally, detect the container seal status, if an e-seal is available
c.	Optionally, track and monitor the location of the container in its normal intermodal movement, including in-bond shipments

(2)	Alerting
a.	Monitor or scan the sensors for conditions warranting an alert
b.	Provide notification of each alert event or change in status to the data function

(3)	Data
a.	Record and maintain a digital file of all time stamped alert events, arm/disarm events, and any other relevant data such as the optional location of the container.
b.	Optionally, allow for the input and retrieval of user supplied data such as the Container and Seal IDs.

(4)	Communications
Provide a means to communicate (locally and/or remotely) with the device for the purpose of arming/disarming the device and passing/retrieving log data to/from the CSD for the evaluation of the device.

(5)	Physical Interfaces
a.	Have the ability to be readily retrofitted into an existing ISO container and trailer so as to not substantially reduce the cargo volume of the container nor restrict its stacking, securing, or handling.  

b.	Be operable on all ISO “dry box” and  refrigerated containers (“Reefers”) and trailers.

(6)	Operating Considerations
a.	Operate in the harsh environment of maritime and intermodal transportation, including the ability to withstand the shock, vibration, temperature extremes, corrosion, and handling impacts involved.

5.   SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.  In order to evaluate the offeror’s CSD devices, responses must include:

(1)	A cover page with company name and address, with business and technical contact information to include e-mail, fax, telephone, and web page;

(2)	Identification of any existing federal government contracts for the CSD, including agency, agency point of contact, and contract / purchase order number;

(3)	An explanation of why the device is considered COTS or non-developmental, and provide any supporting sales or application history;

(4)	An explanation of how the device meets the technical requirements listed in this document;

(5)	A list of items required to support laboratory and field testing of the CSD systems including, but not limited to:
a.	Cabling
b.	Software
c.	Readers (Portable and/or Fixed)
d.	Equipment associated with the device’s communications

(6)	Include the following documentation in electronic format utilizing PDF, if available:
a.	System User’s Manual, which documents
i.	How to install the system
ii.	How to use/operate the system
iii.	How to maintain the system
b.	Testing Report, which documents

Statement of Work

Summary:

Background:

The success or failure of Government initiatives rests on the timely and accurate communication of information. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is a vast department with a number of dynamic operating divisions dispersed throughout the county. Almost every form of communications technology is represented within HHS’s five broadcast studios. Technical compatibility and connectivity between Headquarters and the Operating Divisions is essential, and more urgently, HHS Headquarters must be able to speak directly to the public in times of emergency. A few years ago, these deficiencies would have been inconveniences. In today's world, they are strategic weaknesses in the Government’s communications network. We must create a communications system structure that addresses the connectivity between all of HHS and the American people.

<DESC>MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING VENDORS THAT CAN SUPPLY THE REQUESTED ASHER DESCRIBED BELOW.

Low Temperature Ashers 

Metal-Nonmetal respirable dust samples are collected on PVC membrane filters.  The samples cannot be directly analyzed for silica on the filter used for collecting the samples; the filter matrix must be destroyed and the dust must be redeposited onto membrane filters with more desirable analytical properties.  Metal-Nonmetal samples to be analyzed by x-ray diffraction can be ashed in a hot muffle  as an alternative to  low temperature ashing.  If ashing in a hot muffle is used the dust samples would have to be treated with hydrochloric acid to remove calcite, which might otherwise react with quartz and thus result in a negative bias in the quartz analysis.

Four chamber low temperature radio frequency ashers are used to prepare MNM samples for silica analysis at the PSHTC laboratory.  The systems employ radio-frequency induced oxygen plasmas operating at .001 atmosphere pressure to decompose the samples at a temperature of approximately 250 Co.  Each asher consists a vacuum system, a radio frequency generator, an oven compartment containing the RF coils and chambers, a matching network of tuning capacitors to balance the RF load, and a controller for RF forward power, oxygen flow, and cycle time.

A two hour ashing cycle is required to oxidize the air filter and the organic carbon components for each set of 20 samples.  Because of the chemical pretreatment required, the use of alternative techniques is not feasible for processing 8,000 enforcement samples per year. 

ALL VENDORS THAT MEET AND CAN SUPPLY THIS REQUIREMENT PLEASE SEND YOUR INFORMATION ELECTRONICALLY TO hampton.katheryn@dol.gov, och.william@dol.gov OR FAX A COPY TO (304) 256-3332.

<DESC>The National Environmental Satellite Data Information Service (NOAA/NESDIS) intends to extend a sole source contract with the Aerospace Corporation for approximately 60 staff per year, effective July 31,2006, for a period of 9 months.  The Aerospace Corporation is the single, experienced capable source that is qualified to support NOAA/NESDIS with the required independent engineering analyses. The Aerospace Corporation, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) formed in 1960 by the USAF, in accordance with  10 U.S.C. Sect. 2367,  has recently completed a Comprehensive Review that was approved by the Under Secretary of the Air Force for Research and Development reaffirming the Aerospace Corporation’s mission to support national security, civil and commercial space programs.  The Aerospace personnel, who have supported the NOAA/NESDIS for the past 5 years, have first-hand knowledge of the engineering design of delivery systems and the spacecraft platforms of military and civilian polar-orbiting and geosynchronous spacecraft. The Aerospace Corporation’s experience includes the integration of military, civilian and foreign meteorological sensors, the impact of command, control and communications links between the ground control stations and the platforms/systems, and the analysis of satellite instrument data. The NOAA/NESDIS manages NOAA’s operational geo-stationary and polar-orbiting environmental satellite programs.  The NOAA/NESDIS objective is to provide the spacecraft, launch services, and ground systems necessary to maintain the uninterrupted flow of remotely-sensed environmental data required to promote, protect, and enhance the Nation’s economy, security, environment, and quality of life.  The Contractor's role in the NOAA/NESDIS Organization is as an independent, objective, non-competitive Corporation whose mission under this contract is to support the program acquisition objectives of the NOAA/NESDIS and related NOAA programs. The Aerospace Corporation will provide non-advocacy assessments of program implementation, design approach, advanced pre-development planning, developmental and operational risks, integration and test data analysis, launch readiness assessment, on-orbit performance assessment, ongoing analyses of associated technologies, and support to failure analysis inquiries. The Contractor will provide technical assistance and advice in the preparation and resulting evaluation of complex technical specifications. The Aerospace Corporation maintains the unique competency and diverse expertise through its long-term design support and engineering review of civilian and military meteorological satellite platforms. Its corporate and business practices protect Government and industry's interests and objectives by safeguarding proprietary and privileged information from misuse, and reducing the Government's costs due to duplication, delay and other general programmatic risks. Aerospace Corporation’s corporate resources and facilities help advance the Government objectives to promote competition, reduce costs of acquiring and operating the converged satellite systems, and satisfy the programmatic requirements for NOAA/NESDIS. The Government's reliance on the Aerospace Corporation for this unique competence and independent base of advanced skills validates the exception from full and open competition under 41 U.S.C 253(c)(1). Other parties who desire consideration for this requirement must fully identify their capabilities in writing to the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the posted date of this presolicitation notice. 
NOTE:  For more information on this action’s follow-on effort, please reference Presolicitation Notice Reference No. NE-EK0000-5-00282 posted on May 19, 2005.

<CONTACT>Angie Landis, Contract Specialist, Phone 410-965-9529, Fax 410-965-9560, Email angie.landis@ssa.gov
<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking sources capable of providing scanning support for legal documents (i.e., Section 218 Agreements) that must be preserved. The Section 218 Agreement is a voluntary agreement between a State and SSA for the latter to provide specified Social Security Coverage for State and local government employees in accordance with Section 218 of the Social Security Act. Section 218 Agreements have been in effect for over 50 years.  This requirement entails the scanning of documents totaling approximately 646,000 pages.  Most of the documents are multiple pages with standard print on one side of letter sized paper; however, there are some documents that may have double-sided print. The estimated number of pages by location are as follows: Seattle, WA (87,000 each); New York, NY (unknown but probably about 30,000 each); Dallas, TX (79,000 each); Philadelphia, PA (37,000 each); Denver, CO (39,000 each); Atlanta, GA (35,000 each); Chicago, IL (46,000 each); Kansas City, MO (31,000 each); San Francisco, CA (30,000 each); Boston, MA (17,000 each); and Baltimore, MD (two locations with 115,000 each and 100,000 each respectively).  SSA requires that the scanned output be in a PDF and/or TIF format, that the medium be CD/DVD, that the quality of print be 200-400 dots per inch and that the output be indexed (i.e., once a file is scanned it is indexed/labeled in order that SSA can associate a scanned image with a description). SSA will not perform any pre-scanning tasks (e.g., staple removal).  Because of the age of many of the agreements, the degree of quality seen from one document to the next varies greatly. Many of the older documents are printed on onion skin or duplicate paper, yellow-hued paper or on white paper with blue, black, purple or brown ink. Also, raised edges and small tears may exist. In view of the foregoing, the overall condition of the documents must be considered to be from poor to good and it is essential that a contractor’s scanning equipment be able to automatically adjust itself for pages of various size and quality without manual configuration being required.  Although SSA is willing to consider any and all proposed solutions, on-site scanning is strongly preferred.  Under any technical solution, the contractor must provide all labor, supervision, materials and equipment required to scan the documents.  If documents must be scanned off-site SSA will organize and provide the documents by state and year.  The contractor must guarantee that the documents will be handled in a secure manner.  Companies that believe they can offer a technically compliant solution in accordance with the above requirements and constraints are invited to submit information concerning their scanning capabilities.  Detailed responses to each of the requirements and constraints are required along with a description of the technical solution proposed. Previous references for similar scanning support must be provided.  If nationwide support is not practical, the extent of support that can be provided is to be identified.  If off-site scanning is required companies must describe how the documents will be received and returned and how the company would keep track of which states belong to which Regional Office for returning the original agreements and the scanned material.  Simple marketing information or incomplete responses will not be considered.  Reference to vendor web sites is not considered a valid response.  Pricing data is not required.  Respondents will not be notified of the results of the evaluation of the information received.  No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received; however, this information will be used in SSA’s assessment of capable sources.  Electronic responses to this notice should be submitted in duplicate within 15 days of this publication to Angie Landis via email at angie.landis@ssa.gov.  Requests for copies of a solicitation will not be honored or acknowledged.

<SUBJECT>70 -- Avaya Telephone System Maintenance Service
<DESC>This serves as a “Notice of Intent” to award a sole source task order for telephone system maintenance services to Avaya, Inc. under the GSA Schedule IT 70 contract, pursuant to FAR 8.4.  The General Services Administration (GSA) Federal Supply Service (FSS) is responsible for supporting an integrated phone system to service offices located in the continental United States (CONUS).    In the early 1990’s, FSS established a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) in Ft Worth, Texas that integrated its call centers located throughout the CONUS.  The intent was to standardize technology to reduce maintenance and overhead costs as well as leverage existing technology for future expansion, such as voice over IP (VOIP).  The competitive award was made to Avaya, and encompasses all of the FSS call centers in Fort Worth, Texas as well as FSS offices located in Philadelphia PA, Forest Park GA, Kansas City MO, Lampoc CA, Auburn WA, and Crystal City headquarters office locations also leverage off the Fort Worth, Texas Avaya voice system.    Subsequently, FSS has added enterprise functions and installed Avaya desktop phones throughout the organization.  The telephone system also now supports COOP survivability and redundancy requirements needed to sustain  critical operations in the event of an emergency.   The scope of this effort includes:  Case Management Support – on minor and major trouble reports FSS through a Single Point of Contact (SPOC).  Upon notification, FSS will be given the option to either call the designated team for status or go to the Avaya customer support website.  For major troubles, FSS will be notified all troubles that are not cleared by EXPERTtm.  Major Troubles are defined in the service agreement (attached).  Enhanced Remote Service (ERS) – Remote diagnostic and repair service for Avaya components.  This includes trouble isolation, trouble referral, cooperative testing, case management, and resolution related to Local Exchange Companies (LEC’s), Inter Exchange Carriers (IXC’s) and vendors of network interface equipment (Channel Service Units, T1 Cabling, and Multiplexers) for lines that terminate in Avaya switches.  Off-Board Alarming – Provide priority treatment for off board alarms associated with network facilities.   FSS requires this automated capability to defray the costs of hiring full time staff.
This procurement is conducted under the authority of Section 201 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 USC 501).  The Federal Acquisition Regulation basis is cited in FAR Subpart 6.302-1(b)(1), “Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements When there is a reasonable basis to conclude that the agency's minimum needs can only be satisfied by-  (a)(2)(ii) Supplies may be deemed to be available only from the original source in the case of a follow-on contract for the continued development or production of a major system or highly specialized equipment, including major components thereof, when it is likely that award to any other source would result in- (A) Substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition; or (B) Unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. (See 10 U.S.C. 2304(d)(1)(B) or 41 U.S.C. 253 (d)(1)(B).); and (b)(i) Unique supplies or services available from only one source or only one supplier with unique capabilities; or  (2) The existence of limited rights in data, patent rights, copyrights, or secret processes; the control of basic raw material; or similar circumstances, make the supplies and services available from only one source; or   (4) When the agency head has determined in accordance with the agency's standardization program that only specified makes and model.  The Avaya phone system is proprietary, and there are no authorized resellers of the maintenance services for corporate enterprise/Government enterprise users.  Existing staff is only trained in the management and support of the Avaya servers.  All interested parties should request additional information, communicate concerns, or direct any questions concerning this acquisition to Holly Carr 202-329-7250, email:  holly.carr@gsa.gov.  This notice of intent is not a request for proposals, nor a solicitation for offers.

<SUBJECT>A--SPONSORSHIP OPPORTUNITY FOR WEB BASED VIDEO STREAMING FOR SPACE SHUTTLE RETURN TO FLIGHT MISSIONS (STS-114, STS-121)
<DESC>INTRODUCTION The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Vision is: To improve life here, To extend life to there, To find life beyond. As Discovery and Atlantis are readied for their respective Return to Flight (RTF) Missions, NASA is preparing to meet public demand to see the launches and missions.  NASA’s primary method for disseminating content is via the NASA Web Portal (www.nasa.gov).  Based on data from previous missions (Mars Exploration Rover Mission, Huygens Landing, etc…) we expect 20 to 30 million visits to the NASA Web Portal with 250,000 to 500,000 Internet users also accessing NASA TV coverage via Web Streaming.  The first RTF launch window is scheduled to take place in July.  For complete Space Shuttle Return to Flight information, visit the NASA Web Portal (www.nasa.gov/returntoflight). In the existing portal infrastructure, if this demand increase materializes, NASA may have to cap the number of visitors and hours of web streaming coverage.  This would force visitors to find content from other venues that may or may not cover the Return to Flight Missions. NASA is releasing this announcement to solicit in-kind proposals for web video streaming infrastructure and bandwidth services from Non-NASA entities to support increase public access for the Return to Flight Missions at no cost to NASA. NASA intends to enter into a Space Act Agreement with the selected sponsor(s) and the existing NASA Web Portal contractor to cover these actions.  The existing NASA and the NASA Web Portal contractor will handle the integration of the selected sponsor(s) in-kind solution. NASA is seeking an Agreement that will take effect July 1, 2005, and last through December 31, 2005.  In addition to these two Space Shuttle missions, NASA expects several other events to drive visitor levels to the site higher: the encounter of the Deep Space 1 spacecraft with Comet Tempel-1 expected July 4, 2005, two to three satellite launches and possibly a third Space Shuttle flight late in 2005.  Because of the nature of the launch schedule, NASA will seek the option to extend this Agreement if the launch schedule changes.  In addition, at the end of the Agreement term, and if mutually agreeable to the selected sponsor(s), NASA may seek options for extension under this Agreement.  In exchange for this sponsorship NASA will consider offers to display the logo of the sponsor(s) and give credit to the sponsor(s) on the NASA Web Portal.  NASA will consider other suitable, innovative concepts to acknowledge and publicize the Offeror’s sponsorship.	 This Announcement is open through June 13, 2005.   NASA will not issue paper copies of this announcement.	NASA reserves the right to select for Space Act Agreement all, some or none of the proposals in response to this announcement.  NASA provides no funding for reimbursement of proposal development costs.  Material submitted in response to this Announcement will not be returned.  It is the policy of NASA to safeguard all proposals as confidential and privileged information and NASA will not, without permission of the Offeror, use or disclose their contents for other than evaluation purposes.

<SUBJECT>R -- AIRBORNE MEASUREMENTS
<DESC>The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Aeronomy Laboratory (AL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with the University of Miami to provide airborne measurements to characterize sources and distributions of reactive organic trace gases in the Houston region. During the summer of 2006, a coordinated study of air quality in the Houston, TX region is being organized by NOAA that will offer the opportunity to examine the sources, distribution, transport and chemical transformations of oxidants and fine particles around the Northeastern US. The work proposed here will be to expand the capability of planned air sampling and analysis to more fully evaluate the upwind and near source trace gas signatures that have the greatest direct impact on air quality in the Houston urban area and the surrounding regions. The first stage of this work is to redesign the current whole air sampler that has been flown in different mechanical configurations on the NOAA WP-3D in past campaigns. The approach during the Houston 2006 campaign is to collect and analyze air samples from the NOAA WP-3D aircraft for a wide range of organic trace gases, including non-methane hydrocarbons, a variety of halocarbons including solvents, CFCs, HCFCs, HFCs, methyl halides, etc., selected sulfur species, and a series of C1 – C5 alkyl nitrates. The focus of the work will be on the upwind and near source areas of the study. The analyses will be conducted in a laboratory set up at the University of Miami. The University of Miami is uniquely qualified to perform these tasks because the principal investigator and his research team have developed the unique automated whole air sampling capability specifically for the NOAA WP-3D aircraft that is required for this project. In addition, they are experts in the analytical protocols and subsequent data analysis of trace gas data in the context of airborne research missions. This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13.1, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (Under $100,000). Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email. Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement. Anticipated award date will be June 10, 2005.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items as prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Solicitation Notice is No. AB133F-05-RP-1164.   The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular No. 2001-27.  NOAA’S,  National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC)) has a requirement for Satellite Dive Recorders (SDRs).  NMML conducts research on northern fur seals, a species listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).  The abundance of northern fur seals (callorhinus ursinus) on the Pribilof Islands in 2004 was estimated as being less than one-third the numbers born during the 1950’s prior to the beginning of the current population decline.  Because of the survival and health of northern fur seals is likely related to the quality of the habitat they occupy and use for foraging, reduced foraging success has been suggested as reason for the decline of northern fur seals. The instruments will be used to record individual seal behavior and transmit the data through the Argos satellite system (www.argosinc.com).  Delivery Schedule:  Quantity of 30 SDRs delivery required by September 15, 2005 and Quantity of 10 SDRs delivery required by October 15, 2005.  The instruments must meet the following specifications:  (1) The SDRs will be attached to northern fur seal pups and must be small to minimize the effects of the instruments on the animals.  Therefore, they must weigh less than 110 grams in air, and measure less than 85 mm (L) x 55 mm (W) x 25 mm (H).  (2) SDRs must have the capability of providing 60,000 transmissions at 0.5W radiated power. (3) To extend and control deployment length, the SDR must: (a) Include a wet/dry sensor that limits transmissions to when the tag is clear of the water; (b) Allow user programmable duty-cycling by day or month; (c) Allow user programmable limit of the total number of transmissions per day; (d) Allow user programmable limit of transmissions to hours when the satellite is likely to be in view; (e) Recognize whether the animal is at-sea or hauled-out, and transmit at the appropriate rates. Argos permits a maximum of one transmission every 45 seconds when the animal is at-sea, and one transmission every 90 seconds when the animal is hauled out; (f) Allow suspension of transmissions after the animal has hauled out for a user-defined number of hours. (4) The SDR must allow programmable collection of data on depth (1 m resolution), temperature, light levels, and wet/dry periods, and summarize them into compressed histograms for transmission through the Argos system.  The numbers of bins (up to 14 per histogram), the bin cut-points, the period of coverage (1-24 hours), and the starting time of each histogram must be user programmable. (5) The SDR must provide, at a minimum, the following types of data messages, selectable by the user: (a) Dive duration histograms: Number of dives within the specified dive duration ranges; (b) Maximum dive depth histograms: Number of dives whose maximum depth is within the specified depth ranges; (c) Time-at-depth histograms: Time spent within the specified depth ranges; (d) Time-at-temperature histograms: Time spent within the specified temperature range; (e) Percentage timelines: What percentage of the hour the tag was above a user-specified threshold depth, or dry; (f) 20-minute timelines: Each 24 hour period is divided into 20-minute increments. Each increment is marked with whether it was generally deeper than a configurable depth, or was dry; (g) Each timeline must be stored and transmitted for at least 4 days to ensure complete records are received through the Argos system.  Because the behavior of diving animals limits access to the Argos satellite system, the SDR must provide the option of condensing multiple data messages into a single transmission to increase data throughput.  Transmissions must include status messages at user-programmable intervals for battery voltage, the number of transmissions sent, the current zero-pressure offset value, the current time according to the internal clock, seawater conductivity, and maximum depth reading over the last 24 hours.  (6) The SDR must be potted in resin (preferably clear) to withstand pressure at depths up to 1000 m of water.  The potting must be cast in as hydrodynamic a form as possible, given the limitations imposed by the internal components, and be abraded on the bottom surface for adhesion to quick-setting epoxy, used to attach the SDR to a seal’s pelage.  (7) All user programming and control of the SDR must be provided through included software that runs under the Microsoft Windows XP operating system.  At least two sets of cables and other hardware required for programming/controlling the SDRs must be provided.  Windows-based software must be provided for user decoding of the Argos data into an easy-to-read format.  All SDRs are to be Shipped F.O.B Destination to:  National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115-6349 by the required delivery date.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation. A quotation is being requested, and a written request for quotation will not be issued. The announcement number is F1T0CZ5129A200.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334513, with Small Business standard size 500 employees. Please identify your business size in your response based upon this standard. This requirement is for, CLIN 0001, One, Each (1), Phased Doppler Interferometer System.1. The instrument shall be a laser interferometer suitable for measurement of particles found within icing clouds with the following ranges of conditions; Particle Sizes: 2 to 1,500 microns; Liquid Water Content (LWC): 0.01 to 5.0 grams water per cubic meter air; Temperature:  -30 to +32 degrees Fahrenheit; Wind Speed:  5 to 300 miles per hour; Minimum Cloud Duration:  1 hour. 2. The instrument shall be able to simultaneously determine both size and velocity of particles within icing clouds, which range in size from 2 to 1,500 microns at a sampling rate not less than 250,000 drops per second. 3. The instrument shall be a single particle counting instrument (not using laser diffraction for ensemble particle characterization), utilizing phase Doppler interferometer based on light wavelength (not scattering intensity), or 1-D or 2-D droplet imaging technology, or may be a combination of these.  4. The instrument shall have a particle measuring inaccuracy of not more than +/-0.5 microns, shall have a particle measurement resolution of within +/-0.5 microns, and shall have a particle velocity measurement inaccuracy of not more than +/-0.1%.  5. If the instrument requires the use of more than one sampling probe (because of sizing range), it shall be able to capture data from all probes, either simultaneously or by multiplexing, and through software, combine the data from all probes into a single particle size distribution which represents a total sampling time of not more than 5 seconds (unless this is a user-selectable variable and the user desires a longer averaging time). 6. If the instrument utilizes more than one sampling probe (because of sizing range), all probe heads of adjacent size range shall having overlapping size range of not less than 50 microns. 7.If the instrument uses multiple sampling probe heads, the sample volumes of all probe heads shall be restricted to an area not larger than 6 inches wide by 6 inches high.  Additionally, no probe's sampling volume shall be closer than 6 inches from the mounting flange of any probe head. 8.   All probe head components shall be securely affixed to the probe head to preclude the possibility of vibrating loose or being detached by winds with minimum 300 mile per hour velocity. 9. All probe heads shall either use stainless steel for exterior surfaces or be painted and sealed to prevent intrusion of cloud liquid water from entering the interior.  Exterior surfaces shall avoid aluminum unless anodized and painted. 10.  Probe head mounting flange boltholes shall be countersunk to allow for flush-mount fasteners (i.e. to avoid bolt heads in the open flow near the area where measurements are to be made). 11.     Total weight of all probe heads combined shall not exceed 20 pounds (cabling and fasteners excluded). 12.    The instrument shall be able to calculate from the combined particle size distribution, the median volume diameter at a rate not slower than once every 5 seconds and shall be able to graphically display the particle size distribution.  The instrument shall also be able to graphically display as a running electronic strip chart, the calculated values for MVD and velocity. 13.  If the instrument uses an optical array probe as one of the probe heads, the system shall be able to store and display graphical images of the measured particles. 14. The instrument shall provide a real-time output (either digital or analog) of the measured particle velocity.  If the output is analog, it shall be either 4-20 ma or 0-10 VDC. 15.   The instrument shall be able to capture data and average for longer periods of time, up to averaged sampling times of at least 60 seconds.
      16.  The instrument shall require factory calibration not more than once per year.  
       17. The instrument shall be able to accept an input (such as index of refraction) for            selection of measurements of particles other than water (such as glass micro spheres).  Specifically, if glass micro spheres were used for field verification of the calibration, and the instrument's sizing process makes use of the index of refraction of the particles, then the instrument shall be able to accept an input from the user for the index of refraction for the specific micro spheres to be used for the verification and the instrument shall make use of this input in the sizing process. 18.    The instrument shall be able to be assembled, aligned, and ready for use from a storage mode in not more than 4 hours. 19.    The instrument shall incorporate probe heads, which are aerodynamically shaped; specifically, all leading edge surfaces must be rounded and all trailing edges tapered smoothly to an edge no wider than 1/32 inch. 20. The instrument shall incorporate probe heads, which are electrically heated to prevent ice accretion in all clouds as specified in 1 above.  Additionally, the instrument shall be designed such that activation and use of such electrical deice heating shall not influence the measurement accuracy.  Additionally, use of such electrical deice heating shall be designed such that it self-regulates temperature and AUTOMATICALLY prevents damage if the system is left in the DEICE mode and the wind speed decreases to zero velocity for at least one hour. 21.     The instrument shall be configured such that the probe heads may be located a minimum distance of 150 feet from the display components.  Additionally, if the instrument requires any other components other than cabling between the probe heads and the display unit, those components shall be housed in not more than one enclosure.  Such an enclosure shall be located not less than 20 feet from the probe heads.  Such an enclosure shall be watertight and suitable for immersion within all icing clouds specified in 1 above.  The enclosure is NOT required to be capable of remaining ice-free. 22. The instrument may use fiber optic cabling inside probe heads, enclosures, or display units, but shall avoid the use of fiber optic cables for the connecting cabling between these components.  Additionally, all cabling between major components shall be incorporated into the minimum number of sheaths. 23.     All operation of the instrument shall be accomplished from the display unit or associated computer once assembly, power-up, and alignment is complete (i.e. system is ready to measure cloud particles).  The instrument shall not require the operator to make any adjustments to devices on the probe heads or other enclosures other than those physically located on the display unit or associated computer. 24.     If the system requires any other power source than 110 VAC, 60 Hz, the appropriate power supplies shall be included as part of the system. 25.   The instrument shall be delivered with a manual incorporating complete written assembly and operating instructions, minimum one year warranty from date of delivery, a pair of protective eyewear which is designed for protection from the specific laser used in its design, storage cases suitably lined to protect the components for long term storage and convenient transport or shipping.  26.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Request for Proposals HSSS01-05-R-0010 issued as a Request for Proposals (RFP) through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-03.  This action is a 100% small business set-aside. The NAICS code is 481211 and the small business size standard is 1500. 

The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) has a requirement for air charter services to various locations, both domestic and international on an as needed basis.  The requirement is for an indefinite number of flights which the proposed contractor may be required to coordinate in as short a timeframe as 12-24 hours from a request.  The requests may be during non-business hours (i.e. weekends, after hours or holidays).  The government anticipates awarding a requirements contract with a base period of one-year from date of award and two one-year option periods to be exercised at the discretion of the government.  The minimum number of services (flights) that may be requested during the base period and option periods is one trip and the maximum is ten.  This requirement is dictated by mission needs, irregular and unpredictable occurrences dependent on National Security Special Events and/or USSS protectee travel.  Historically, the USSS has chartered from as few as zero planes per year, to as many as four planes per year.

The contractor will be required to arrange for domestic and international charter aircraft services. The contractor will be required to have expertise and experience with Andrews Air Force Base and the Pentagon in securing permits and landing rights for arrival and departures from Andrew’s Air Force Base. 

The contractor will also be required to have expertise and experience with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in securing waivers for USSS chartered aircraft to violate Flight Restriction Airspace Zones in the Washington D.C. area and any other flight restricted zone throughout the United States.

The contractor will also be required to have expertise and experience with the White House Travel Office in coordinating charter aircraft services between the White House and the United States Secret Service.

When the government has a charter requirement, the contractor will be required to obtain quotes for chartered aircraft of varying sizes and obtain the actual aircraft in order to accommodate the numbers of USSS employees needing to travel via chartered aircraft. The aircraft will need to be powered by jet engine and aircraft sizes will typically need to accommodate between 50 and/or up to 150-200 people per flight. On a very rare occasion the Secret Service may request quotes on aircraft large enough to accommodate only up to 10 people. 
 

The contractor must be capable of responding to requests for charter aircraft services within 12 hours of a request.  The contractor must be able to provide pricing for the proposed for a task order.  The contractor must have a mechanism in place whereby requests for quotes and charter aircraft services can be placed after hours, on weekends, and on holidays.

When the Contracting Officer (CO) requests pricing for a task order, the contractor shall provide quotes from at least three different vendors possible.  Each price quote shall include all estimated costs and the contractor’s service fee. 

Unless otherwise indicated, when the CO requests pricing for a task order, the contractor shall provide quotes for planes that are actually available for the Secret Service to reserve and for planes that are able to perform the service requested (i.e. the plane should be large enough to accommodate the passenger and baggage requirements we provide when requesting a quote.) 

The contractor will be required to work with the chartered aircraft owner/operator and the Fixed Base Operator (FBO) at the arrival/departure airports to provide the USSS with information concerning pick up/drop off points of our personnel at the airport, ramp access locations for Secret Service buses and vehicles, baggage handling arrangements, FBO names and telephone numbers.

The contractor shall provide information concerning their backup contingency plan in the event an aircraft chartered for the USSS experiences a mechanical, crew rest, weather, or other problem which prevents the aircraft from performing services as requested.

The contractor shall provide for facsimile, email, and telephonic requests for queries, information, and reservations from the Contracting Officer and Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR).

The contractor shall provide customized management reports as required by USSS. Such reports may include but are not limited to monthly and annual report of contractor activities for the USSS including frequency and dates of charter aircraft services, dollar amounts, and cost tracking reports.

The contractor shall invoice for services in accordance with the task order issued for those chartered services. 

The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining satisfactory standards of employee competency, conduct, appearance and integrity and shall be responsible for taking such disciplinary action against the Contractor’s employees as may be necessary.

I.	 STATEMENT OF WORK

INTRODUCTION

The Office of Democracy and Governance (DCHA/DG) is one of the larger offices of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance Bureau (DCHA/DG). DCHA/DG has a staff of 73 including direct hires and others.  It is the successor office of the Center for Democracy and Governance that was created in 1994 to provide technical support and guidance to USAID, especially to field missions. DCHA/DG also has an important directive, as did the old Center, to train and strengthen the Agency’s cadre of democracy officers. The Office is also charged with managing three congressionally mandated funds grouped together under the rubric of Special Programs to Address the Needs of Survivors (SPANS). They are the Leahy War Victims Fund, the Displaced Children's and Orphans' Fund, and the Victims of Torture Fund. The funds address particular needs of individuals in conflict countries.   

The DG Office is structured into 4 technical divisions plus 2 teams:  Rule of Law, Elections and Political Processes; Civil Society; and Governance- a Strategies Division; a Program and Information Team, and a SPANS team.  The Strategies Division coordinates the DG Office’s backstopping of field missions and regional bureaus, and works with these operating units to improve the quality of their democratic governance activities. The Program Division also reviews democracy and governance programs to learn from past experiences with a view to improving the Agency’s know-how in program design and implementation.  The Program and Information Team supports the office’s program function; that is, it manages the office’s budgeting and procurement processes, reporting, and collects certain statistic information about Agency democracy and governance programs.  

As a technical office in a pillar bureau, DCHA/DG has also been given the task of being prepared to respond quickly to the total failure of governance in weak states such as the collapse of the state in Afghanistan and Iraq. In such situations, technical assistance by DCHA/DG for the timely and punctuated interventions is critical. By definition a failed state is one without governance. For this reason the DG Office, plans to hire one U.S. citizen personal services contractor (USPSC) to be available to deploy to provide fast and flexible assistance targeted at the restoration or establishment of democratic governance. The deployment will be to the affected country and can last from several weeks to as long as one year. When not deployed the PSC's will be integrated into the regular DCHA/DG staff and will work under the direction of the division or team leader to which they are assigned by the DG Office Director. 

For more information about DCHA/DG and its activities, please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/democracy_and_governance.

TUNNEL TYPE: Closed circuit tunnel with single return
CAPABILITIES: q (dynamic pressure): 0 to 100 pounds per square foot / Tunnel air velocity: 0 to 300 feet per second (clear test section) / Test section static pressure:  atmospheric with a ‘breather’ downstream of the test section/ Test section temperature: ambient +/- 5 degrees F 
AIRFLOW QUALITY  (Test Section):  Flow uniformity:  0.7% variation from average velocity or less / Turbulence: 0.01% turbulence intensity or less / Flow angularity: +/-0.5 degree variation or less in pitch and yaw (clear test section) / Static Pressure Variation:  minimized along length of test section / Flow transients: none
WIND TUNNEL INSTRUMENTATION: Static pressure tap rings (minimum of 4 taps per ring) located in the plenum (nozzle entrance) and entrance to test section for q determination and one more at the downstream end of the test section.
POWER SECTION: Fan:  High efficiency, low turbulence / Motor:  Electric, variable-speed, efficient, low maintenance
CONSTRUCTION:  Steel construction, flanged sections / Windowed test section (3/4” SAR Plexiglas or equivalent with abrasion resistant coating and an aluminum frame, full length, 2 sides and ceiling) / Removable test section floor to facilitate modifications.  A prefabricated metal structure will be installed around the test section to serve as a control room.  Design and construction of the control room is not to be included in this bid package.  However, the tunnel must be equipped with flanges to accommodated sealing of the room.
SAFETY FEATURES:  Brake on fan drive / Interlocks on all access doors / Safety screen downstream from test section to catch debris
ACCESS REQUIREMENTS:  Test section (both sides) for model installation, etc., as described in above.  Drive section for maintenance and servicing.  Screen and honeycomb section for cleaning.
OTHER SPECIFICATIONS:  The wind tunnel should be level and anchored to the slab, with minimum deviation between adjacent sections.  The elevation of the wind tunnel should be set so that the centerline of the test section is no less than 5 feet up from the control room floor to facilitate user access into the test section.  If the centerline is higher than 5 feet, two elevated platforms will be required, one for each side of the test section.  These platforms will be provided by the AF on contractor’s request and can be modified as required and installed.
NOISE LEVEL:  Noise generated by the wind tunnel facility shall be less than 75 dBA at a distance of 6 feet from any location outside of the tunnel.  Noise level inside the control room shall be less than 85 dBA.  The contractor shall provide documentation of the noise level at three tunnel speeds:  100, 200, and 300 ft/sec.
COOLING:  A chilled-water radiator inside the wind tunnel, located between turns 3 and 4, for cooling of the air (provide maximum heat load, water system, maximum GPM and pressure loss), or circulate chilled water through hollow turning vanes at turns 3 and 4 (or, if necessary, through all four sets of turning vanes).  It is anticipated that, without cooling, flow temperature will rise approximately 25 degrees F above ambient temperature during a typical run.
CONTROLS:  Manual and computer operation, single operator / Keyed power on/off switch and speed setting knob for fully variable speed / Time counter to track motor usage / Remote pushbutton kill switch (at test section) to shut down fan motor

Upon successful completion of the PDR, the contractor shall submit final engineering drawings to the AF for approval and authorization to proceed (ATP).  The design must comply with all applicable State Codes, City Ordinances, Factory Mutual Insurance Company requirements, and all agencies having jurisdiction over this job.  Any required permits are the responsibility of the contractor.

(2) The contractor shall design and manufacture a research wind tunnel to AF specifications.  The contractor shall provide bi-weekly status reports to the AF focal point and allow AF representatives to visit the contractor at any time to review the design and/or inspect the wind tunnel during its manufacture.  Upon completion of the wind tunnel fabrication, the contractor shall provide as-built drawings.  Bidders shall specify whether an operational checkout at the manufacturing site will be performed.  The contractor shall also provide a written summary of the operational checkout of the wind tunnel (if performed).  The AF or a designated representative will perform a buyoff inspection at the contractor’s location prior to shipping.  On AF approval, the contractor shall package and ship the wind tunnel to the installation site in Pomona, California.

(3) The contractor shall install a Northrop Grumman (NG)-type designed model support system onto the new wind tunnel.  The model support system, seen in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/, will be constructed under a separate contract and provided to the wind tunnel contractor for installation. The contractor shall mount the model support hardware below the test section.  This system includes a strut that extends up into the test section for mounting test models.  It provides pitch and yaw control of the model.  An Interface Control Drawing (ICD) is shown in the Concept Support Picture at http://www.csupomona.edu/~aro/wt/.  It shows the model support hardware installation in the wind tunnel test section.  A NG-designed slotted turntable (45 inch diameter, 1/4 inch thick aluminum disk) will be installed into a circular cutout in the floor of the test section, flush with the tunnel’s floor surface.  The disk turns with the support system for yaw control.  The strut extends through the slotted disk and pivots to give pitch control.  The support system must be positioned and leveled (with respect to the tunnel centerline when installed) so that the center of rotation of the support system coincides with the center of the test section.

(4) The contractor shall install a base to locate the support system vertically.  The base will be attached to the floor below the test section and the support system will be mounted on top of three adjustable leveling feet.  Dimensions of the base are approximately 38 inches wide by 55 inches long by 12 inches high. (The height of the base is dependent upon the distance from the floor to the test section centerline.)  An existing base design is available from NG and will be modified and constructed by another vendor and supplied to the wind tunnel vendor for installation under the test section.

(5) The contractor shall perform functional tests of the new wind tunnel to verify that all specifications are met and make all adjustments or corrections, as required to achieve operation and test section airflow quality within the specification.  Any negative deviation from the specifications must be approved by the AF. To verify the flow quality, the contractor shall perform a detailed calibration of the airflow in the test section of the installed wind tunnel.  This would include two-dimensional mappings (every 2” in the y and z directions normal to the flow direction) of flow velocity, flow angularity in pitch and yaw, and turbulence intensity at 3 (streamwise) stations along the test section: the center of the test section and two other longitudinal stations +/-20” from the first.

(6) The contractor shall provide calibration data to correlate control panel speed setting to test section air velocity for clear test section.

(7) The contractor shall provide a training session for the AF and CPP personnel.  Topics include facility operation, maintenance, servicing, precautions, etc.

(8) The contractor shall provide two complete sets of documentation describing the operation and maintenance of the wind tunnel and all support equipment.

(9) The contractor shall provide printed engineering drawings, 2-D and 3-D in AutoCAD, of the as-built wind tunnel facility on E-size drawings (28” x 40”) and electronic drawing files on CD-ROM.  Electronic drawing files shall be provided in both .pdf format as well as AutoCAD or IGES format.

OPTIONAL STATEMENT OF WORK

Contractors shall perform the following tasks that consist of enhancements to the principal statement of work.  

(1) The contractor shall purchase and install a water cooling tower and pump system to provide chilled water to the wind tunnel.  The contractor shall size the system to maintain wind tunnel temperature at ambient +/- 5 degrees F.  Local ambient temperatures range from 50 to 105 degrees F.  It is anticipated that, without cooling, flow temperature will rise by 25 degrees F above ambient during a typical run.  The contractor shall install the tower at an AF approved location near the wind tunnel, make all required hookups (electrical, water, etc.), check out operation and obtain all of the required permits.  

(2) Improve flow quality in the test section from those specified in above (Principle Statement of Work) to - Flow uniformity:  0.25% variation from average velocity or less; Turbulence:  0.07% turbulence intensity or less; Flow angularity:  *0.1 degree variation or less in pitch and yaw (clear test section).

These are maximum values allowed at the array of points specified in the flow calibration of the test section described in the principle statement of work.

To achieve this improved flow quality, it is recommended that Items a - c below be considered.

(a) The contractor shall add two additional screens, after the honeycomb and before the contraction cone to improve flow uniformity in the test section.

(b) The contractor shall add a constant section, of length equal to one effective diameter of the tunnel at that location, between turn 4 and the contraction cone to improve flow quality in the test section.

(c) The contractor shall add corner fillets to all four corners of the test section, with proper fairings upstream and downstream of the test section, to improve flow quality in the test section. Fillets are to be such as to account for growth of the boundary layers on the walls of the test section. Therefore, the test section walls shall be parallel, in pairs.

(3) The contractor shall install lights in the test section fillets, 4 places, to improve lighting in the test section.

(4) The contractor shall provide and install noise reduction equipment (acoustic silencers) inside the wind tunnel to reduce the level of wind tunnel noise. The contractor shall specify the noise level reduction provided by the silencers (dBA) at 100, 200 and 300 ft/sec.

(5) The contractor shall provide automatic controls of wind tunnel parameters including dynamic pressure (q), temperature, model pitch, and model yaw.  Analog voltages will be available from the model support system for pitch and yaw.  The AF will provide the needed programming in LabVIEW.

(6) The contractor shall provide a comparison of costs for alternative wind tunnel construction materials (fiberglass, wood, other) and include a durability warranty extension statement.  The contractor shall make recommendations based on expected operating conditions: moderate climate, dry, windy, direct sunlight (20 – 105 degrees Fahrenheit), earthquake-proof, etc.

(7) The contractor shall provide a motorized 3-D traversing mechanism that will be mounted inside and at the downstream end of the test section and allow for flow measurements throughout most of the test section (for example the detailed calibration of the test section flow, as described on top of page 5).

(8) The contractor shall design the test section to be easily removable, interchangeable and portable and supply one additional removable test sections for 2-D airfoil testing.

(9) The contractor shall provide computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the flow in the test section and tunnel circuit.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES.

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 05-03.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.

The contractor will be responsible for selecting and translating the most important portions of the diaries, adding editorial context for the diarists’ often-cryptic references, and preparing the material for publication.  Key time periods shall be selected and translated with a view toward yielding maximum new insights on the Soviet space program. The NASA History Division shall administer this project and manage the professional review and oversight of final publication of the work. 2.0 Scope: This contract is for the preparation of a book-length manuscript containing translated and edited excerpts from the Mishin and Feokstikov diaries.  This history project shall build upon the relatively scarce existing scholarly literature on Soviet space history such as Asif Siddiqi’s book Challenge to Apollo:  The Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945-1974 (NASA SP-2000-4408). In order to place the materials in context, it must reflect extensive research of records related to the subject. The finished manuscript is to be delivered within two years.   3.0 Procedures for Historical Research: •	The contractor shall be intimately familiar with Soviet space history, both the general history of science and technology literature and science and technology studies concepts.  It is critical that the contractor understand the historical context fully and be able to choose key excerpts and explain them to a more generalized history of science and technology community.  The contractor shall use this background knowledge to structure and present an intellectually challenging set of material accessible to scholars, students, technology practitioners, policymakers, and the general public. •	The contractor shall put these memoirs into context, with translation and commentary in a form acceptable for publication as a scholarly edited memoir. This final product shall be illustrated only as appropriate to explain the issues raised in the written work. The contractor shall be responsible for identifying appropriate photographs for this book and obtaining necessary permissions for use. •	Archival material located during the course of this work shall be cited and thus made known to future researchers. Copies of research notes and documents shall be placed by the contractor in the NASA Historical Reference Collection for the use of future researchers. •	The work shall conform to similar works in the NASA History Series, such as T. Keith Glennan, The Birth of NASA: The Diary of T. Keith Glennan (edited by J.D. Hunley, NASA SP-4105, 1993) and Asif Siddiqi, Challenge to Apollo:  The Soviet Union and the Space Race, 1945-1974 (NASA SP-2000-4408). 4.0 Proposal Guidelines  NASA's budget limit for this effort is approximately $85,000.00. Items 4-1 thru 4-4 are the Technical evaluation factors which will be reviewed for selection and award.  Proposals for this study shall include the following information: •	4-1  A detailed outline explaining what years and subject areas the proposers would suggest translating and editing.	The proposers should also explain their rationales for their selections, demonstrating the historical significance of these materials.  Proposers should also detail how the topics would be covered in each chapter and how the overall narrative would flow. •	4-2  A relatively short (no more than 1-2 pages) bibliographic essay demonstrating the proposers’ familiarity with key scholarly and popular literature relevant to Soviet space history.

<DESC>The purpose of this modification is to correct the Federal Acquisition Circular number. It should read:The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-03.
This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items or services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice and in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures authorized in FAR Part 13 (not to exceed $100,000).  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The solicitation incorporates provisions and clauses in the Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-03. The proposed contract is a 100% Small Business Set-Aside. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 561730 and the small business size standard is $6.0 million.  

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS) is responsible, in accordance with Executive Order 13112 – Invasive Species, for maintaining ten (10) acres of land for its radar facility site located at SW 137th Avenue and SW 168th Street, Miami, Florida. Since at least 1993, the year the NWS KAMX WSR-88D radar was installed, no management or control of exotic plant and hardwood species has been performed on the site. The purpose of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) is to develop and implement a work plan for the first year of removing and reducing the growth of exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods on the NWS ten acre site.  

Site Background: The NWS site was previously owned by the military and is within an area referenced as the Perrine Limited Training Area (LTA). The site was part of the 2,107 acre Richmond Navel Air Station (NAS Richmond) which was active from 1942 to 1945 and ceased operations following a major hurricane.  In 1960, the U.S. Army acquired about 227.7 acres of the former NAS Richmond. Some of the land was developed, but an area of approximately 136 acres remained undeveloped as the Perrine LTA. On November 26, 2002, the General Services Administration (GSA) transferred 10 acres of the former Perrine LTA to the U.S. Department of Commerce for establishment of a clear zone adjacent the NWS radar site.  

Two federally endangered plant species have been identified on the Perrine LTA, the Deltoid Spurge (Chamaesyce deltoidea ssp. deltoidea) and the Tiny Polygala (Polygala smallii). The property also contains a critically imperiled ecosystem, the Richmond Pine Rocklands, and wet prairie natural areas. In addition to the two endangered plant species identified on the Perrine LTA, for the Richmond Pine Rocklands, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) lists two plant species Crenulate Lead-Plant (Amorpha crenulata) and Small’s Milkpea (Galactia smallii) as endangered, one species Garber’s Spurge (Chamaesyce garberi) as threatened, and 12 species as candidates for listing. Of the twelve species, nine occur in the Richmond Pine Rocklands area where the Perrine LTA is located.

The site presently has medium to high density of exotic plant and hardwood species with the Burma Reed (Neyraudia reynaudiana) and Brazilian Pepper Tree (Schinus terebinthifolius) being the most prevalent. However, the site contains other exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods which need to be treated. Although some areas of the site are disturbed, there is an abundant seed source of native plants in the area to recolonize the treated areas. At this time, no restoration work is planned for re-establishing native plant and hardwood species at the site.       

The former Perrine LTA is bounded on the south by SW 176th Street and the Army Reserve Center. The property is bound to the west by SW 137th Avenue and the same Army Reserve Center. The Federal Bureau of Prisons – Metropolitan Correctional Center borders the property to the north and the Dade Zoological Park borders the property to the east. The site presently has some minor development which includes the NWS radar facility and associated gravel access roadways.  

Work Plan: The purpose of this Request for Quotation (RFQ) is for the Contractor to develop and implement a work plan for the first year of removing and reducing the growth of exotic plant and hardwood species on the NWS owned ten acre site. Development of the work plan requires a visit to the ten acre NOAA site as discussed under “Section 5.0 Scheduled Site Visit.” As a minimum, the work plan shall include:  
A.  A discussion as to how exotic plant and hardwood species will be identified at the site for treatment.  
B.  A discussion as to the method(s) for identifying, marking the location of, and protecting each plant and hardwood species listed as being either endangered, threatened, rare or commercially exploited.  
C.  A discussion as to how exotic plant and hardwood species will be treated (mechanical methods, controlled burn, and/or application of herbicides) at the site.  Minimal use of herbicides is encouraged.  Include a discussion as to which species will be removed from the site for offsite disposal and identify the off-site disposal site(s).   
D.  A list of the equipment which will be used to treat the exotic species at the site.
E.  A list of herbicides, with the manufacturer’s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSD) for each herbicide, which will be used for treatment of the exotic plant and hardwood species.  Include the estimated quantities of each herbicide that will be applied and their potential effect on non-targeted native species should spray-over occur.  Include method(s) which will be utilized to prevent spray-over and runoff of herbicides to adjacent properties.   
F.  A schedule as to when, how many visits, and the anticipated duration of each site visit, within twelve months of the date of contract award, to fully implement the work plan. 
G.  The contractor’s cost to develop and implement the work plan.  The cost shall include all labor, materials, and equipment to perform the work.
H.  A list of qualified contractor personnel who will be identifying exotic and protected plant and hardwood species at the site, and those supervising field site activities.  Include biographies for each qualified personnel performing the work.  Include copies of applicable licenses for personnel who are required under federal, state, or local regulation to maintain licenses in performance of their duties (e.g. herbicide applicator’s license).
I.  Copies of all licenses required to fully implement the work plan (e.g. operate equipment, transport materials, apply herbicides).       

Permits and Record Keeping: The Contractor shall be responsible for obtaining all permits for the work and making all notifications, as required, to federal, state and local regulatory agencies prior to performing the work.  After the work is completed, the Contractor shall submit herbicide application records to the NOAA Contracting Officer and maintain records in accordance with the Florida Statutes, Chapter 487.160. 

Scheduled Site Visit: Prior to preparing and submitting a quotation, each Contractor is required to visit the site. Contact  Rusty Pfost, Meteorologist-In-Charge (MIC) of the Miami Weather Forecast Office (WFO), at 305/229-4502 to schedule a site visit.   

Special Field Conditions: A Final Historical Records Review document, prepared by Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. (November 2004), reports that the Perrine LTA was used for limited training activities by the U.S. Army Reserve Command between 1989 and 1999.  Training activities included a field hospital, foot patrol, and wheeled vehicle training with the potential for some blank ammunition training.  During site visits in April and June 2004, several blank small arms cartridges and one spent practice flare were observed.  If encountered, these items pose virtually no safety risk.  Although unlikely, it is possible that unexploded ordnance (UXO), discarded military munitions (DMM), and munitions constituents (MC) may be encountered.  For safety assurance, in the event any of the later items are encountered, the items should not be handled, and the NOAA Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative (COTR) should be notified.

Contractor Services: The Contractor shall furnish all labor, material and equipment necessary for satisfactory contract performance.  Materials and equipment shall be of a suitable type and grade for the purpose.  All material, workmanship, and equipment shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the appointed NOAA site representative.  The Contractor shall supply NOAA with a list of chemicals to be used and a copy of certified herbicide applicators’ licenses. No contractor equipment or chemicals may be stored on the site overnight.  Specified services shall be completed to provide for the safety of NOAA staff and the general public.

Protection of Property: Precautions shall be exercised at all times for the protection of persons and property while performing work under this contract.  Contractor shall be responsible to repair or replace, to be determined by and to the satisfaction of NOAA, any item(s) damaged or destroyed by actions or omissions of the Contractor and/or related personnel on federal property. 

Coordination and Scheduling of Activities: The Contractor shall coordinate all activities in advance with the designated NOAA site representative.  In addition, the Contractor shall perform site activities only when favorable conditions exist for NOAA to achieve benefit from the activities, and when liabilities associated with the activities and damages to property can be reduced to a minimum.  All activities outlined in the work plan shall be completed within 12 months of the date of contract award. 

Technical questions must be submitted in writing to the Contracting Officer by fax or by e-mail. You may submit your proposal by e-mail, fax, or by mail. Proposals must be received on or before close of business May 31, 2005.

The following evaluation factors will be employed for evaluating each contractor’s submitted work plan for the first year of removing and reducing the growth of exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods on the 10 acre Miami radar site.
1.  Method(s) for treating exotic plant species and non-native hardwoods, and identifying and protecting endangered plant species.  
2.   Qualifications of personnel overseeing and performing the work.  
3.  Management of debris for disposal. 
4.  Required time to fully implement the work plan.

6 		PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

USTDA has identified a number of prospective projects with public and private sector project sponsors in the port sector in Brazil.  The objective of this expanded definitional mission is to help USTDA obtain the additional information needed to complete its due diligence and to help prioritize USTDA investments in the port sector in Brazil.  

USTDA has received expressions of interest in USTDA funding from the federal Ministry of Transportation and from the Espirito Santo Port Authority (Companhia Docas do Espírito Santo, “CODESA”).  Investment in the port sector is a high priority for the Government of Brazil.  Approximately 93% of Brazil’s international trade is moved by ocean freight and the port sector is cited as one of the principal bottlenecks to continued export-led growth.  It is estimated that US$1.6 billion of investment will be required to bring Brazilian ports in line with international standards.

As part of the Brazilian government’s Agenda Portos initiative, Ministry of Transportation is seeking to address operational, institutional, and legal issues that impact the efficiency of the port sector.  The Director of the Department of Water Transportation at the Ministry of Transportation has submitted a preliminary request for funding for technical assistance to develop guidelines for master planning for ports and to address operational bottlenecks at key ports.  The Ministry is preparing supporting documentation, which is expected to be available by the time the DM contract is awarded.

IN addition, the Espírito Santo Port Authority (Companhia Docas do Espírito Santo, “CODESA”) in Vitória, has identified two prospective projects for USTDA funding.  CODESA is seeking to plan investments in environmental infrastructure and controls at the Port of Vitória. In addition, CODESA is studying the viability of expanding the Port of Barra do Riacho, which is located to the north of Vitória. The port primarily serves Aracruz, the Brazilian pulp and paper company; however, the port offers the potential to service the excess demand for service at the Port of Vitória, which faces physical constraints to its ability to expand.  The Port of Barra do Riacho would require new investments in container terminals, petroleum terminals, and general cargo facilities. 

In addition to these public sector projects with the Ministry of Transportation and CODESA, the DM will be utilized to evaluate potential private sector projects.  USTDA has been in contact with private port terminal operators and will provide these contacts and preliminary project information after the award of the DM contract. The scope of this expanded DM is expected to involve reviewing prospective projects prior to and during travel to Brazil, and targeting up to four projects that will be subject to a complete evaluation by the DM consultant.  It is expected that the DM will need to travel to Brasilia for meetings with the Ministry of Transportation, to Vitória to meet with CODESA, and to 1-2 other ports.

Annex I

IMPACT ON U.S. LABOR STATEMENT

The Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations legislation restricts U.S. foreign assistance from being used to provide: (a) any financial incentive to a business enterprise currently located in the United States for the purpose of inducing such an enterprise to relocate outside the United States if such incentive or inducement is likely to reduce the number of employees of such business enterprise in the United States because United States production is being replaced by such enterprise outside the United States; (b) assistance for any project or activity that contributes to the violation of internationally recognized workers rights; and (c) direct assistance for establishing or expanding production of any commodity for export by any country other than the United States, if the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets at the time the resulting productive capacity is expected to become operative and if the assistance will cause substantial injury to United States producers of the same, similar, or competing commodity.

6	          Project Descriptions and Profile

		Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Georgia each play a unique role in the overarching energy dialogue that exists within Central Asia and the Caucasus.  The U.S. Government has been active in voicing its policy of an energy independent Caucasus and Black Sea region that will not only generate economic development and democracy for the region, but also spur greater commercial partnerships with the United States.  For this reason, as well as to protect their own interests politically and economically, these countries have begun to develop plans for and invest in energy infrastructure.     

Specifically, USTDA has received requests for the funding of feasibility studies based on strategic large-scale energy-related capital investments, and capacity building initiatives.  These projects include: development of a new thermal power plant and construction of a new underground gas storage facility in Armenia; construction of a 500Kv transmission line and the rehabilitation of a hydro power plant in Georgia; and modernization of a thermal power plant and commercialization of the Odessa-Brody oil pipeline in Ukraine.  In addition, USTDA has also been asked to explore the possibility of funding technical assistance for a regional electricity-sharing plan.  

Given the importance of the energy sector, one or more of these projects could be impacted by broader U.S. policy issues, which might affect further USTDA involvement.  In view of the number of requests USTDA has received for projects in this particular sector, USTDA believes that the best approach would be to send a DM to investigate each project at a deeper level, to assess their eligibility for USTDA funding.  

This DM will investigate each project at a deeper level, investigate other potential projects, and assess their eligibility for USTDA funding.
