<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT WILL BE AWARDED FROM THIS SYNOPSIS. NO REIMBURSEMENT WILL BE MADE FOR ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING INFORMATION IN RESPONSE TO THIS SYNOPSIS OR ANY FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION REQUESTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYNOPSIS IS TO NOTIFY INDUSTRY OF THE USAF INTENT TO ISSUE A SOLE SOURCE SOLICITATION. PLEASE DO NOT REQUEST A COPY OF A SOLICIATION, AS ONE DOES NOT EXIST.
<p>The 412th Test Wing, Electronic Warfare Group (EWG), Edwards, AFB intends to solicit and award a sole source contract, 5-year IDIQ to Avarint, LLC, 4455 Genesee Street, Buffalo, NY 14225. <br /><br />The resultant contract, called VIEWS II, is planned to support various efforts for the Air Force Digital Integrated Air Defense System (DIADS) Upgrades program at the AFTC, 412 Test Wing, 412 Electronic Warfare Group (EWG), and continue the integration efforts executing under the Advanced Warfare Test and Evaluation Capability (AWTEC) program. The contract will provide for various engineering services, including support for continued development and enhancement activities supporting the DIADS and AWTEC programs. The DIADS and AWTEC programs, together, provide an integrated EW test capability. The objective of the contract services in VIEWS II tasks are to provide increased threat simulator fidelity and threat signal density, as well as to improve efficiencies with regard to real-time test execution; environment monitoring techniques; and data capture, processing, and initial analysis.</p>
<p>Extensive market research efforts have been conducted for this effort. A Sources Sought Synopsis was advertised categorically as DIADS and AWTEC scopes of work. The notice for the proposed acquisition advised industry of the pending acquisition as well as solicited inquiries from interested parties. Eleven candidate companies responded and were evaluated, which included the incumbent, Avarint. The evaluation included teleconferences, questionnaires, and written correspondence that resulted in a qualifying scoring matrix. From this market research, it was assessed that only one contractor, Avarint, was fully qualified for the overall requirement as well as the standalone requirements of DIADS and AWTEC.</p>
<p>In addition to the above market research, the Government considered breaking out those portions of the requirement where competition might be possible. The Government's analysis concluded that the breakout was not a feasible approach to meeting the requirement, nor would significant benefits be gained through competition as compared to the potential duplication of costs by having two contractors perform the requirement. Finally, experience with the current VIEWS contract, where a single contract vehicle has been utilized for the majority of EWG's capability upgrade support, including AWTEC and DIADS, has proven to be most efficient in its execution.</p>
<p>Based upon the results of the market research conducted, and the aforementioned Government analysis, the Government will acquire the services on a sole source basis. The resultant contract will be awarded under the authority of FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy the Agency's Requirements.</p>

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-15-00031 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i) Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold 
(ii) Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE. 
(iii) Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.

<DESC>The purpose of this acquisition is to provide continued product maintenance and support for Formark specific products and applications "Outside, CWA and LLCOM". Formark Outside allows organizations that use Livelink for internal collaboration to also engage clients and partners anywhere in the world. The Formark application extracts only the Livelink functions used by a project and creates a "padded cell" web application that makes it easy for external clients and partners to do valid interactions with Livelink while hiding all the capabilities of Livelink that they don't need and shouldn't touch. In addition, ONR/CIO is using Formark's unique LLCOM technology, which puts a high-level Microsoft COM object wrapper around Livelink's standard API.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Contracts Department (AIR 2.5.1.3), Patuxent River, MD is posting this Sources Sought to determine the interest in this requirement and announces its intention to procure on a competitive basis the services necessary to provide support to NAWCAD Special Communications Requirements (SCR) Division (4.11.4), for Operational and Maintenance support for various Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR) Electronic Systems and Subsystems (ES).</p>
<p><br />C4ISR ES - ACQUISITION HISTORY</p>
<p>This procurement was previously synopsized in the Seaport-e portal to all eligible Zone 2 business firms in November 2012. Capability statements were requested via the Seaport-e portal from all Zone 2, large and small businesses interested in the procurement in December 2012.</p>
<p>NAWCAD hosted an Industry Day providing a presentation explaining the technical nature of the requirement and a tour of the systems that will be covered under this effort at Webster Field, St. Inigoes on 12 December 2012. Attendance at the Industry Day was not a requirement and in no way affects any company from submitting a response to this Sources Sought notice and/or a proposal in response to any forthcoming solicitation. Information provided at the Industry Day included a PowerPoint presentation and a tour of a local on-base facility. A list of attendees and the PowerPoint presentation provided is available for review in this notice. These documents are in draft form and should not be utilized for planning/preparation purposes. The Government does not intend to host another Industry Day.</p>
<p>The Government uploaded a draft RFP (N00024-13-R-3031) including a draft copy of Exhibit A - CDRLs and Attachment 3 - OCI List into the Seaport-e portal in September 2013 and requested feedback/comments from Industry. Fourteen (14) questions were received and the Government provided responses to the questions. A copy of the draft RFP (N00024-13-R-3031) including a draft copy of Exhibit A - CDRLs and Attachment 3 - OCI List along with the questions and answers that were posted in the Seaport-e portal are available for review in this notice. These documents are in draft form and should not be utilized for planning/preparation purposes.</p>
<p>The Government's acquisition strategy has changed and now the Government intends to procure these services outside of Seaport-e and is interested in determining if any additional small or large businesses are interested in the C4ISR ES procurement. All large and small businesses that are interested should send in a capability statement. OFFERORS WHO PREVIOUSLY RESPONDED NEED NOT RESPOND. This Sources Sought is a market research tool and the results will be used to determine potential sources.</p>
<p>The attached Draft Performance Work Statement (PWS) provides additional information about the required tasking. If your company has any questions about the structure of the PWS, or areas that may need further definition, please also identify those in the response.</p>
<p>Since the resultant contract will be a cost-type effort, the successful awardee will also be required to have a Government-approved accounting system upon contract award.<br /><br />The results of the Sources Sought will be utilized to determine if any Small Business Set-Aside opportunities exist. All Small Business Set-Aside categories will be considered. This Sources Sought will also be utilized to identify that adequate competition exists among large businesses if this is not a Small Business Set-Aside.</p>

<a href="mailto:william.r.jensen1.civ@mail.mil">PEO STRI Acquisition Center</a>
<DESC>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: <br>  <br> The U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI), Project Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), Product Manager for Combat Training Instrumentation Systems (CTIS) has a validated requirement to field an additional 1254 PRTLS radios and associated accessories to the U.S. Army's JMRC at Hohenfels, Germany.  A CTIS project team fielded the additional 900 PRTLS radios and modified the communications network at the JMRC in 2012. The existing Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) communications infrastructure at JMRC required that only certain radio technology be employed to meet technical requirements of this infrastructure and to comply with German spectrum requirements. In short, the PRTLS radio for JMRC is a unique device which is only used at JRMC.  The field radio was manufactured by Sepura PLC, who was able to cost effectively adapt (tailor firmware) one of its existing products to satisfy the JMRC PRTLS requirement. <br>  <br> This procurement of 1254 radios and accessories must also employ the same non-standard, TETRA-based radio architecture, operating on the appropriate radio frequencies (366 MHz to 371 MHz), that is tailored to operate on and be compatible with the existing JMRC communications infrastructure and training environment. It must already be approved, via the JF-12 process, by the German National Radio Frequency Office (NARFA) and meet U.S. Army safety requirements by possessing a safety confirmation.   The PRTLS radios will be required to have firmware and software installed to be compatible with the existing instrumentation system.    <br>  <br> These PRTLS radios are an integral part of the  JMRC Instrumentation System (JMRC-IS) which collects, processes, displays, and stores training performance data from Soldiers performing live, collective training at the JMRC.  The PRTLS radios perform an essential function in these training exercises by collecting training data from vehicles and dismounted Soldiers and relaying that information to the Core of the JMRC-IS for use in monitoring the training exercise and providing After Action Review (AAR) feedback to the Soldiers in training.   <br>  <br> The following list identifies the type, quantities, components and capabilities of the required PRTLS capability: <br>    <br> (1)  1254 JMRC Instrumentation System-compatible radios <br> (2)  1254 antennas <br> (3)  3752 high capacity batteries <br> (4)  38   high-capacity, 24-way battery chargers <br> (5)  1254 protective radio pouches (for dismounted Soldiers) <br> (6)  One-year radio and antenna warranty; options for two and three additional years. <br>  <br> The technical requirements for the PRTLS radios and accessories are: <br>  <br> (1)  Radio requirements: <br> 		 <br> a)	Approved by the National Radio Frequency Agency (NARFA) for use in Germany <br> b)	Enhanced Global Positioning System (GPS) with integrated option of -182 dBw acquisition sensitivity and 185 dBw tracking sensitivity. GPS reporting type:  Location Information Protocol (LIP) Short <br> c)	Operates in frequency band:  366.275 MHz - 371.250 MHz <br> d)	Man Down License:   (GPS) Motion <br> e)	Tuning Increment is 6.2500 KHz <br> f)	Capability to centrally adjust the reporting rate (distance and time) from 1-180 seconds.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.  This is not a request for proposals.  A solicitation will not be issued at this time.  The Department of Veterans Affairs, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) 18 has a requirement for Durable Medical Equipment Services.  The intent of the procurement is to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract (IDIQ).   The Statement of Work (SOW) defines the effort required for the setup, installation, and management of Durable Medical Equipment, in accordance with Joint Commission (JC) standards, to Veteran beneficiaries serviced by VISN 18.  The SOW includes the associated program management, human engineering, and logistic support planning requirements.  

The acquisition of Durable Medical Equipment services is being initiated to provide Durable Medical Equipment services to Veteran beneficiaries serviced by VISN 18.  VISN 18 does not have the capacity to provide these services so a contract has been sought for the provision of durable medical equipment and all associated products and services.  All services shall be performed in the veteran's place of residence or in a nursing home housing the veteran.  The area of service shall be all patients serviced by VISN 18, including catchment areas, regardless of where Patient resides.  The equipment needs are subject to change as determined by the prescribing physician.  Contractors shall have a facility or resources physically located in the geographic area in which they shall provide service.  Non-territory requests will be required from time to time and the Contractor shall accept these "non-territory" veterans at that Contractor's awarded price.  VA reserves the right to assign these Patients to any contractor.  The geographical boundaries described herein have been determined as the areas of responsibility/jurisdiction for each VA Health Care System (VAHCS).

For each listed VAHCS, Contractor shall provide setup, installation, and management of Durable Medical Equipment and/or Ventilation services to any Patient that are treated at the main HCS Medical Center (VAMC) and all Community Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs) and Outpatient Clinics (OCs) supported therein (Clinic of Jurisdiction/Primary Service Area COJ/PSA), regardless of their physical location.  The listing of counties in the PSA for each VAHCS does not exclude the provision of services in other counties.  This includes Patients who reside near bordering state's catchment areas but prefer to be seen by a VISN 18 VAHCS.  Some counties are served by more than one VAHCS.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
<p>This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />The Indian Health Service (IHS) develops and supports a comprehensive integrated health information system of systems which supports a broad range of clinical and business functions at IHS, Tribal and Urban (I/T/U) hospitals and clinics across the country. The Resource and Patient Management System (RPMS) is similar to the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) in use at the Veterans Administration, having been derived from the same legacy system and sharing many of the same infrastructure and business applications. The RPMS as currently deployed has a MUMPS (Intersystems Cache) database architecture and VA FileMan file structures. A number of graphical user interface (GUI) applications utilizing various languages ranging from Delphi to C# .NET have been developed to support certain business processes, while other applications retain legacy character-based interfaces. RPMS GUI applications principally use a two-tiered architecture utilizing broker-based remote procedure calls, although recent development has focused on a three-tier architecture using web services. For more information on the portfolio of supported applications, visit: http://www.ihs.gov/RPMS/ <br />Business functions supported by the RPMS include, but are not limited to, practice management (e.g. patient registration, scheduling, billing and accounts receivable, release of information), ancillary clinical applications (e.g. inpatient and outpatient pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, image archiving, consults and referrals), and point of care clinical applications for behavioral health, inpatient and ambulatory care. The RPMS is certified as a Complete Electronic Health Record for inpatient and ambulatory settings according to the 2014 version certification criteria published by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. In recent years, the system has been extended to include a personal health record system, Direct secure messaging, a health information exchange (HIE) service, and supporting middleware services. In recent years the architecture and complexity of IHS health IT systems as well as their criticality to health care operations have become an impetus for IHS to re-evaluate its current approach to software development.<br />This Sources Sought Notice seeks to identify companies that have capability to provide full lifecycle software development, architecture, and operations support services to assist IHS with evolving the RPMS, as well as the software lifecycle programs and processes around the system, to align with current best practices in application architecture, design and management. The IHS strategy includes improvements in data modeling and mapping, transition to a true service-oriented architecture (SOA), and harmonization of disparate GUIs into a common interface framework compliant with accessibility and usability best practices in a platform-independent context (i.e. support for Web, mobile, machine, and other ancillary interfaces). IHS also seeks to continuously mature its governance model, project and portfolio management, system development life cycle, security integration, and software quality assurance processes.<br />While IHS is not specifying a specific SDLC, understanding the capabilities of an organization's proven methodology is critical. IHS is particularly interested in identifying sources that have successfully implemented and adopted a methodology that is akin to the Scaled Agile&reg; Framework or the Enterprise Unified Process. The reason for interest in this type of methodology is the need to support iterative development practices in a large, regulated, federal, health care environment.<br />The projected scope of this requirement is estimated to reach $125 million over (5) years. Interested small businesses, with a high level of expertise and demonstrable past performance compatible with the IHS objectives described above are invited to submit capability statements.

<DESC>The Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District is soliciting comments from the construction community addressing the potential use of Project Labor Agreements (PLA) for large scale construction projects (exceeding $25 million) within the state of Nevada to include Nellis Air Force Base. A PLA is defined as a pre-hire collective bargaining agreement with one or more labor organizations that establishes the terms and conditions of employment for a specific construction project and is an agreement described in 29 U.S.C. 158(f). Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Policy:  <br>  <br> (a) A Project Labor Agreement (PLA) is a tool that agencies may use to promote economy and efficiency in Federal procurement. Pursuant to Executive Order 13502, agencies are encouraged to consider requiring the use of project labor agreements in connection with large-scale construction projects.  <br>  <br> (b) An agency may, if appropriate, require that every contractor and subcontractor engaged in construction on the project agree, for that project, to negotiate or become a party to a project labor agreement with one or more labor organizations if the agency decides that the use of project labor agreements will  <br>  <br> (1) Advance the Federal Governments interest in achieving economy and efficiency in Federal procurement, producing labor-management stability, and ensuring compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards, and other matters; and  <br> (2) Be consistent with law. Reference: Provision: 52.222-33 Notice of Requirement for Project Labor Agreement Clause 52.222-34 Project Labor Agreement. <br>  <br> Please provide responses to any or all of the following questions: <br>  <br> (1) Should PLAs be executed on selected large dollar, large scale military construction contracts at Nellis Air Force Base? If yes, describe how a PLA will achieve economy and efficiency in the procurement, produce labor management stability, and/or ensure compliance with laws and regulations governing safety and health, equal employment opportunity, labor and employment standards? If no, describe why? <br>  <br> (2) Are there concerns by prime contractors on the availability of skilled construction labor? <br>  <br> (3) Would a PLA benefit a project which contains a unique and compelling mission-critical schedule? How? <br>  <br> (4) What type of project should not be considered for PLA clauses? <br>  <br> (5) What is the time impact to the completion of the contract due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (6) What is the cost impact to the bid/proposal due to a PLA? <br>  <br> (7) What other factors should the Corps consider before deciding to include PLA provisions in a Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District contract? <br>  <br>  <br> Please limit your responses to no more than two (2) to three (3) pages in length.

<SOLNBR>RPSOFL-INLNASSAU-FY15-001
<RESPDATE>112714
<CONTACT>Juan M. Fernandez, Email FernandezJM@state.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of State, Regional Procurement Support Office Fort Lauderdale, intends to purchase two (2) SAFE Boats International Apostle 41-Feet T-Top Interceptor vessels in support of Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), U.S. Embassy Nassau programs. Vessel specifications are attached.<br /><br />The same vessels were previously designed and acquired for use of the Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF). The current purchase is to expand the existing fleet of SAFE Boat International interceptors serving the RBPF. The U.S. Department of State does not anticipate purchasing additional vessels for the RBPF.<br /><br />It is not practical, nor in the Government's best interest, for INL to support a mixed fleet for the RBPF for the following reasons:<br /><br />1.	INL has already procured two SAFE Boats for The Bahamas, and the ability to procure two additional SAFE Boats will facilitate capacity-building and maintenance, as host nation counterparts will only need to learn maintenance procedures for one type of boat, vice multiple different models. Procurement of SAFE Boats will enable the significant U.S. Government investment in the Caribbean Technical Assistance Field Team to focus its efforts on maintenance capacity-building for one type of boat, rather than multiple models, maximizing the resources.<br /><br />2.	The purchase of SAFE Boats is required to ensure compatibility with current boat lifts and equipment owned by RBPF. Two boat lifts in Freeport are specific to SAFE Boats. The distance between the poles and the cradle system and support bunks are specific to SAFE Boats. The capacity of the lift and the boarding steps were designed specifically for SAFE Boats. Standardizing with SAFE Boats will allow for reutilization of existing resources.<br /><br />3.	Existing bench stock items, repair and replacement parts. Standardizing on a single platform allows parts that are being stocked to be shipped quickly to any island to get a boat back in service with minimal delay if/when repairs are needed. As a country with over 700 islands and cays, this is incredibly important. Non-standard vessels require extra maintenance, and when they break down, they are out of service for long periods of time, because nonstandard parts need to be ordered from abroad. By comparison, the current SAFE Boats have only ever been out of service for a maximum of one week at a time.<br /><br />4.	Standardizing on a single platform assures utilization of common troubleshooting systems and knowledge, which in turn translates to lower training and maintenance costs. Standardizing on a single platform allows better utilization of RBPF Marine Support Unit Officers who have already been trained in the maintenance of SAFE Boats. There are approximately 20 Marine Support Unit Officers split between two bases, one in Freeport to cover the Northern Bahamas and one in Nassau to cover Central Bahamas. With a single type vessel fleet, the RBPF can move their limited Marine Support Services officers around from base to base without the officers having to go through any learning curves or having to learn different maintenance requirements on individual vessels.<br /><br />5.	Standardizing on a single vessel establishes a single warranty source and process. The RBPF has formed a relationship with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which allows them to amend the SAFE Boat maintenance agreement to service RBPF vessels at the U.S. Customs National Marine Center in Fort Lauderdale. This has considerable cost savings advantages, as the cost to ship the vessel back to a factory for warranty and service work could be prohibitive.<br /><br />6.	Crew safety. Standardizing on a single platform guarantees commonality in operational training for RBPF officers and performance characteristics of the vessel.<br /><br />7.	SAFE Boats contain a patented foam flotation collar (US Patents 5,282,436; 5,647,297; and 5,870,965) which greatly increases the safety of the crew. The collar allows for the continued floatation of the vessel in the event of a catastrophic hull failure. RBPF interceptor boats usually operate without air support or other support vessels. As such, the secondary hard-foam flotation is an operational necessity.<br /><br />This notice is not a request for quotations and no solicitation is available. This acquisition will be conducted under the authority of FAR 13.501(a).  A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on responses received is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br /><br />Questions must be submitted via email to FernandezJM@state.gov no later than 9:00 AM Eastern Time on November 27, 2014. Telephone calls regarding this notice will not be accepted.<br /><br />The Government will not pay for any cost incurred in responding to this notice. Any information submitted in response to this notice is strictly voluntary.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with (IAW) the format in Federal Acquisition Requirements (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This acquisition will use Simplified Acquisition Methods in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.3. This announcement, with its attachments, constitutes the only solicitation; offers are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Contract financing is NOT provided for in this acquisition. The Government intends to make one (1) award pursuant to this solicitation to the offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation requirements, represents the best value to the Government, price and other factors considered. The Government intends to award without discussions and the Government reserves the right to make no award at all depending upon the quality of offers received.
<p>Solicitation Number: The solicitation number for this requirement is FA8601-15-T-0016.</p>
<p>Set-Aside: This acquisition utilizes full and open competition. The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 339113 - Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>Requirement: The Wright-Patterson AFB Medical Treatment Facility (MTF) requires Aquamantys 6.0 bipolar sealers for use in surgeries performed at the MTF. Supplies are to be provided in accordance with the Specifications dated 10 October 2014, which is located at Attachment 1.</p>
<p>The Contracting Officer (CO) has determined that a Pre-Priced Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) is the most appropriate method for procuring this requirement. A BPA is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing "charge accounts" with qualified sources of supply. Supplies or services are ordered by placing calls against the BPA by personnel authorized by the CO to make such calls. The contractor provides the supplies or performs the services covered under the BPA IAW the BPA Terms of Agreement at the prices on the price list approved by the CO. The contractor submits price lists for the CO's approval, which are valid for a specific period of time (normally one year); i.e. 1 Dec 2014 through 30 Nov 2015.

In the event of termination for cause, the Government shall not be liable to the Contractor for any amount for supplies or services not accepted, and the Contractor shall be liable to the Government for any and all rights and remedies provided by law. If it is determined that the Government improperly terminated this contract for default, such termination shall be deemed a termination for convenience. <br />(n) Title.

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.<br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the SAM database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer.

Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.<br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov.<br />(u) Unauthorized Obligations.

If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause.<br />(iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.<br />(2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br />(End of clause)<br />52.216-18 Ordering. <br />ORDERING (OCT 1995) <br />(a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule.

<p><br />52.218-000 CONTINUING CONTRACT PERFORMANCE DURING A PANDEMIC INFLUENZA OR OTHER NATIONAL EMERGENCY (MAY 2008)<br />During a pandemic or other emergency we understand that our contractor workforce will experience the same high levels of absenteeism as our federal employees. Although the Excusable Delays and Termination for Default clauses used in Government contracts list epidemics and quarantine restrictions among the reasons to excuse delays in contract performance, we expect our contractors to make a reasonable effort to keep performance at an acceptable level during emergency periods.<br />The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has provided guidance to federal managers and employees on the kinds of actions to be taken to ensure the continuity of operations during emergency periods. This guidance is also applicable to our contract workforce. Contractors are expected to have reasonable policies in place for continuing work performance, particularly those performing mission critical services, during a pandemic influenza or other emergency situation.<br />The types of actions a federal contractor should reasonably take to help ensure performance are:<br />&bull; Encourage employees to get inoculations or follow other preventative measures as advised by the public health service.<br />&bull; Cross-train workers as backup for all position performing critical services. This is particularly important for work such as guard services where telework is not an option.<br />&bull; Implement telework to the greatest extent possible in the workgroup so systems are in place to support successful remote work in an emergency.<br />&bull; Communicate expectations to all employees regarding their roles and responsibilities in relation to remote work in the event of a pandemic health crisis or emergency.<br />&bull; Establish communication processes to notify employees of activation of this plan.<br />&bull; Integrate pandemic health crisis response expectations into telework agreements.<br />&bull; With the employee, assess requirements for working at home (supplies and equipment needed for an extended telework period). Security concerns should be considered in making equipment choices; agencies or contractors may wish to avoid use of employees personal computers and provide them with PCs or laptops as appropriate.<br />&bull; Determine how all employees who may telework will communicate with one another and with management to accomplish work.<br />&bull; Practice telework regularly to ensure effectiveness.<br />&bull; Make it clear that in emergency situations, employees must perform all duties assigned by management, even if they are outside usual or customary duties.<br />&bull; Identify how time and attendance will be maintained.<br />It is the contractor's responsibility to advise the Government Contracting Officer if they anticipate not being able to perform and to work with the Department to fill gaps as necessary. This means direct communication with the Contracting Officer or in his/her absence, another responsible person in the contracting office via telephone or email messages acknowledging the contractor's notification. The incumbent contractor is responsible for assisting the Department in estimating the adverse impacts of nonperformance and to work diligently with the Department to develop a strategy for maintaining the continuity of operations.

<p>1. Long-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />In order to be compliant with HSPD-12/PIV I, the following investigative requirements must be met for each new long-term 2 contractor employee whose background investigation (BI) process begins on or after October 27, 2005:</p>
<p>a. Contractor Personnel must present two forms of identification in original form prior to badge issuance (acceptable documents are listed in Form I-9, OMB No. 1615-0047, "Employment Eligibility Verification," and at least one document must be a valid State or Federal government-issued picture ID);<br />b. Contractor Personnel must appear in person at least once before a DOJ official who is responsible for checking the identification documents. This identity proofing must be completed sometime during the clearance process but prior to badge issuance and must be documented by the DOJ official;<br />c. Contractor Personnel must undergo a BI commensurate with the designated risk level associated with the duties of each position. Outlined below are the minimum BI requirements for each risk level:<br />&bull; High Risk - Background Investigation (5 year scope)<br />&bull; Moderate Risk - Limited Background Investigation (LBI) or Minimum Background Investigation (MBI)<br />&bull; Low Risk - National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI) investigation<br />d. The pre-appointment BI waiver requirements for all position sensitivity levels are a: <br />1) Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />2) Favorable fingerprint results; <br />3) Favorable credit report, if required;3 <br />4) Waiver request memorandum, including both the Office of Personnel Management schedule date and position sensitivity/risk level; and <br />5) Favorable review of the National Agency Check (NAC) 4 portion of the applicable BI that is determined by position sensitivity/risk level. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements.</p>
<p>If the NAC is not received within five days of OPM's scheduling date, the badge can be issued based on a favorable review of the Security Questionnaire and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal History Check (i.e., fingerprint check results). <br />e. Badge re-validation will occur once the investigation is completed and favorably adjudicated. If the BI results so justify, badges issued under these procedures will be suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>2. Short-Term Contractor Personnel: <br />It is the policy of the DOJ that short-term contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or fewer are subject to the identity proofing requirements listed in items 1a. and 1b. above. The pre-appointment waiver requirements for short-term contractors are: <br />a. Favorable review of the security questionnaire form; <br />b. Favorable fingerprint results; <br />c. Favorable credit report, if required; and <br />d. Waiver request memorandum indicating both the position sensitivity/risk level and the duration of the appointment. The commensurate BI does not need to be initiated. <br />A badge may be issued following approval of the above waiver requirements and the badge will expire six months from the date of issuance. This process can only be used once for a short-term contractor in a twelve month period. This will ensure that any consecutive short-term appointments are subject to the full PIV-I identity proofing process. <br />For example, if a contractor employee requires daily access for a three or four-week period, this contractor would be cleared according to the above short-term requirements. However, if a second request is submitted for the same contractor employee within a twelve-month period for the purpose of extending the initial contract or for employment under a totally different contract for another three or four-week period, this contractor would now be considered "long-term" and must be cleared according to the long-term requirements as stated in this interim policy. <br />3. Intermittent Contractors:<br />An exception to the above-mentioned short-term requirements would be intermittent contractors. <br />a. For purposes of this policy, "intermittent" is defined as those contractor employees needing access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for a maximum of one day per week, regardless of the duration of the required intermittent access. For example, the water delivery contractor that delivers water one time each week and is working on a one-year contract. <br />b. Contractors requiring intermittent access should follow the Department's escort policy. Please reference the August 11, 2004, and January 29, 2001, Department Security Officer policy memoranda that conveys the requirements for contractor facility escorted access. <br />c. Due to extenuating circumstances, if a component requests unescorted access or DOJ IT system access for an intermittent contractor, the same pre-employment background investigation waiver requirements that apply to short-term contractors are required. <br />d. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the contractor will only be issued a daily badge. The daily badge will be issued upon entrance into a DOJ facility or space and must be returned upon exiting the same facility or space.<br />e. If an intermittent contractor is approved for unescorted access, the approval will not exceed one year. If the intermittent contractor requires unescorted access beyond one year, the contractor will need to be re-approved each year.</p>
<p>4. An individual transferring from another department or agency shall not be re-adjudicated provided the individual has a current (within the last five years), favorably adjudicated BI meeting HSPD-12 and DOJ's BI requirements. <br />5. The DOJ's current escorted contractor policy remains unchanged by this acquisition notice. <br />Notes:<br />1. FIPS 201 is available at: www.csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips201/FIPS-201-022505.pdf<br />2. Under HSPD-12, long-term contractors are contractors having access to DOJ information systems and/or DOJ facilities or space for six months or longer. The PIV-I identity proofing process, including initiation and adjudication of the required background investigation, is required for all new long-term contractors regardless of whether it is the current practice to issue a badge. The second phase of HSPD-12 implementation (PIV-II) requires badge issuance to all affected long-term contractors. <br />3. For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />4. In order to avoid a delay in the hiring process, components should request an Advance NAC Report when initiating investigations to OPM. Per OPM ' s instructions, to obtain an Advance NAC Report, a Code " 3" must be placed in block " B " of the " Agency Use Only " section of the investigative form. This report is available for all case types.<br />5.For contractors in position sensitivity/risk levels above level 1, a favorable review of a credit check is required as part of the pre-appointment waiver package. <br />[End of Clause]</p>

<p>The following clauses are addenda to FAR 52.212-4 - Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items incorporated in full text:<br /><br />FAR 52.211-9 - DESIRED AND REQUIRED TIME OF DELIVERY (JUN 1997)<br />(a) The Government desires delivery to be made according to the following schedule:<br /><br />DESIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br /><br />ITEM NO., QUANTITY, WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br /><br />CLINS 0001-0004, AS SPECIFIED IN SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES, 21 days.<br /><br />CLIN 0005, AS SPECIFIED IN SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES, Within 21 days after the date of a unilateral modification to the contract.</p>
<p>If the offeror is unable to meet the desired delivery schedule, it may, without prejudicing evaluation of its offer, propose a delivery schedule below. However, the offeror's proposed delivery schedule must not extend the delivery period beyond the time for delivery in the Government's required delivery schedule as follows:<br /><br />REQUIRED DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br /><br />ITEM NO., QUANTITY, WITHIN DAYS AFTER DATE OF CONTRACT<br /><br />CLINS 0001-0004, AS SPECIFIED IN SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES, 35 DAYS.<br /><br />CLIN 0005, AS SPECIFIED IN SCHEDULE OF SUPPLIES, Within 21 days after the date of a unilateral modification to the contract.</p>
<p>Offers that propose delivery of a quantity under such terms or conditions that delivery will not clearly fall within the applicable required delivery period specified above, will be considered nonresponsive and rejected. If the offeror proposes no other delivery schedule, the desired delivery schedule above will apply.<br /><br />OFFEROR'S PROPOSED DELIVERY SCHEDULE:<br /><br />CLINS 0001-0004 WITHIN __________ DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF ORDER.<br /><br />CLIN 0005 WITHIN __________ DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF A UNILATERAL MODIFICATION TO THE CONTRACT.<br /><br />(b) Attention is directed to the Contract Award provision of the solicitation that provides that a written award or acceptance of offer mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror results in a binding contract. The Government will mail or otherwise furnish to the offeror an award or notice of award not later than the day the award is dated. Therefore, the offeror shall compute the time available for performance beginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from the Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that proposes delivery based on the Contractor's date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding (1) five calendar days for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails, or (2) one working day if the solicitation states that the contract or notice of award will be transmitted electronically. (The term "working day" excludes weekends and U.S. Federal holidays.) If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is later than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>FAR 52.211-16 -- Variation in Quantity (Apr 1984)<br />(a) A variation in the quantity of any item called for by this contract will not be accepted unless the variation has been caused by conditions of loading, shipping, or packing, or allowances in manufacturing processes, and then only to the extent, if any, specified in paragraph (b) of this clause.<br />(b) The permissible variation shall be limited to:<br />10 Percent increase<br />10 Percent decrease<br />This increase or decrease shall apply to contract line item quantities specified in the delivery schedule. Shipments within the 10% clause must be in full unit of issue quantities.<br />(End of Clause)</p>
<p>FAR 52.211-17 -- Delivery of Excess Quantities (Sep 1989)<br />The Contractor is responsible for the delivery of each item quantity within allowable variations, if any. If the Contractor delivers and the Government receives quantities of any item in excess of the quantity called for (after considering any allowable variation in quantity), such excess quantities will be treated as being delivered for the convenience of the Contractor. The Government may retain such excess quantities up to $250 in value without compensating the Contractor therefor, and the Contractor waives all right, title, or interests therein. Quantities in excess of $250 will, at the option of the Government, either be returned at the Contractor's expense or retained and paid for by the Government at the contract unit price. **NOTE: VENDORS ARE CAUTIONED IN THE USE OF A QUANTITY VARIANCE. DLA'S CURRENT PAYMENT SYSTEM RECOGNIZES NEITHER PARTIAL QUANTITIES NOR A QUANTITY IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUM VARIANCE PERCENTAGE SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT. THEREFORE, A QUANTITY VARIANCE NEEDS TO BE ROUNDED DOWN RATHER THAN UP IN ORDER TO BE PAID PROPERLY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF A VENDOR IS ALLOWED A PLUS OR MINUS 10% VARIANCE ON A QUANTITY OF 199, THE SYSTEM WILL ONLY ALLOW PAYMENT ON AN ADDITIONAL QUANTITY OF 19 OR LESS, NOT 20 (199 x .10 = 19.9). ADDITIONAL QUANTITIES IN EXCESS OF THE MAXIMUM VARIANCE MAY NOT BE ACCEPTED AND MAY BE RETRUNED TO THE CONTRACTOR AT THEIR EXPENSE.<br />(End of Clause)</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

<p>(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition as follows:<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the<br />responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />Factor A -- APPROACH AND CAPABILITIES - Offerors will be evaluated based on their corporate and individual qualifications to perform the work; adequacy of equipment, materials and facilities proposed; and experience with the types of operations identified in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor B -- PAST PERFORMANCE -- Performance by the quoter and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to all solicitation requirements will be evaluated. The evaluation will include the quality of supplies and services previously performed, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction and indication of ability to improve performance through proactive management.

The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>(x) The quoter must submit a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (MAY 2014), with its quote.<br /><br />(xi) The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAY 2014), applies to this acquisition.<br /><br />(xii) The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (JUL 2014) applies to this acquisition.<br /><br />The following clauses under subparagraph (b) apply: (4), (8), (10), (25), (28), (30), (31), (42), (46) and (52). The following clauses under subparagraph (c) apply: none<br /><br />(xiii) The following additional clauses are also applicable to this acquisition: Department of Commerce Clauses: <br />1352.201-70 CONTRACTING OFFICER'S AUTHORITY<br /><br />The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price.</p>
<p>1352.209-73 COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAWS (APR 2010)<br />The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract.<br /><br />1352.209-74 ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST (APR 2010)<br />(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors:<br />(1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and<br />(2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract.<br />(b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as "contractor") in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both.<br />(c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract.<br />(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms "contract," "contractor," and "Contracting Officer" shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights.<br />(f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver. <br />The following additional terms and conditions apply: <br /><br />52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)</p>
<p>The Government may require continued performance of any services within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. These rates may be adjusted only as a result of revisions to prevailing labor rates provided by the Secretary of Labor. The option provision may be exercised more than once, but the total extension of performance hereunder shall not exceed 6 months. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option by written notice to the Contractor within 10 days of expiration.</p>
<p>(End of Clause)<br /><br />52.217-9 OPTION TO EXTEND THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT (MAR 2000)</p>
<p>(a) The Government may extend the term of this contract by written notice to the Contractor any time prior to contract expiration; provided that the Government gives the Contractor a preliminary written notice of its intent to extend at least 10 days before the contract expires. The preliminary notice does not commit the Government to an extension.<br />(b) If the Government exercises this option, the extended contract shall be considered to include this option clause.<br />(c) The total duration of this contract, including the exercise of any options under this clause, shall not exceed 5 years.<br />(End of Clause)<br /><br />52.232-39 UNENFORCEABILITY OF UNAUTHORIZED OBLIGATIONS (JUN 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: <br />(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. <br />(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br /><br />52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEC 2013)</p>
<p>(a) Upon receipt of accelerated payments from the Government, the Contractor shall make accelerated payments to its small business subcontractors under this contract, to the maximum extent practicable and prior to when such payment is otherwise required under the applicable contract or subcontract, after receipt of a proper invoice and all other required documentation from the small business subcontractor.</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>November 14, 2014, through November 13, 2015</p>
<p>(viii) The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items (APR 2014), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (OCT 2014), applies to this acquisition. The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. Additionally, FAR 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options (JUL 1990), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(x) Offerors are to include a completed copy of the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (NOV 2014), with its offer or acknowledge its listing in the System for Award Management (SAM) website.</p>
<p>(xi) The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (MAY 2014), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xii) The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (OCT 2014), applies to this acquisition. The Contracting Officer has indicated the following clauses listed in paragraph (b) as applicable and are hereby incorporated by reference: (4) 52.204-10, Reporting Executive Compensation and First-Tier Subcontract Awards (JUL 2013); (8) 52.209-6, Protecting the Government's Interest When Subcontracting with Contractors Debarred, Suspended, or Proposed for Debarment (AUG 2013); (14) 52.219-6, Notice of Total Small Business Aside; (22) 52.219-28, Post Award Small Business Program Rerepresentation; (25) 52.222-3, Convict Labor (JUN 2003); (27) 52.222-21, Prohibition of Segregated Facilities (FEB 1999); (28) 52.222-26, Equal Opportunity (MAR 2007); (30) 52.222-36, Affirmative Action for Workers With Disabilities (OCT 2010); (30) 52.222-36, Equal Opportunity for Workers with Disabilities; (39) 52.223-18, Encouraging Contractor Policies to Ban Text Messaging While Driving (AUG 2011); and (49) 52.232-33, Payment by Electronic Funds Transfer - System for Award Management (JUL 2013).</p>
<p>(xiii) Brand Name Justification - The HHS Office of the Secretary, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs (ASPA) is the HHS leader for the dissemination of health-related information and is responsible for managing several high-level social media channels that provide sensitive information to the public regarding the Secretary's Twitter and Facebook accounts, as well as several priority websites such as Flu.gov, Foodsafety.gov, and Mentalhealth.gov.</p>
<p>ASPA requires specific types of data to be available when engaging and monitoring social media accounts to determine the appropriate messaging of health-related information with the American public. In order to obtain this data, ASPA requires a social media monitoring tool that provides standard functionality (web platform, unlimited accounts, help support, data tagging) as well as some unique characteristics, as described below.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard functionality characteristics, ASPA requires a tool that enables staff to provide analysis and data mining of all social media-related activities related to a query, topic, phrases, program, etc., without any limitations based on the volume of data. Most tools require a cost increase for access to a specific number of "mentions" or "queries" which in turn are used to enable data mining and analysis by the tool.</p>
<p>Hootsuite uberVU is unique because it offers analysis of all social media-related activities through an algorithm that does not require viewing of all social media "mentions" by the user. Instead, its algorithm uses a sampling to provide for holistic reporting of sentiment, demographics, geographic data, and other characteristics on any query/key term/mention to make informed predictions about locations and demographics.</p>
<p>Hootsuite uberVU also provides for additional refinements and contextual information for the analysis and reporting of social media activity to include geo-based location and gender-based information. This feature allows ASPA to measure the effectiveness of its outreach efforts in a particular city/state and with specific targeted audiences. Competitors of uberVU use only user profile data and tagging of a post by account owners.</p>
<p>Finally, Hootsuite uberVU provides automated reporting and allows federal staff to customize the thresholds for each report - it does not set one parameter for all reports. These reports are distributed to stakeholders who may not have access to the tool, such as high-level HHS staff leadership, White House personnel, or Congressional members who are interested in specific topics. Hootsuite uberVU does not require account ownership to be established to view reports, thereby allowing federal staff to easily distribute reports to external stakeholders as necessary.</p>
<p>(xiv) The clauses at FAR 52.232-40, Providing Accelerated Payment to Small Business Subcontractors (DEC 2013); HHSAR 352.203-70, Anti-Lobbying (MAR 2012); and HHSAR 352.222-70, Contractor Cooperation in Equal Employment Opportunity Investigations (JAN 2010), apply to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(xv) DPAS - N/A</p>
<p>(xvi) Quotes are due on November 14, 2014, 1:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, electronically to the Contract Specialist at khristine.agnello@psc.hhs.gov.</p>
<p>(xvii) Contact Khristine Agnello, Contract Specialist, at 301-443-3924 or khristine.agnello@psc.hhs.gov regarding the solicitation. Any inquiries must be emailed to the Contract Specialist, with "OS144814 - Inquiries" in the subject line.</p>

<CONTACT>Donald Downey, CONTRACTING OFFICER, Phone (303) 236-9331, Email ddowney@usgs.gov
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A PRE-SOLICITATION. This is a combined synopsis/solicitation. This Solicitation Notice is to announce the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has a requirement for the 2-D seismic reflection data from the area of interest in accordance with the attached solicitation. The solicitation number is G15PS00024 and is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ). The policies contained in FAR Part 13, in conjunction with the policies and procedures for solicitation, evaluation and award. This is a 100% Small Business Set-aside. The associated NAICS code is 519190 Other Information Services (Small Business Size Standard $27.5 M). A copy of this solicitation may be accessed at FedConnect, www.fedconnect.net. All requirements for preparation, submission, and receipt of offers contained in the solicitation shall be adhered to.
<p>The Department of Interior (DOI) U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) The Crustal Geophysics and Geochemistry Science Center, in collaboration with the Central Mineral and Environmental Resources and Eastern Energy and Mineral Resources Science Centers, Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, CO, USA conducts geologic investigations into the geologic framework and mineral resource potential in a region known as the Mid-continent Rift. The project is supported by the Mineral Resources Program, within the Energy and Mineral Resources Mission Area. The project area covers the midwestern states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Iowa. Because most of the Mid-continent rift is covered by younger formations, the investigation relies heavily on subsurface information that is supplied through the use of a variety of geophysical methods and well log data. These data sources are used to determine geologic structure, stratigraphic relationships, tectonics, and geologic history as it relates to understanding the distribution of mineralization throughout the region. To this end, the USGS currently requires seismic data brokers to furnish and deliver two dimensional (2-D) multichannel seismic reflection data from an area in northern Wisconsin, where available geophysical and geologic information fall short in understanding critical questions about a scientifically important part of the Mid-continent rift.</p>
<p>The awarded contractor shall provide existing 2-D seismic reflection data from the area. The data must have been acquired from and processed using the minimum standards and specifications described in the Specifications.</p>
<p>Evaluation - Commercial Items. The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible seller whose bid conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other non-price factors considered. Offers submitted in response to this solicitation will be evaluated based upon the following non-price or non-cost factors, of which Factor (B) will be of most importance:</p>
<p>Factor (A) Past Performance: offerors shall submit not less than two references for services performed during the past three years. Each reference shall include: the company or agency name, address, contract or order number, point(s) of contract phone number and email address(es);</p>
<p>Factor (B) Quality of Data: All offerors must provide maps (hardcopy, jpg, or tiff) depicting the locations of available seismic data from within the area.</p>
<p>The USGS select lines of interest and request to view paper copies of the final processed data and make a final decision on which digital data to purchase. The digital data shall be of such quality as to allow the USGS interpreters the ability to distinguish key geologic features. Data must be of sufficient resolution to allow interpretation of subsurface structures (e.g., faults and folds, stratigraphic features such as sequence stratigraphic units, incised valley, unconformities, and pinch-outs; and diapiric structures caused by salt or mud flow). If the quality of the processed data are not of sufficient quality to allow for the interpretation of subsurface structures (e.g., faults and folds, stratigraphic features such as sequence stratigraphic units, incised valley, unconformities, and pinch-outs; and diapiric structures caused by salt or mud flow), the USGS will request access to the raw unprocessed field data in order to re-process the data with better results.</p>
<p>The contractor offering seismic data with the highest CMP fold will be of greater technical merit.</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the vendor whose quotation, conforming to this solicitation, is determined to be the most advantages to the government, cost or price and the other non-cost or non-price factors listed.

<p>Ombudsman Notice</p>
<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-91)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />Email: OPAP@uscg.mil<br />Fax: 202-372-8447<br />Phone: 202-475-5786</p>

<p style="LINE-HEIGHT: 16.8pt; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt">(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>This acquisition will utilize the Lowest Price Technically Acceptable (LPTA) source selection procedures. Technical tradeoffs will not be made and no additional credit will be given for exceeding acceptability. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Award will be made to the acceptable offeror with the lowest evaluated price, that is deemed responsible in accordance with the FAR and whose proposal conforms to the solicitation requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Note: If a proposal receives an "Unacceptable" rating after initial evaluation and will require revisions in order to meet the technical requirement, the Government reserves the right to exclude the offeror from the competitive range.</p>
<p>The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers in the following relative order of importance: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>1. Price, 2. Technical Acceptability, and 3. Past Performance. Technical and past performances, when combined, are of significantly more important that cost or price. The technical and past performance evaluations will be performed beginning with the lowest priced offeror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the lowest priced offeror is technically acceptable, has acceptable past performance and meets all other requirements of this solicitation, the evaluation will stop and award will be made to that offeror.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>1) Price: <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>A price evaluation will be performed on all offerors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors will be ranked from lowest to highest price based on the Total Evaluated Price.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>2) Technical Acceptability: Technical acceptability will be rated on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. Acceptable ratings will be given when the offerors proposal clearly meets the minimum requirements of this combined synopsis solicitation. An unacceptable rating will be given when offerors proposal does not clearly meet the minimum requirements of the combined synopsis solicitation. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Offerors proposals will be rated on technical acceptability using the attached drawings and <span style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Arial', 'sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">capability to fabricate and assemble the F-22 Tail Section Work Stand</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Offerors should pay attention careful to address all SOW requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>3) Past Performance: Past performance information may be gathered from both Government and Commercial sources. Past Performance will be rated on an "acceptable" or "unacceptable" basis. An "acceptable" rating is given when based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has a reasonable expectation that the offeror will successfully perform the required effort, or the offeror's performance record is unknown (see note below). An "unacceptable" rating is given when based on the offeror's performance record; the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>Note: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance (see FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)). Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, "unknown" shall be considered "acceptable."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Records of adverse past performance will be addressed IAW the FAR 15.306</p>

Requests shall not require more than 2 workdays of advance notification if the Government representative is in residence in the Contractor's plant, nor more than 7 workdays in other instances.  <br>  (j) The Government shall accept or reject supplies as promptly as practicable after delivery, unless otherwise provided in the contract. Government failure to inspect and accept or reject the supplies shall not relieve the Contractor from responsibility, nor impose liability on the Government, for nonconforming supplies.  <br>  (k) Inspections and tests by the Government do not relieve the Contractor of responsibility for defects or other failures to meet contract requirements discovered before acceptance. Acceptance shall be conclusive, except for latent defects, fraud, gross mistakes amounting to fraud, or as otherwise provided in the contract.  <br>  (l) If acceptance is not conclusive for any of the reasons in paragraph (k) hereof, the Government, in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law, or under other provisions of this contract, shall have the right to require the Contractor (1) at no increase in contract price, to correct or replace the defective or nonconforming supplies at the original point of delivery or at the Contractor's plant at the Contracting Officer's election, and in accordance with a reasonable delivery schedule as may be agreed upon between the Contractor and the Contracting Officer; provided, that the Contracting Officer may require a reduction in contract price if the Contractor fails to meet such delivery schedule, or   <br>  (2) within a reasonable time after receipt by the Contractor of notice of defects or nonconformance, to repay such portion of the contract as is equitable under the circumstances if the Contracting Officer elects not to require correction or replacement. When supplies are returned to the Contractor, the Contractor shall bear the transportation cost from the original point of delivery to the Contractor's plant and return to the original point when that point is not the Contractor's plant. If the Contractor fails to perform or act as required in (1) or (2) above and does not cure such failure within a period of 10 days (or such longer period as the Contracting Officer may authorize in writing) after receipt of notice from the Contracting Officer specifying such failure, the Government shall have the right by contract or otherwise to replace or correct such supplies and charge to the Contractor the cost occasioned the Government thereby.  <br>  DFAR 252.211-7003 - Item Unique Identification and Valuation (Dec 2013), is hereby applicable.  <br>  All quotes are due no later than 2:00 p.m. (CST), 22 September 2014.

The authority to protest the placement of an order under (a) (10)(i)(B) of this section does not expire for DoD, NASA, and the Coast Guard.
AFARS 5116.5(b) (c) Each HCA shall designate a task and delivery order ombudsman for the contracting activity.

FY2016 RSC 81st Yellow Ribbon Events; Firm Fixed Price ("FFP"); Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable ("LPTA") based award (the lowest, aggegrate priced quote). The successful vendor shall be permitted to invoice after each monthly event.  The award will be made on or immediately after 1 November 2015.  There are 9 events held in ORLANDO FLA.  The general concept is picking up passengers from the airport and transporting them to the site hosting the Yellow Ribbon Event and return on Sunday.  A bulk of the participants will arrive on the respective Friday, some late registrants on Saturday in the AM, and all participants who need transport will be returned to the airport on Sunday.  The PWS/SOW is attached and incorporated herein in its entirety.  The United States Government (USG) reserves the unilateral right to change the dates for any particular event with 96 hour notice without cost to the USG.  The successful vendor will be required to interact with the USG representative managing and organizing these Yellow Ribbon Events.  For the most part, each Yellow Ribbon event is a ?cookie-cutter? and the PWS/SOW is generally the same for all 11 events.  The successful vendor is fully responsible in ensuring that all passengers/participants are picked up, transported safely to the Yellow Ribbon event, and returned on the respective Sunday for the individuals? return flight home in a timely-prompt fashion.  There will be some USG representatives ?roaming? the airport to assist the successful vendor in identifying the participants-passengers.  The USG does not waive any attrition; that is, the USG will only pay for the transportation services it actually uses.  Every vendor must attach to its quote a breakdown of its pricing methodology as a seperate attachment.  For example, the vendor charges by the trip, by the passenger, by the hour, or just a flat fee.  The USG will be able to provide the names of hotels at the time of award.  Each vendor should assume that the respective hotels will be no more than 20 miles from the airport.  This solicitation is for transportation services, and FAR 52.219-14 will need to be addressed in every vendor's quote.  Every vendor is encouraged to provide as much information as possible so that the USG can understand the quote.
The successful vendor must be able to do business with the USG and be fully registered with CCR, ORCA (now called SAM); WAWF, et cet., 1, Job; <BR><span class="label">LI 002: </span>NOVEMBER 2015 EVENT ORLANDO FLA

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals--<br />(1) [_] Are, [_] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and<br />(3) [_] Are, [_] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and<br />(4) [_] Have, [_] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.<br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:<br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments.

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract.

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope.

<p>(ix) 52.212-2, Evaluation-Commercial Items (JAN 1999) applies to this acquisition as follows:<br /><br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the<br />responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:<br /><br />Factor A -- APPROACH AND CAPABILITIES - Offerors will be evaluated based on their corporate and individual qualifications to perform the work; adequacy of equipment, materials and facilities proposed; and experience with the types of operations identified in the solicitation.</p>
<p>Factor B -- PAST PERFORMANCE -- Performance by the quoter and its subcontractor(s) as it relates to all solicitation requirements will be evaluated. The evaluation will include the quality of supplies and services previously performed, timeliness of performance, customer satisfaction and indication of ability to improve performance through proactive management. Evaluation of this factor will be based on the information contained in the proposal and information provided by references.

<p>Factor C - PRICE</p>
<p>Factors A and B are considered to be substantially more important than price in this evaluation process.<br /><br />(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).<br /><br />(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>The government reserves the right to make an award to other than the lowest priced offer or if the contracting officer determines that to do so would result in the best value to the government.</p>

The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest.<br />(d) Remedies.

If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk.<br />(g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver. <br />The following additional terms and conditions apply: <br /><br />52.217-8 OPTION TO EXTEND SERVICES (NOV 1999)</p>

<p>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: <br />(1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. <br />(2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an "I agree" click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., "click-wrap" or "browse-wrap" agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. <br />(3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. <br />(b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures.<br /><br />52.232-40 PROVIDING ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO SMALL BUSINESS SUBCONTRACTORS (DEC 2013)</p>

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC> <br>  The Maneuver, Aviation, and Soldier Division Chief, Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) is seeking sources interested in providing technologies for unmanned ground vehicles for the US Army.  In today's military, unmanned systems are highly desired by Combatant Commanders for their versatility and persistence.  By performing task such as surveillance; signal intelligence; precision target designation; improvised explosive device detection and defeat; tunnel exploration and mapping; mine detection and clearing; and chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear reconnaissance, unmanned systems have made key contributions to the Global War on Terror.  With the continued employment of increasingly sophisticated forces of unmanned systems, there will be an ever-increasing demand for new, efficient, innovative and effective technologies.  A better understanding of technologies currently available and/or under development will allow the Army to develop more comprehensive concepts and meaningful requirements.  Responses should include technologies with regards to:   <br>    <br>  1) Communications (antennas, Line of Sight, Non-Line of Sight);   <br>  2) Platforms (emphasis on, but not restricted to, small, lightweight);   <br>  3) Attachments (highly dexterous arms, charge placement, sensors, lights, cameras (color and IR));  <br>  4) Power (batteries, rechargeability);  <br>  5) Mobility;  <br>  6) Countermeasures (both for survivability and offensive use);  <br>  7) Autonomy.  <br>    <br>  Responses to this RFI are not limited to domestic US vendors. Organizations should present their responses in the attached spreadsheet.  Submitters should include as much information as they feel appropriate, however, columns A through Y as especially critical.  Specification sheets and product information may also be provided in addition to the spreadsheet.  Responses to this RFI must be unclassified.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  THIS REQUEST IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, QUOTES OR AN INDICATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL CONTRACT FOR THE ITEMS CONTAINED IN THIS NOTICE.  THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOT REIMBURSE RESPONDENTS FOR ANY COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBMISSSION OF THE INFORMATION BEING REQUESTED OR REIMBURSE EXPENSES INCURRED TO THE INTERESTED PARTIES FOR REPONSES.    <br>        <br>    The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Aberdeen Proving Ground (ACC-APG), Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005, on behalf of the US Army Product Director Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PD-PNT), is conducting a market research to seek information on the state of the art and the ability of industry to support the development and production of position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites.      <br>        <br>    Background and Description:    <br>        <br>    This Request for Information (RFI) by the Army seeks industry feedback on the latest state of the art position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites and the ability of industry to support development and production of position references (i.e., self-navigation) for Global Positioning System (GPS) Pseudolites.     <br>        <br>    GPS Pseudolites are systems that can be deployed terrestrially or near-terrestrially that transmit signals that are similar to GPS Satellite signals. Pseudolite technology has been shown to enable suitably programmed GPS receivers (e.g. software only modifications) to determine their position, velocity and time even under severe electromagnetic interference (jamming). The technology, as demonstrated, has little or no adverse impact on unmodified GPS receivers (military or civilian). The Army plans on deploying pseudolite transmitters on: land vehicles, namely trucks and combat vehicles, and aircraft such as unmanned air vehicles and lighter than air platforms.    <br>        <br>    The technologies sought should be other than Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Sensor technologies. Examples of technologies to consider are: Celestial, terrain matching, geophysical matching, and signals of opportunity. Technological approaches are not limited to these examples. Addressees are encouraged to submit any and all technologies that can be used as a source of own position for GPS Pseudolites.     <br>        <br>    Requested Information:      <br>        <br>    The Government is requesting contractors provide sufficient information in the form of a white paper which demonstrates that the contractor can develop and support this capability.  White papers can address any or all of the above described requirements.  White Papers are limited to 10 pages and should include:    <br>        <br>    1) Description of past performance regarding development and manufacture of the technologies submitted in response to this RFI.     <br>        <br>    2) Approach for providing the technology device or concept.    <br>        <br>    3) Input on the schedule and Rough Order of Magnitude cost that it would take to develop the technology to the point that it can be successfully tested in the field (Technology Readiness Level 5).    <br>        <br>    4) Identify any dependencies or external references the submitted technology requires.     <br>        <br>    5) Name, telephone number, street address and email address for Program, Technical and Cost information.    <br>        <br>    Responses:    <br>        <br>    In addition interested sources are requested to submit a brief summary of capabilities to include in-house capability versus outside resources (i.e. subcontractors/teaming arrangements), and complete the enclosed questionnaire to include information such as company size, past performance information, facility security classification currently held, and pertinent points of contact.    <br>        <br>    All responses shall be unclassified. In order to receive classified or For Official Use Only (FOUO) information, interested parties must provide the following information to the Interactive Business Opportunities Page (IBOP):    <br>        <br>    Company Name:    <br>    Company Cage Code:    <br>    Corporate Mailing Address:    <br>    Classified Mailing Address:    <br>    Security Office Information:    <br>    Name/Title:    <br>    Email:    <br>    Phone:    <br>        <br>    All submissions must be in Microsoft Word or Adobe PDF (1-inch margins and 12 point Arial or Times New Roman font), e-mailed to donald.w.leath.civ@mail.mil.

<CONTACT>Matthew Monetti, Email Matthew.Monetti@hq.dhs.gov - Sharon Flowers, Contracting Officer, Phone 202-254-6816, Email Sharon.Flowers@hq.dhs.gov
<DESC>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S&amp;T) is seeking information on emerging technologies that address challenges faced by the United States' first responder community. Information will be used to assess technologies' ability to provide a solution to previously identified high priority capability gaps, which are outlined below. The Government is considering hosting a demonstration and operational assessment of promising technologies in Fiscal Year 2015. Currently, only Government developed technologies are anticipated to be demonstrated, but the potential exists for privately developed technologies to be included as well. If it is determined that such technologies be included, a Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be issued which will contain evaluation criteria and any agreement needed to further evaluate technology. Companies, educational institutions, laboratories and other organizations are invited to submit information on their products.
<p><br />This is a Request for Information (RFI) only, as defined in FAR 15.201(c) and 5.205(c). Responses should be focused on the technology areas identified below and must be Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 or above. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this RFI. Responses will be treated as information only. Companies that respond will not be paid for the information submitted and the Government will not pay for any submission preparation/related costs.</p>
<p><br />Documents submitted in response to this RFI will not be returned. The Government is under no obligation to provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI. There is no guarantee that any submission in response to this RFI will result in a Government invitation to the demonstration and operational assessment. The Government may or may not use any responses to this RFI as a basis for a subsequent project.</p>
<p><br />Submissions should address one or more of the following capability gaps for law enforcement personnel, emergency management agencies, and public safety providers:</p>
<p><br />&bull; Situational Awareness: defined as the capability to obtain and distill specific knowledge concerning threats, hazards and conditions in a timely matter to support incident management decisions across all phases of a catastrophic incident response.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to know the location of responders and their proximity to risks and hazards in real time. Geolocation of responders (identify their location on the incident scene tied to latitude, longitude and altitude coordinates or area-specific designations such as a street address), in all environments (in other words, indoors, outdoors and maritime), combined with simultaneous awareness of incident hazards.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to detect, monitor and analyze passive and active threats and hazards at incident scenes in real time. Remote monitoring of threats and hazards, combined effects assessment, and automated Red-Force tracking.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to rapidly identify hazardous agents and contaminants. This includes improved standoff detection and identification of multiple hazards, multi-sensor integration and analysis, and risk assessment and decision support to command.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to incorporate information from multiple and nontraditional sources,(for example, crowdsourcing and social media) into incident command operations.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Communications: defined as the capability to seamlessly and dynamically connect multiple persons or entities and convey meaningful and actionable information to all relevant parties.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to communicate with responders in any environmental conditions (including through barriers, inside buildings and underground). Improve communication systems to operate effectively in all environments, e.g. utilizing multi-sensory communications systems integrated with PPE; voice and data communications through all physical and electronic environments, and disaster resistant communications systems.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Communications systems that are hands free, ergonomically optimized, and can be integrated into PPE. Integrating communication means with PPE to reduce the number of devices responders have to carry as well as improving range and clarity.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Command Control and Coordination: defined as the ability to identify incident priorities, allocate scarce resources and exchange relevant information to make effective decisions in a stressful environment.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to remotely monitor the tactical actions and progress of all responders involved in the incident in real time. Allocating responders in real time and integrating their actions into a workflow system remotely.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to identify trends, patterns and important content from large volumes of information from multiple sources (including nontraditional sources) to support incident decision-making system. This system should be capable of integrating large amounts of data, identifying emerging trends and patterns and filtering for key information.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to identify, assess and validate emergency-response-related software applications.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Responder Health, Safety and Performance: defined as the ability to identify hazards to public safety personnel and develop appropriate mitigations to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with response activities.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Protective clothing and equipment for all responders that protect against multiple hazards, e.g. developing a modular mission-specific protective layers and wearable materials and systems that can easily decontaminated.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Logistics and resource management: defined as the ability to identify, acquire, track and distribute mission-specific equipment, supplies and personnel in support of catastrophic incident response.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to identify what resources are available to support a response (including resources not traditionally involved in response), what their capabilities are and where they are, in real time). A logistic management system that allows resource data to be exchanged and provides a clear resource-related common operating picture to help allocate available responders.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to monitor in real time the status of resources and their functionality in current conditions, such as providing data concerning the functionality of specific resources that could improve the incident command's ability to make resource allocation decisions.</p>
<p><br />&bull; Casualty Management: defined as the ability to provide rapid and effective search and rescue, medical response, prophylaxis and decontamination for large numbers of incident casualties and identify appropriate sheltering, transportation and destination options.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o The ability to remotely scan incident scene for signs of life and decomposition to identify and locate casualties and fatalities. Need technologies capable of detecting signs of life or death, incident-specific casualty modeling and prediction, and integrating data and decisions made to model and predict incidents. Improve the indoor, outdoor and subsurface casualty geolocation capability.</p>
<p><br />All information received will be treated as public knowledge. Therefore, do not submit proprietary information in response to this RFI. Specific information sought includes:</p>
<p><br />1. Company information, including name, address, point of contact, URL, and the number of employees.<br />2. A point of contact for follow-up information, and the point of contact's phone number and e-mail address.<br />3. Product name, capability gap(s) addressed, brief description, operational context(s), and specifications.<br />4. Cost information, such as purchase price and General Services Administration (GSA) schedule information, if available.</p>
<p><br />No feedback will be given on any of the product submission. The point of contact may be contacted following submission for more detailed product information.</p>
<p><br />Submittals<br />Only electronically submitted submissions will be accepted. The Government will answer all written questions, and requests for clarification regarding this posting. No telephone calls will be accepted. Submissions, questions, and written requests for clarification shall be submitted to the following point of contact: Matthew Monetti (<a href="mailto:Matthew.Monetti@hq.dhs.gov">Matthew.Monetti@hq.dhs.gov</a>).</p>
<p><br />E-mail your non-technical questions to Sharon Flowers, DHS Contracting Officer (Sharon.Flowers@hq.dhs.gov).</p>

Information to be provided by the Government will be limited to status updates pertaining to specific procurements. The Government will not provide any procurement sensitive information that would violate the integrity of the source selection process.   <br>    <br>  Although minutes/notes for each session will not be provided, a document library has been created on STRIBOP for posting of miscellaneous briefings/presentations that may be provided during the PALT update sessions. These presentations can be accessed via the following link:   <br>    <br>  https://bop.peostri.army.mil/sites/bop/PALT%20Update%20Session%20Briefings/Forms/AllItems.aspx   <br>    <br>  New briefings will be posted to the document library within 3 business days after the applicable session.   <br>    <br>    <br>  IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PARKING: Due to limited parking in the Partnership II/III parking lot, all visitors MUST park in the large parking lot on the corner of Science Drive and Technology Parkway.

<DESC>Notice of the Government's Intent to Award a Sole-Source Contract.<br /><br />The Coast Guard Command, Control, Communications, and Information Technology Service Center (C4IT SC) Procurement and Contracting Organization, in support of the Coast Guard Operations Systems Center (OSC), intends to award a sole source, fixed-priced contract with CompSec, Inc. The period of performance will be 01 January 2015 - 31 December 2015. The contract will provide enterprise licenses to support the Coast Guard's enterprise IT services, such as incident management, reporting, change management, and configuration management in Kearneysville, West Virginia.
<p>The purpose of the contract, if executed, will be to ensure the continuity of mission critical enterprise IT services for the U.S. Coast Guard.</p>
<p>The C4IT SC Procurement and Contracting Organization intends to negotiate this contract on a sole source basis with CompSec, Inc. in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR A COMPETITIVE QUOTE. Competing this requirement and awarding to any other entity would result in substantial delays and disruption of several key projects already in progress and would also increase the overall cost to the government.</p>
<p>Any response to this notice must be submitted in writing to the Government and show clear and convincing evidence that another source is capable of meeting the Government's requirements and that competition of the requirement would be advantageous to the Government. If no written responses are received at least fifteen (15) days after the publication of this response, the extension will be awarded without further notice.</p>
<p>Questions and comments pertaining to this procurement shall be emailed to Craig.E.Anderson@uscg.mil.</p>

<DESC>S05 - Vendor Questions & Concerns for:
619-15-1-5137-0005 / VA247-14-R-1461 / FLOOR CARE & MAINTENANCE SERVICES
1.	The SOW states that all work will be performed Sunday thru Thursday after 3:30.  
Is this for the period's floor care services of stripping and waxing, top scrub recoating, and burnishing only?  
Correct

2.	The pricing sheet within the SOW states that the sweeping and mopping will be provided 365 days per year. Is this number correct based on questions #1? Will sweeping and mopping the facilities be 7 days a week?
Services are to be provided only Sunday thru Thursday. Total work days 261 (NO Fridays or Saturdays)
3.	Can you please provide the square footage for the facilities requiring services covered under this solicitation? When are proposals due? Can you provide the name of the current/past contractor and the amount of the current/past contact?
1.2 million SQ ft. / Final Proposals are due by NOON CST on November 21, 2014 / No information about past and/or current contractors or amounts will be released.
4.	The hours of operation are unclear, the solicitation states:
 
 Operating hours/supervision: the contractor operational hours shall be after normal administrative hours between 3:30 p.m. and 12:00 p.m. Sunday thru Thursday. Contractor shall not be required to work on federal holidays and weekends. When a holiday falls on a Sunday, the following Monday will be observed as a legal holiday when a holiday falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday is observed by U.S. government agencies. Contractor may work beyond the specified time but not later than 4:00 a.m. each day. If a decision is made to work beyond 12:00 p.m., the COR shall be notified. Supervisory personnel shall be on the job site while work is being performed.

Please clarify, should the hours be daily from 3:30pm to 12:00am (Midnight) Sunday thru Thursday otherwise this would be 20.5 hours daily.

Contractor operating hours are Sunday through Thursday from 11:00pm until 6:30 am.  Staff or Supervisor will report in to 2nd Shift Supervisor at the start of the shift, and meet w/1st Shift Supervisor and have an AAR at the conclusion of the shift.

      5.	 Is overtime allowed on this contract?

That depends on the Contractor.  If we request additional work from you, it's your call whether you pay your staff O/T to perform those tasks, but THIS IS A FIRM-FIXED PRICE CONTRACT AND THE VA WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR FUNDING OVERTIME.

      6.     For the site visit, is this a walk-in basis or are we required to schedule specific times?
             
   The preference is to address ALL INTERESTED VENDORS AT ON TIME starting at 10:00 am CST,   
   However with prior coordination the requesting service MAY be able to honor individual requests.

<DESC>JUSTIFICATION FOR SINGLE SOURCE AWARDS IAW FAR 13.106-1
(OVER MICRO-PURCHASE THRESHOLD($3K) BUT NOT EXCEEDING THE SAT ($150K))
IAW FAR13.104, COs must promote competition to the maximum extent practicable to obtain supplies and services from the source whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government, considering the administrative cost of the purchase. When competition is not practicable, IAW FAR13.106-1(b), COs solicit from a single source for purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold.  COs may solicit from one source if the CO determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, brand-name or industrial mobilization). IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3),COs are required to include additional statements explaining the absence of competition (see 13.106-1 for brand name purchases) if only one source is solicited and the acquisition does not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold (does not apply to an acquisition of utility services available from only one source) or supporting the award decision if other than price-related factors were considered in selecting the supplier.  This template when completed can be used to document single source awards IAW FAR13.106-3(b)(3).  Note: Statements such as "only known source" or "only source which can meet the required delivery date" are inadequate to support a sole source purchase.  
1. PURCHASE REQUEST OR REQUISITION NUMBER:
618-15-1-3308-0002	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$36,000.00
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

The Contractor must provide Basic (LEC) services at each location of service to include Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS), Frame Relay, ISDN PRI, DSL, DS1/T-1, Ethernet, Token Ring, DS3/OC-1, Fast Ethernet, and DS3/T-3D for both the inter and intra data locations in addition to all specifications of the statement of work (SOW) 

3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  . 
These services are currently under transition to a National Contract which will administer all current contracts.  Information has been collected from all VA's nationally for all services provided by current contractors and submitted through a LEC Data Call.  Any changes to services provided or service providers, could delay the National Contract solicitation process.  
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
Suggested Source: AT&T. Switching to another provider at this time would take weeks to months to transition fully and would require resubmitting new data to be incorporated into the new National Contract requirements.  Also, a change in providers at this time exposes the facility and all other sites to the risk of inadvertent outages that may impact patient safety. 
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
Market Research was not conducted due to the possible delays in awarding a National Contract that could occur if service data already submitted was altered or changed.  Also, due to the complexity of the work in the transition from one provider to another, service disruptions have a greater chance of happening which would have patient safety implications
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

618-15-1-6023-0013	1A. PROJECT/TASK NUMBER
	1B. ESTIMATED AMOUNT: 
$89,092.10 (base + 2 options) 
2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE INTENDED USE:

Fixed price, base plus two option year sole source Contract for preventive maintenance, repairs and service of four (4) Getinge manufactured cart washers.  Proprietary repair FAR Part 6.302-1.
3. UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT LIMIT AVAILABILITY TO ONLY ONE SOURCE, WITH THE REASON NO OTHER SUPPLIES OR SERVICES CAN BE USED:  . 
Getinge shall provide parts and labor to maintain the Getinge manufactured, 9100 model cart washers located in The Sterilizing Processing Services Department, Food and Nutrition and the Building 49 Research department. The services are crucial to the sterilizing and cleaning of equipment that supports the VA Surgery Department, as well as other infection control-critical areas.
4.  REASON THAT SUGGESTED SOURCE IS THE ONLY SOURCE, WHICH CAN PROVIDE THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES:  
This equipment is Proprietary to the manufacturer.  Getinge, the manufacturer, is the only vendor qualified or able to provide service on this equipment.  
5. DESCRIPTION OF MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND RESULTS OR STATEMENT WHY IT WAS NOT CONDUCTED:
There are no other responsible sources available at this time.  If other responsible sources are found in the future, competitive offers will be solicited. Steris Corporation and Minnesota Medical Corporation were both contacted for possible maintenance sources, but neither of them has been factory trained by Getinge, and therefore is not qualified to work on this equipment.
6. Contracting Officer's Certification: Purchase is approved in accordance with FAR13.106-1(b). I certify that the foregoing justification is accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.
