<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Administration for Children and Families, Office of Community Services (OCS) administers at the Federal level the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  The purpose of LIHEAP is to assist low-income households, particularly those with the lowest income that pay a high proportion of household income for home energy, in meeting their immediate home energy needs.  The OCS developed the LIHEAP recipiency targeting index to measure a specific group of households participation in LIHEAP.  The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) focuses on program results to provide Congress with objective information on the achievement of statutory objectives or program goals.  As a result of GPRA, programs must be able to demonstrate that they are delivering results for their cost and this emphasis has led to a focus on the process of Managing for Results.  In Managing for Results linkages need to be established between program resources, activities, outputs and outcomes.  A logic model is a technique that can be used for identifying results along the continuum.  The model is used to identify logical relationships between the results of a program activity and an outcome, defined as a result stated in terms of the programs clients.  Currently, the OCS has developed a LIHEAP logic model for heating assistance.  In addition to heating assistance, LIHEAP also provides for the following types of LIHEAP assistance?cooling, crisis, equipment repair and replacement, weatherization, and Assurance 16 activities.  The components of LIHEAP assistance support the goals of home energy affordability and sustainability, which impact home energy-related health and safety risks in various ways.  The LIHEAP performance measurement plan needs to be expanded to assess the performance of all program elements.  OCS developed, under contract, the Home Energy Insecurity Scale in 2003.  The Scales intent is to furnish a summary measure that describes the home energy status of LIHEAP eligible households.  OCS is interested in learning what projects have made use of the Scale and to what extent such projects have determined the Scale is a reliable and valid tool that describes and tracks the home energy status of LIHEAP eligible households.

The OCS needs a single contractor that possesses specialized knowledge and experience in the following areas:  (1)  The methodologies, practical implications, and trends related to the LIHEAP recipiency targeting indexes for young children and the elderly; (2) Strategic planning and development of logic models related to home energy assistance; (3) Historical knowledge of outreach methods employed by OCS related to improving recipiency of households with elderly and young children members, inter- and intra-agency collaboration on targeting elderly and young children, and development of LIHEAP targeting indexes; and (4) Use of the OCS Home Energy Insecurity Scale.  The work to be performed will (a) Extend LIHEAP logic models; (b)  Analyze recipiency targeting index rates at the national, regional, and state-level for young child households receiving heating assistance; (c) Analyze recipiency targeting index at the national, regional, and state-level for elderly households receiving heating assistance; and (d) Compile projects that have used the OCS Home Energy Insecurity Scale.

The OCS knows of only one contractor that has the necessary skill sets to provide these services and intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with APPRISE, Inc., 32 Nassau Street, Suite 200, Princeton, NJ 08542.  APPRISE has been justified as a sole source because APPRISE staff have unique knowledge and experience in conducting LIHEAP performance measurement studies, developing LIHEAP logic models on heating assistance and targeting elderly households, using the OCS Home Energy Insecurity Scale and the establishment of the LIHEAP recipiency targeting indexes for elderly households and households with a young child.  A labor hour contract with a fixed price ceiling shall be awarded under the terms of FAR Subpart 13 Simplified Acquisition procedures.  The contract shall be for a one year period and shall not exceed the simplified acquisition threshold ($100,000).  Interested parties that can demonstrate the specialized knowledge and experience in the areas (1) through (4) set forth above and who have staff available to start immediately at time of award may submit a capability statement.  Reference Number 07Y013617 and e-mail responses no later than the closing date stated in this notice to msunday@psc.gov .  No solicitation document is available.  Responses of capability are due 15 days after publication of this notice; authority to negotiate on a sole source basis is FAR 13.106-1(b).  Review of the information is for the purpose of determining whether to conduct this requirement competitively.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement following review of responses submitted to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

An affirmative response would include literature, brochures and such other materials, which correspond to the required items stated herein.
