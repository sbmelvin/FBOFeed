<DESC>This is a notice of intent of the National Institute of Aging at the National Institutes of Health to procure research on a firm fixed price contract to Carlyn Consuting of Leesburg, Virginia.  

   A.  BACKGROUND
The Behavioral and Social Research Program (BSR) at the National Institute on Aging intends to enter into a contract to conduct an evaluation of the Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program.  RCMAR is an ongoing program of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and has been funded continuously for eight years.  Two years remain on the current five year funding cycle; NIA needs to evaluate its overall effectiveness to determine what changes are warranted for the third funding cycle.  While the RCMAR program conducts its own internal semi-annual progress reviews (the “Emphases and Outcomes Report”) through its National Coordinating Center, it is desirable to have an external evaluation of the program to determine the RCMAR’s ability to achieve its short- and long-term goals.  
BSR was successful in being awarded an Evaluation Set-Aside grant for the purpose of evaluating the RCMARs.  The independence of the evaluator of the RCMAR program is scientifically imperative.  At the same time, it is necessary that the evaluator have a secure and in-depth understanding of the nature of NIH Center programs.
The RCMAR program is NIA’s premier research infrastructure building activity for research on diverse populations.  It is comprised of six Centers throughout the U.S. and a National Coordinating Center.  Minority populations included in the funded RCMARs are rural and urban African Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans.  The RCMARs are cofunded by NIH’s National Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities and the National Institute for Nursing Research.  Funded by the P30 mechanism, the combined budget is just over $4,000,000 per year.  
Each RCMAR is comprised of an Administrative Core and three closely interacting additional Cores.  The Investigator Development Core is responsible for mentoring younger “RCMAR Scholars” (all post-PhD or MD) who are either minority researchers or have an expressed interest in conducting research on older diverse populations.  The Community Liaison Core establishes and maintains working relationships with diverse communities through outreach activities and conducts research on recruiting and retaining older diverse populations for research.  The Measurement and Methods Core develops methods and techniques for research on diverse populations.  The mentoring activity of the Investigator Development Core is central and uses the other two Cores to assure excellence of the mentoring function.  A Coordinating Center handles trans-RCMAR activities and works closely with NIA staff.  
The RCMAR mission statement includes the following four goals relevant to this evaluation.  

1.	Decrease health disparities by increasing the number of researchers focusing on the health of minority elders. 
2.	Enhance diversity in the professional workforce by mentoring minority academic researchers for careers in minority elder health. 
3.	Improve recruitment and retention methods to enlist minority elders in studies so that research can accurately identify and work toward solutions to health disparities. 
4.	Create culturally sensitive health measures to assess the health status of minority elders with greater precision, reliability and validity. 
To accomplish the complex evaluation task of the RCMAR program, it is necessary to work closely with an independent contractor (1) with no ongoing ties to NIA, (2) who fully understands the NIH system, (3) has outstanding Evaluation Science skills, and (4) is committed to conducting this task quickly and thoroughly.  
The evaluator will work closely with a panel of experts in the area of diverse populations and research administration.  Members of this panel, which is also to be funded by the Evaluation Set-Aside award, will have separate contracts which will be prepared subsequently.
B.  PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PROCUREMENT
The purpose of this procurement is to work with BSR and a panel of experts in evaluating the Resource Centers for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) program.  It is imperative that a highly experienced Evaluation Scientist who is independent of NIA conduct this research.  The Evaluation will help to determine the future direction of the RCMAR program as it goes into its third cycle of funding.  BSR was successful in being awarded an Evaluation Set-Aside grant for the purpose of this independent evaluation.  
C.  CONTRACTOR REQUIREMENTS
The contractor must possess the following characteristics.  
•	be intimately knowledgeable about the functioning of NIH, preferably as a former NIH employee;
•	have a secure and in-depth understanding of the nature of NIH Center programs;
•	be an expert in Evaluation Science;
•	be willing and able to undertake the direction of a panel of six experts; 
•	be able to quickly and accurately analyze data from multiple sources;
•	have no ongoing ties to NIA;
•	have a strong and lengthy history of doing evaluation research;
•	have worked on evaluation projects previously within the NIH context;
•	have worked with senior NIA staff in the past who can provide recommendations;
•	be able to develop appropriate performance measures for the RCMAR program;
•	have a strong history of evaluating minority/diversity programs;
•	demonstrate experience in tracking career paths;
•	have sufficient database management and statistical skills to analyze collected data;
•	demonstrate evaluation experience with a wide variety of diseases; 
•	demonstrate evaluative experience in dealing with research in community settings; and
•	possess an advanced degree in a field related to the evaluation effort.

GOVERNMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
NIA/BSR will supply the Contractor with all information requested that is germane to the project and will be available to answer additional questions about the project.  It is in the very nature of an evaluation project that BSR/NIA not impose its own strong direction on the evaluation research but instead remain neutral and serve as a resource for the evaluator when needed.  In addition, the RCMAR National Coordinating Center (funded by NIA as part of the RCMAR program) will cooperate with the Evaluation Scientist in providing the necessary data to undertake this activity.
The purchase order will benefit NIA by providing necessary and timely scientific evaluation services by an experienced and outstanding expert in the field.  The resulting evaluation will serve to direct the next interaction of the RCMAR program (RCMAR III) at a time when funding needs to be carefully directed and mentored to achieve the maximum scientific benefit.  
E.  TASK PLAN
To evaluate the effectiveness of the RCMAR program in meeting the four Program Goals listed above, the Evaluator will undertake the following activities.
For Goal 1, on increasing the number of researchers who focus on the health of minority elders, evaluation questions will include:  
•	Do the studies conducted by RCMAR Scholars relate to the RCMAR Mission by contributing to the field of aging research?
•	Do publications and grants by RCMAR Scholars, once they have become independent, remain focused on aging research and reducing health disparities in aging populations?  
•	To what extent have the RCMAR Scholars achieved the following goals: publishing in peer-reviewed scientific journals, applying for research grants, competing successfully for research grants?  
•	To what extent have RCMAR “products” been disseminated adequately and to the appropriate public and scientific groups, as determined by baselining target audiences and their needs?
For Goal 2, on enhancing the diversity in the professional workforce by mentoring minority academic researchers for careers in health research on minority elders, the evaluation team will ask:  
•	Is there a need for increasing mentoring flexibility -- e.g., mid-career mentoring or a longer period of mentoring?
•	Can RCMAR Scholars with strong potential be identified from their baseline characteristics as determined by analysis of data about “success” in the program?  If so, should future RCMAR RFAs include recommended criteria for selecting Scholars?
For Goal 3, on improving recruitment and retention (R & R) methods used to enlist minority elders in studies, the evaluation questions will include:  
•	Have findings in this area generated by the program been published?  If so, is the publication record reasonable as compared to efforts in similar programs?
•	Are R & R methods and science coming out of the program being recognized by others doing research on diverse elderly populations -- e.g., are there citations of RCMAR R & R research?  Are there other means of further disseminating RCMAR R & R research results?  
For Goal 4, on creating culturally sensitive health measures [and methods] (M & M) that assess the health status of minority elders with greater precision, the evaluation team will ask:
•	Have findings in this area coming out of the program been published?  If so, is the publication record reasonable as compared to efforts in similar programs?
•	Are M & M methods and science coming out of the program being recognized by others doing research on diverse elderly populations -- e.g., are there citations of RCMAR M & M research?  Are there other means of further disseminating RCMAR M & M research results?  
We will also attempt to address several additional questions of importance to future planning for the program.
•	Have there been spin-offs of the RCMAR program?  For example, to what extent has the program been emulated by other Institutes and Centers at NIH?
•	Are there additional (or fewer) areas of emphases, processes, or organization that need to be incorporated as goals for the next RCMAR iteration? 
•	How can NIA enhance the interaction among its various center programs (e.g., RCMARs and the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers)?  
•	Comparing the funded RCMAR institutions with a comparable group of institutions (e.g., RCMAR grant applicants that were not funded), were the RCMAR institutions more (or less) successful than the non-RCMAR institutions in competing for NIH grants involving minority aging research?  Are there other ways to determine whether similar accomplishments could have occurred without the RCMAR program?  
•	Should the RCMARs be encouraged to become broad multidisciplinary centers funded by several NIH ICs, and/or should they be encouraged to emphasize broad NIA goals, and/or should they be encouraged to emphasize more targeted Behavioral and Social Research Program goals? 
To accomplish this activity, the activity will have the following research design.  Given the relatively small sample size (n = 8 centers over two cycles), an explanatory case study approach will be used to answer the study questions, with most of the information gathered from secondary data sources.  A consultant/evaluator will be selected and will work with the RCMAR Coordinating Center to assess the data that they collect semi-annually in the “Emphasis and Outcomes” report prepared for NIA.  Primary data will also be collected from PIs, Core Leaders, and/or other RCMAR participants (9 maximum).  Information and data sources will include progress reports and CVs of scholars, confidential interviews with selected RCMAR scholars and mentors, RCMAR publications, and the RCMAR Web site.  In addition, the Evaluator will assess data from secondary sources such as other NIH diversity programs.  OMB clearance will not be required.  
In addition to the Evaluator, an interdisciplinary panel of six professionals will be selected to provide expertise in health-related issues experienced by older diverse populations and the research needed to address them.  They will review goal-related data collated by the Evaluator and help to reach conclusions and recommendations about the RCMAR program.  The Panel will hold two conference calls and prepare a report with a set of recommendations based on their review of the empirical evaluation and the Panel’s interpretation of those data.  On points where consensus is not reached among Panel members, the nature of all opinions will be reported.  
NIA staff will work with the Evaluator to further clarify the tasks and provide access to required data.  A report, estimated to be 10-20 pages will constitute the final deliverable.  The Timeline, below, specifies steps to be taken to implement the study design.
F.  Project Timeline

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR SECURITY GUARD SERVICES A National Strategic Sourcing Initiative for the procurement of Security Guard Services (Nationwide, Alaska, Hawaii and Territories) This is a market survey for security guard services.  The responses to this market survey will be used for informational purposes only.  This is not a screening information request (SIR) or request for proposal (FP) of any kind.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals. The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.  Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors expense. The FAA intends to consolidate the current number of security guard service contracts into a smaller number of multiple contracts.  At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small business and/or 8a firms.   The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from all sources, including small business and 8a certified vendors, capable of providing armed/unarmed security guard services at various FAA facilities. This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the competition among small businesses and/or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program. The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this effort is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, with a size standard of $11.5 million.    Interested firms are required to submit the attached Business Declaration form and a copy of their SBA 8(a) certification letter, if applicable. In order to make this determination the FAA requires the following from interested vendors: 1. Capability Statement (Limited to one page) - This document should identify: â€¢	Type of security guard services provided by your firm,  â€¢	Size and type of facilities covered by previous contracts,  â€¢	Number of years in business 2.  Facilities or geographical areas where your company can provide Services -- The FAA is looking at three alternatives for contracting for these services.  The current list of facilities potentially requiring guard services is attached to this survey.  These alternatives are: â€¢	Alternative 1:  Three Service Areas  o	Eastern -Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Virginia,         Maryland, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,          Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Kentucky,         South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Puerto Rico o	Central - Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico,         Texas, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota,          Wisconsin, Michigan, Nebraska, Iowa, Arkansas, Louisiana o	Western - Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana,          California, Nevada, Arizona, Guam, Hawaii, Utah, Colorado Alternative 2:  Nine Regions o	New England - Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts,          Connecticut, Rhode Island o	Eastern - New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Virginia,          Maryland o	Southern - North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,         Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Puerto Rico o	Great Lakes - Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin,         North Dakota, South Dakota o	Central - Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri o	Southwest - Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas o	Alaska  o	Northwest Mountain - Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming,          Utah, Colorado o	Western - California, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii, Guam  â€¢	Alternative 3:  Mixed Approach o	En Route Radar Approach Control Facilities (ARTCC) - One contract o	All other facilities - Three contracts by service area Vendors may propose other alternatives.  3.  Expected programmatic approach (in-house, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) - Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small and 8a businesses.  (Limited to 3 pages.)  Attached is a draft of the statement of work.  Respondents are encouraged to review the statement of work and provide comments.

<DESC>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is one Operational Administration within the US Department of Transportation.  NHTSA is responsible for reducing the number of injuries and deaths occurring on the nation's highways.  As one approach to fulfilling this responsibility, NHTSA analyzes vehicle crashes in an attempt to determine what environmental, human, or mechanical factors may have contributed.  

The purpose of this procurement is to provide NHTSA with the capability to investigate, document and evaluate a variety of vehicle crashes on a short-notice basis.  These crash investigations typically involve school buses, child restraint systems, new or emerging technologies in automatic restraint equipped vehicles, alternative fuel vehicles, safety defects, adaptive control equipped vehicles, fires, crashes involving air bag deployment related fatalities and serious injuries and other special interest crashes as they arise.  Under this contract, the contractor shall be responsible for the timely gathering and documenting of data pertaining to these crashes.  The contractor shall also be responsible for the quality control of data submitted to NHTSA¡¦s Electronic Data System (EDS).

Specific objectives are as follows:

The contractor shall document pre-crash, at-crash and post crash circumstances and determine and describe the combination of vehicular, occupant, and environmental conditions associated with the identified crashes;

The contractor shall identify and report on all injuries resulting from the crash and associate each injury to the corresponding vehicle component or other object struck during the collision sequence;

The contractor shall determine and report on school bus crash configurations which produce injuries, the impact speeds involved, the positions of the children in the buses (seated, standing, etc.), and the crashworthiness of the buses involved;

The contractor shall examine and report on vehicles equipped with new or emerging technology in safety equipment to provide the NHTSA with information on the effectiveness of this rapidly changing technology, and; 

As needed, the contractor shall provide input on the effectiveness of the case vehicle¡¦s performance to existing Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Highway Safety Program Standards (HSPS) and /or any safety related defect.

NHTSA anticipates awarding three (3) contracts for these services in order to support three (3) major geographic regions within the United States (Western, Central, and Eastern.) Current plans state that no one contractor will receive award of more than one contract and that contracts will last at least three (3) years with options to increase the term by an additional two (2) years in one (1) year increments.

SUBJECT:  Sole Source Justification, Purchase Request # F2XHC76095A100   

            								                 
Description of the supplies and services being acquired.  The purposes of this acquisition is for CCAF to continue to license and use the Singularity transcript processing system and obtain technical support for the system.  
 
Justification for Sole Source:  CCAF, under delivery order contract # F01600-02-P-0346 and F01600-02-P-0438 has been using Hershey Business Systems Inc. (HBSI) as the prime contractor to develop the web-enabled enterprise-wide transcript processing and access management system known as Singularity.  HBSI is the sole provider of this software and is the only known source that can fill the unique licensing and maintenance requirements of this system in a cost effective, timely manner.  There are no other distributors of this service.  The software is developed by HBSI and they have proprietary rights to the software.  CCAF will continue to closely monitor ongoing advancements and design innovations in the commercial computer software industry and will actively seek to solicit input from additional contractors in the future to assure full and open competition is available on all future acquisitions of this type.  This software must be licensed annually and maintained through software updates, patches, and additional capabilities.  This effort requires the contractor to have considerable knowledge of CCAF’s Student Information System (STARS), remote Education Services Offices access processes, and the integration and delivery of EDI 130 Transaction Files from the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO) EDI server located on the University of Texas at Austin campus.  Over the past year, HBSI acquired a thorough understanding of CCAF’s business processes, developed system specifications for the Web-Enabled Enterprise Wide Transcript Access Management System, designed and implemented the integration layer that is used to enhance the tracking of scanned and electronic received transcript information into the CCAF’s student information system, the Student Transcript, Administration and Record System, (STARS).  HBSI has also worked with CCAF technical personnel to deliver out-bound sorting of transcript data from STARS, to deliver electronic transcripts, conforming to the 130 transaction set to the AACRAO EDI server.  In addition to the out-bound electronic transcript process, HBSI developed the Automated Transcript Process Module to track out-bound EDI transactions and in-bound EDI transactions.  HBSI has developed this expertise over the last eight years by working with major higher education institutions similar to CCAF, such as University of Alabama, Auburn University, California State University, etc.  Throughout this period, HBSI has developed a Web -based framework that is J2EE compliant / XML based with a variety of products and systems that enhance student success, credit transfer and records retention.

Justification that source is the only known source: It has been determined from the first solicitation with HBSI being awarded the initial contract to deliver and perform to the Statement of Work (SOW), that no other contractor who specializes in similar projects could accomplish the roll out deployment and/or support the application.  In addition, the current developed software codes and comprehensive understanding of the CCAF internal business processes along with the expertise of the external EDI transaction data for incoming transcripts to CCAF support the fact that no other contractor could adequately support the current application and future enhancements.

Actions taken to preclude future sole source applications:  No action can be taken to preclude future sole source acquisitions under the current conditions (proprietary ownership of Singularity Imaging System and software).

<DESC>Continuing a centuries-old legacy of extraordinary public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design Excellence Program seeks to commission our nation’s most talented architects to design Federal buildings of outstanding quality and value, buildings that provide superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees, that are models of energy efficiency and environmentally responsible, and that give contemporary form and meaning to our democratic values.  In this context, the General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in Public Architecture and is seeking an Architect-Engineering (A-E) design team for the construction for a new FBI Agency Campus to be located on 11000 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, CA. 
SCOPE OF WORK
The new construction includes mid-rise buildings for office and storage space; a special maintenance facility and parking structures located within in the southwest corner within the existing 28-acre Government site in west Los Angeles bounded by I-405 and Wilshire Boulevard.  These buildings will be located within the existing campus of a 1970’s international-style18-story Federal Building.
These new buildings will be built in two project phases, Project Phase I and Project Phase II.  Project Phase I, will include the design of approximately 228,000 gsf of office space, 190,000 gsf of library-style storage, a 47,000 Automotive Radio Maintenance Facility (AMRF), secured parking for 1000 cars, in addition to the existing 600-vehicle parking structure, and a secure barrier around the campus to meet current security standards.  Project Phase II, will include an additional 472,000 of office space and secured parking for 900 cars.
These new facilities shall conform to the latest building codes, including but not limited to the most current seismic standards, security requirements including blast mitigation and progressive collapse mitigation, utility systems, fire safety, and the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standard (ABAAS).  They will also respond to the need to reduce energy consumption.

The estimated total construction cost for Project Phase I is between $140,000,000 and $160,000,000.  The overall design and construction project will have a contract completion period of approximately five years.  Project Phase II is planned to follow immediately after Project Phase I.

The Firm Fixed Price base A/E Services contract will include Pre-Design, Preliminary Concepts, and Final Concept phases for both Project Phase I and II.  At the end of the Base Contract, the Government will determine the procurement method, (i.e. traditional design/bid/build, bridging design/build, etc.) based upon economic times and funding conditions.


The Government reserves the right to exercise additional work as options.  The scope of the A-E Services under this Firm-Fixed Price Contract may include as options for Project Phase I only but is not limited to the following: Pre-design services including special studies, surveys, site investigation, schematics design, design development, preparation of working drawings and contract documents to be completed in CAD, specifications, estimating services, value engineering, post-construction award services and other supplemental services as appropriate to the project needs.  
SELECTION PROCESS
The Selection is comprised of two stages as follows:
Stage 1: There is no geographic limitation associated with Stage 1 and Design Excellence.  This stage will establish the Design Excellence capability of the lead designer and the associated A-E design firm.  The lead designer is the individual or team of designers who will have primary responsibility for the project design. The A/E Firm referred to in this RFQ means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design.  The lead designer will also be involved in commissioning an artist or artists for this project and in assisting with the successful integration of works of arts into the architectural design.  Additionally, the lead designer must be an employee of the Design A/E Firm.  In this first stage, a minimum of three lead designers and their associated A-E firms will be “shortlisted” based upon the submittals in response to this Request for Qualification (RFQ).
Identification of team members, other than the Lead Designer(s),is not required at this stage. Consultant and “production firm” (if different from the Design Firm) information should not be included in the Stage I portfolio.

Sufficient time (30-days) will be provided to the A-E design firms to establish project teams.  Information shall be provided outlining how to describe the team’s capabilities and accomplishments with an emphasis on the projects that the team has collaborated on previously:  There is a geographic limitation that 51% of the contract must be performed in the State of California.   During Stage 2, A/E must demonstrate that they meet the geographic limitation .

Consideration for selection will be based on the following criteria:
1)	Proposed Project Team:  Key personnel background and qualifications including previous relevant experience.
2)	Project Management:  Proposed project planning, scheduling, team coordination, cost control methods, quality control methods and production facilities.
3)	Design Experience:  Visual and narrative evidence of the proposed team’s design capability with respect to new construction.
The Government will establish the date these Stage 2 submittals are due and provide selection criteria for the interviews and final selection process in conjunction with the Stage 1 shortlist announcement.
In Stage 2, A joint venture and/or a firm/consultant arrangement will be considered and evaluated on a demonstrated interdependency of members to provide a quality effort.  The government will not allow payment for travel, living expense, computer time or hookups for the prime or the consultants.  The firm must also demonstrate the capability to perform all contract services.

<DESC>CONTACT Point of Contact  Adam Butryn, 732-427-1008. Repair and Maintenance of AN/AVS-7(V) Family HUD Assemblies and Subassemblies. This is a market survey to locate potential sources of repair and maintenance for the AN/AVS-7(V) family HUD assembli es and subassemblies. The HUD enables helicopter pilots to use the Aviators Night Vision Imaging System (ANVIS) goggles during flight operations. The HUD provides critical operational information to the pilot superimposed over the ANVIS image. The HUD min imizes the requirement for the pilot and co-pilot to look at the flight instruments, thus allowing them to concentrate on scanning outside of the cockpit. The government is seeking interested sources for the Repair and Maintenance of the AN/AVS-7(V) family  of HUD systems. The government intends to purchase these services using an indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery (IDIQ) contract over a two-year period. Respondents must have extensive knowledge of the ANVIS HUD system.   Potential offerors will be resp onsible for turning the nonfunctional components received from the government into ones which meet the most current operation form, fit and function as called out by applicable technical data within a repair cycle time of thirty (30) days. This effort also  requires the maintenance of a parts inventory sufficient to support the aforementioned repair cycle time. Depot Maintenance Work Requirements (DMWRs) do not exist for this equipment. A complete technical data package was never procured and therefore is un available. The Government will not provide any test equipment or facilities for this effort.   Any interested sources must send the following information, NLT 15 May 06, to C-E LCMC IEW/S Directorate, ATTN: AMSEL-LC-IEW-N-II (Adam Butryn), Bldg. 1201, Ft.

The Aeronautics Test Program, residing under NASA’s Shared Capability Assets Program (SCAP), will protect and preserve key aeronautics test facilities.  The structure of the ROA NRA will require that proposals be submitted to the most relevant aeronautics program elements, which will be described in Appendices to the NRA.  Specific Proposal submission deadline dates, any particular evaluation criteria, and submission points of contact by NASA Center will also be identified in the NRA Appendices.   Proposals must be submitted electronically, and all proposers may use NASA’s proposal data system, NSPIRES ( http://nspires.nasaprs.com ), or Grants.gov.  Electronic submission of proposals is required, and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization.  Participation is open to all categories of organizations, including educational institutions, industry and nonprofit organizations. Note that electronic submission of all proposals is a new requirement this year. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. Each electronic proposal system places requirements on the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information.  This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 and NFS 1835.016.

<DESC>NASA/KSC has a requirement for two Matrox Axio Video Capture and Editing Systems, which will be used to upgrade KSC’s Press Site Webcast Studio (PSWS).  The upgrade consists of the procurement of products manufactured by Matrox and Rorke and the procurement of installation, integration, testing, validation, and extended systems support for the two upgraded systems and NASA/KSC’s three existing Matrox systems.  The two systems include: (a) Matrox Axio HD Workstations (qty 2); (b) 3 years Matrox Axio HD Advantage (support/coverage) for the two new systems; (c) 3 years Matrox Axio HD Advantage (support/coverage) for the three existing systems; (d) annual frontline (local) support for the two new systems; (e) annual frontline (local) support for the three existing systems. NASA/KSC intends to purchase the items from Profile East, Inc (PEI), an authorized Matrox service support dealer.  There is no single “off-the-shelf” product capable of meeting NASA/KSC’s requirement; these systems utilize software and hardware components from different manufacturers, integrated to perform specialized tasks using expert skills.  It is vital that PSWS personnel retain the use of the same software package across all video capture and editing systems.  PSWS personnel have extensive experience and in-depth knowledge of Adobe Premiere Pro.  This requirement requires the integration of components that are certified by Matrox to work with the Axio HD card set.  The Matrox hardware is critical to the production of video content produced for launch, landing, and other special events distributed through the NASA Portal and NASA Direct. The upgrade will enable the systems to be backward compatible with the roughly 4,000 videos previously produced with Adobe Premiere software and Matrox hardware.  It is imperative that the Government have local support, knowledgeable of the integrated equipment and compatibility/integration/upgrade issues, and who can service this system and the three previously procured systems within a timely manner to avoid unacceptable delays on the most visible of NASA’s public information websites.  PEI is the only known, local authorized dealer that provides service support for both Matrox and Rorke, two vital components of this equipment.  PEI has prior experience providing integration and testing support to KSC; the company provided KSC’s three existing Matrox systems.   Moreover, PEI is able to provide KSC with the timely local support when needed. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on Friday, May 5, 2006.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.	A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is seeking technical support for the Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), Office of Atmospheric Programs (OAP) in the Clean Air Markets Division (CAMD).  It is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to provide a quality assurance program to evaluate and document the performance of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP).  Primary support of this contract shall be to provide in-field systems and performance survey services (herein after referred to as surveys) to assess and aid the performance and maintenance of the nationwide, long-term wet deposition monitoring networks of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP). NADP collection stations are currently comprised in three sub-networks which include: precipitation chemistry and wet deposition sites in the National Trends Network (NTN); precipitation chemistry and wet deposition sites in the Atmospheric Integrated Research Monitoring Network (AIRMoN); and measurements of mercury concentrations in precipitation at wet deposition sites in the Mercury Deposition Network (MDN).   There are currently over 250 wet deposition sites in the NADP/NTN, over 90 sites in the NADP/MDN, including over 40 that are collocated at NTN sites, and 8 sites in NADP/AIRMoN, including three that are collocated at NTN sites. NADP operates sites throughout the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. EPA provides support to the National Acid Deposition Program (NADP), a cooperative, multi-agency network, which measures precipitation chemistry and estimates atmospheric deposition for various pollutant ions and mercury.  The surveys are undertaken to provide quality assurance pertaining to siting, sample collection and handling, equipment operation and maintenance, record keeping, reports and field laboratory procedures.  Site performance survey reports for the networks must be compatible with, and capable of, being electronically transferred to the data base maintained by NADP.   The surveys are essential to providing the quality assurance for NADP?s data analysis and require a high level of skill in audits of air quality monitoring systems and quality assurance, quality control, and data management. The contractor will be responsible for selecting sites for survey and initial communications, making pre-trip travel and other preparations, conducting site surveys, providing technical assistance to site operators, and conducting maintenance.  It is anticipated that the resultant contract will be firm-fixed price with a one-year base period and four one-year option periods.  The RFP will be issued on or around May 16, 2006 with proposals due 30 days after issuance of the solicitation.  This requirement is a total small business set aside.  The applicable NAICS code is 541620 with a size standard of $6.5 million. As it becomes available, information regarding this procurement will be posted at http://www.epa.gov/oam/hpod.  In an effort to streamline communications to the maximum extent possible, the subject RFP, amendments and other related items for this procurement will be posted at this same web site.  Offerors must download the RFP and related documents from the Internet as no printed copies will be available.  Questions regarding the procurement may be e-mailed to the Contracting Officer at roberson.denise@epa.gov.  Telephonic requests for information will not be honored.

<DESC>The US Department of State Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Office of Aviation (INL/A) intends to procure up to fifty commercial PT6-3B twin pack engines from Pratt and Whitney on a sole sources basis.

The commercial Pratt and Whitney PT6-3B Twin Pac engines are to be procured to replace the military T400 power sections currently installed in the UH-1N helicopters operating in Colombia.  The UH-1N helicopters in Colombia provide downed aircrew Search and Rescue /gunship support for the Colombian eradication mission.  INL/A is the major operator of the T400.  The current 40+ year old engines require replacement due to:
•	Military T400 engines are no longer being manufactured and are considered obsolete 
•	Minimal parts and spares availability for repairs 
•	Substantially increased costs for scarcely available parts / spares
•	Lack of updated technical publications and procedures
•	Increased man-hours to maintain
•	Reduced technical engineering support / Safety of Flight coverage 
•	Degraded performance not adequate for mission flight profile 
•	Safety risk to flight crew and passengers
•	Decreased mission availability 

Pratt and Whitney is the only manufacture of commercial engines that are Bell Helicopter (Original Equipment Manufacture) approved for installation on the UH-1N / Bell 212.  Installation of the commercial Pratt and Whitney PT6-3B Twin Pac will satisfy all the requirements listed above and is the only option available to keep our UH-1N flyable.  Additionally, it will significantly reduce the current high risk to the USG and INL/A.

<DESC>The Department of Education plans to issue a sole source contract to the National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine (IOM) to identify gaps in disability science and to propose steps to strengthen the evidence base for public and private actions to reduce the impact of disability and related conditions upon individuals and society in the United States.  Building on the 1991 IOM report, Disability in America and the 1997 report Enabling America, the IOM will review progress and developments since the publication of those reports. Further the IOM will approach disability broadly by considering disability across the lifespan (i.e. variety of ages) and by examining a variety of disability conditions.  The assessment of principles and scientific evidence for disability policies and services will take international perspectives and models into account.  The NAS/IOC has unique capabilities with experience in the technical issues of analysis of data and depth of experience in providing services of this nature and quality to the government.   The period of performance is anticipated from time of award through September 30, 2007.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The United States Army Communications - Electronics Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) intends to award, on a sole source basis to Raytheon Company, 2501 W. University Drive, McKinney, Texas, a five (5) year, multi-year, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract for Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) Second Generation Forward Looking Infrared (SGF) Block 1 A-Kits/B-Kits, Power Conditioning Units, Spare Parts, and Technical Services.  The HTI SGF program entails the development and production of a com mon Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) subassembly (known as the B-Kit) which  is integrated, through the use of platform unique components (known as A-Kits), into multiple vehicular platforms such as the M1A2 System Enhancement Package Abrams tank, M1A1 Abra ms Integrated Management (AIM) tank, M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, Long Range Advance Scout Surveillance System (LRAS3), Stryker Brigade Combat Team Reconnaissance Vehicle (RV) and Fire Support Vehicle and the M707 Knight.  The HTI SGF  A-Kit/B-Kit provid es enhanced reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition capabilities used in operational environments in which stealth is essential to the safety of Warfighters.  The PCU provides stable power to the M1A1 AIM tanks A-Kit, which provides a far targ et acquisition capability.  The SGF Block 1 A-Kit/B-Kit and PCU are particularly effective when other systems fail due to reduced visibility from poor atmospheric conditions (e.g., rain or fog) or in the presence of obscurants (e.g., smoke or oil).  Additi onally, spare parts and technical services will be obtained under the proposed contract to ensure operational units are available to meet Warfighter requirements.  The basic contract, will include two one-year options.  This acquisition is for 4,607 Horizo ntal Technology Integration (HTI) Second Generation Forward Looking Infrared (SGF) Block 1 A-Kits/B-Kits, 517 Power Conditioning Units (PCUs), spare parts and technical services.  Raytheon is the only existing contractor capable of producing and delivering  Block 1 A-Kits/B-Kits and PCUs to the Army beginning January 2008.  The Government does not own the detailed data rights/drawings for the Block 1 A-Kits, B-Kit or PCU that would enable the Government to compete this effort.  A tracking number of W15P7T-06 -R-M202 has been assigned to this effort. This is posted for informational purposes only. TECHNICAL questions may be addressed to Mr. Patrick Hite, email:Patrick.hite@belvoir.army.mil 703-704-1840. CONTRACTUAL questions may be addressed to: Ms. Kathleen H.

<DESC>AIR FORCE INSTITUTE FOR OPERATIONAL HEALTH (AFIOH) 
BROOKS CITY-BASE TEXAS
Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses

SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS)
FA8900-06-R-9002
24 April 2006

Headquarters Air Force Material Command, Aeronautical Systems Center, 311 Human Systems Wing, Air Force Institute for Occupational Health at Brooks City Base, San Antonio TX is conducting market research for information in developing a preliminary acquisition strategy for Air Force Chemical Sample Analyses requirements.  This synopsis is for market research only.  It is not a: Solicitation or a commitment by AFIOH to contract for services identified herein.  The Government will not pay respondents for information in response to this market research.  This SSS and the information collected will not restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach.   

1.  PURPOSE/GENERAL INFORMATION:  AFIOH is considering awarding a firm-fixed Price (FFP) Blanket Purchase Agreement(s) (BPA) or an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract(s) for chemistry and occupational health services in support of operational requirements at various Air Force installations (See attachment 3).  The Government is interested in identifying firms who possess the capability and experience to provide laboratory support services for Chemical analysis of environmental and occupational samples. The current projected rough order of magnitude (ROM) for all bases is $8 to $9 Million over a five year period of performance.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAIC) code for this effort is “541380”.  Interested sources should provide a capabilities package per the instructions below.  

2. BACKGROUND/DESCRIPTION: The objective of this market research is to identify sources who are capable of, or capable of teaming with other firms to provide a full spectrum of laboratory support services to include: sample transportation, receiving, storage, analysis, chain-of-custody, analytical reporting, and disposal of the following types of samples: organic, inorganic, conventional, and general chemical.  Samples may also include mixed wastes (waste that is composed of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) hazardous constituents).   Samples originate from but are not limited to: groundwater, surface water, waste streams, soil, sediment, solids, fuel, oil, and coal ash/sludge. Any future contract vehicle will require the contractor to meet all applicable federal, state, local laws and regulations.  Specific details regarding sampling requirements are contained in the attached Draft Performance Work Statement (See attachment 1).  The sample analyses and historical estimates of analytical requests per region are contained in attachment 2. 

3.  PRELIMINARY ACQUISITION STRATEGIES.   Industry comments are encouraged and welcomed. The Government would like to award any future requirement to a single company or teaming arrangement of companies.  However we are not aware of any one company or teaming arrangement that is positioned to meet all of our future requirements.  Therefore, we are currently contemplating three acquisition strategies.  The first possible strategy is to provide all GSA schedule 66 III holders a fair opportunity for Blanket Purchase Agreement(s).  A second contemplated strategy is a competitive commercial BPA, or lastly a Full and Open Competition resulting in multiple award IDIQ contract(s).  In either case the Government is contemplating a best value source selection based on the following criteria:

1. Mission Capability 

a. Technical Capability - Laboratories shall be accredited for each applicable test sample method by a nationally recognized laboratory accreditation body, e.g.; the National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference (NELAC), compliant with ISO/IEC 17011:2004.  All laboratories must demonstrate the capability to generate acceptable results from the analysis of proficiency-testing (PT) samples, using each applicable method in a specified matrix.  Those laboratories who describe their procedures in maintaining operational capabilities necessary to perform environmental compliance analyses and who also at a minimum provide certification.  Certification requirements at a minimum consist of the labs being either NELAC or EPA certified with all applicable State and Local regulatory agencies.  Potential agencies will receive favorable evaluation credits for meeting the minimum requirements plus any additional certifications provided.  Laboratories that also provide examples of sample test code and function data documentation and examples of their proficiency in the development of functional electronic data documents will be given more favorable evaluation credit.  
b.	Management Approach - Laboratories must conduct and document an internal 
Quality Control (QC) program for all laboratory work performed pursuant to the guidelines established by the EPA, the DoD QSM and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).  Interested parties and their teammates or subcontractors, should meet or exceed minimum Quality System Performance standards for Department of Defense (DoD) Acquisitions Involving Environmental Sampling or Testing Services, as any resulting solicitation and contract vehicle will include this requirement.  The DoD Quality Systems Manual (QSM) for Environmental Laboratories provides implementation guidance on the establishment and management of quality systems for environmental testing laboratories that intend to perform work for DoD.  This guide is based on the NELAC Quality System requirements, which is consistent with ISO/IEC 17025: 1999, provides implementation clarification and expectations for DoD environmental programs.   Laboratories must provide an established laboratory quality system that complies with ISO/IEC 17025:19999.  The laboratory must also maintain certification conformance to the DoD QSM.  Laboratories that provide documentation that their QC systems and procedures have been assessed as operational and in conformance with the above listed programs will receive favorable evaluation credit.   
 	2.  Proposal Risk.  Proposal risk evaluation focuses on the weaknesses associated with an offeror's proposed approach. Assessment of proposal risk considers potential for disruption of schedule, increased cost, poor performance, the need for increased government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract performance

3.  Past Performance -  The primary purpose of this performance review is to ensure that accurate data on contractor performance is current and available for use in source selections through the Past Performance Informational Retrieval System (PPIRS). Performance assessments will be used as a resource in awarding best value contracts and orders to contractors that consistently provide quality, on-time products and services that conform to contractual requirements. This information can be used to effectively communicate contractor strengths and weaknesses to source selection officials. 
  
4.  Price - The Government will use Best Value in the evaluation of price.

4.  NARRATIVE SUMMARIES BY REGION OF INSTALLATIONS. 
Testing requirements for each base will vary.  The last 2.5 years of historical requirement quantities for each base is listed in attachment 2.  There is a high degree of geographical diversity associated with this work.  The installations reside within the continental United States, therefore, the contractor will need to be familiar with the differing state regulations and be certified by the state where the installation is located.    

5.  ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE:

	Milestone				 __		Dates of Completion
	1.  RFI Issued							25 April 06
	2.  Questions from Contractor	s				25 April – 12 May 06

<DESC>The Mid-Pacific Region of the Bureau of Reclamation is conducting a market survey in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 10.001 to obtain feedback from industry regarding the general requirements for an upcoming procurement.  THIS SYNOPSIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  It is a market research tool to determine potential sources and interested parties in the intended procurement to conduct cultural resources studies in support of the Humboldt Project Conveyance.  If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized and posted at http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis. This procurement is being considered for 100 percent set-aside for HUBZone small business concerns; however, ALL interested parties are requested to respond, regardless of business size or category.  If adequate interest or sufficient supporting documentation is not received from HUBZone concerns, the solicitation may be issued as a small business set-aside or unrestricted basis without further notice or may be canceled.  The proposed North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this acquisition is 541620, Environmental Consulting Services and the related small business size standard is $6M.  Responsible sources having relevant experience should submit a capabilities package not longer than six pages demonstrating the ability to perform the services described in the PROJECT DESCRIPTION below via email to cursino@mp.usbr.gov or by mail to Claire K. Ursino, Contracting Officer, Bureau of Reclamation, 2800 Cottage Wy, Rm E-1815, Sacramento CA 95825-1898. Packages should include the following information:  (1) Business name, address, CAGE code, size classification based on NAICS size standard, socioeconomic classification (e.g., HUBZone), and a point of contact; (2) a copy of the certificate issued by the SBA of your qualifications as a certified HUBZone small business concern (if applicable); (3) a positive statement of your intention to submit an offer for this requirement as a prime contractor; (4) corporate and individual cultural resource experience in the Nevada and the Great Basin; (5) a summary of capabilities to conduct technical aspects of the contract that includes predictive archeological modeling and geographic information system (GIS) familiarity; and (6) evidence of experience performing work similar in type and scope to include: contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts and points of contacts with telephone numbers and past experience relevant to the work described below within the past five years.   Finally, Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and Annual Representations and Certifications, as required by FAR 4.1102 and 4.1201, apply to this procurement.  Prospective contractors must be registered prior to award.  Lack of registration in the CCR database will make an offeror ineligible for award.  Information on CCR registration can be obtained via the Internet at http://www.ccr.gov.  Information on Annual Representations and Certifications can be obtained via the Internet at http://orca.bpn.gov.  Also, please include attachments cataloging the company's equipment assets, personnel resources and financial resources that demonstrate company responsibility and capability to perform the required work.  Responsible sources having relevant experience and the capabilities to perform the work will be considered.   PROJECT DESCRIPTION The Humboldt Project Conveyance Act (Title VIII of Public Law 107-282) directs the Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation) to transfer title of approximately 83,000 acres of Federal lands in Nevada to the Pershing County Water Conservation District (PCWCD), the State of Nevada (State), Lander County, and Pershing County.  Reclamation plans to issue a cultural resource inventory and evaluation contract to assist in our compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and implementing regulations at 36 CFR Part 800, Reclamation's Cultural Resources Management Policy and Directives and Standards, and guidance from the Nevada State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO).  A total of 23,600 acres in the Battle Mountain Pasture (Lander County, Nevada), 15,580 acres at Rye Patch Reservoir (Pershing County, Nevada), and 990 acres at the Humboldt Sink (Pershing County) are being transferred out of federal ownership to PCWCD, Lander, and Pershing Counties.   Reclamation has negotiated a plan for the inventory and identification of historic properties with the SHPO which requires the following tasks, Task One:  Prepare a historic context and research design for all three geographic areas of the transfer (Battle Mountain Pasture, Rye Patch Reservoir, and Humboldt Sink). Task Two:  Conduct a complete survey (i.e., at no more than 30-meter transect intervals) of 990 acres in the Humboldt Sink.  This task includes updating site records for three previously recorded archeological sites and recording all newly discovered cultural resources on Intermountain Antiquities Computer System (IMACS) site forms, and developing recommendations for the eligibility of all cultural resources within the transfer area for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.  Limited subsurface testing is permitted to assist in significance evaluations.  Locational information for all cultural resources must be collected using global positioning system (GPS) technology. Task Three: Conduct a complete survey of approximately 4,300 acres in Rye Patch Reservoir.  The remainder of the land being transferred was previously surveyed or lies beneath the water level and is inaccessible.  This task also includes recording all newly discovered cultural resources on IMACS site forms, preparing site records for 90 previously noted/recorded archeological sites in the transfer area, and developing eligibility recommendations for all cultural resources within the transfer area for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places.  Limited subsurface testing is permitted to assist in significance evaluations.  Locational information for all cultural resources must be collected using global positioning system (GPS) technology. Task Four:  Conduct a sample survey of 3,520 randomly selected survey units in the Battle Mountain Pasture and develop a predictive model that defines the sensitivity of unsurveyed lands to contain historic properties.  This task also calls for developing a strategy to survey 6,000 additional acres to test the predictive model and to develop a refined model.  The use of GIS technology is required for this work.  Model development will be enhanced by geomorphic studies that will be proposed and enacted by the contractor to assist in assessing the sensitivity of the area for buried cultural deposits and testing for such deposits in sensitive areas.  This task includes recording all newly discovered cultural resources on IMACS site forms and updating site records for eight previously recorded archeological sites.  Special inventory methods have been developed to inventory portions of the California Trail and other historic resources identified through research.  Determinations of eligibility are also required for all identified cultural resources and limited subsurface testing is included in this contract.  Locational information for all cultural resources must be collected using global positioning system (GPS) technology. Also included in the above tasks is the development of ethnographic sections for each of the areas focusing on Native American issues and findings.  Interviews will be conducted with participating Tribes focused on obtaining information related to sites of religious or cultural significance or traditional cultural properties on transfer lands.  Any such resources will be documented and eligibility recommendations will be prepared.   Deliverables include the historic context and research design, two, possibly three cultural resources inventory reports (including ethnographic studies), at least two predictive models, sites records, photographs, field notes, GIS shape files, and artifact catalogues.  All recovered artifacts will be curated at the Nevada State Museum.

In lieu of the CFT or PTT a higher order device may be used.  The flight simulator must be FAA certified to Level “C” or higher under current FAA Advisory Circular 120-40 criteria for the Boeing 737-700/800 configured cockpit with freeze and repositioning capability.  The following individual pilot/crew chief training courses are required:  C-40A Pilot Initial Training and C-40A Pilot and Crew Chief Recurrent Training.

<DESC>CBP REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FLEET MAINTENANCE PARTS ACQUISITION INITIATIVE

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
 
The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking industry interest and information on a requirement for the acquisition, storage, security, and on-site management of automotive parts and the stock room to support the CBP Fleet Management Branch (FMB) Office of Border Patrol (OBP). The Government seeks information from industry to assess the feasibility of having a vendor or vendors assume the responsibility for the daily operation and management of automotive repair parts and the parts room operations at OBP fleet garage facilities. Please note that this RFI has been previously issued, however, there have been modifications to the original RFI and CBP wants to obtain current market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. 

The Government seeks alternative approaches to establish and maintain this source or sources of repair parts supply management. In keeping with this goal, the Government seeks industry input to:

·	Discover additional sources for our expanding program
·	Discover and implement best practices for procuring these services and supplies

Part Acquisition:  Planning for parts acquisition on the part of the vendor rests on the premise that vendor owns all parts within the stockroom or parts still under the control of the vendor until the issuance of a work-order and associated parts request to service a vehicle or other item that is being serviced. With the receipt of the work order and issuance of the requested part(s), the vendor completes an invoice and submits it to the Government (frequency to be determined). In the event that a part is returned to the stockroom, the vendor issues a corresponding credit to the garage (frequency to be determined). Provide information concerning the honoring all warranties issued by the manufacturer or according to the part supplier. 

Warehouse (stockroom) Management Information System (WMIS):  Provide the plan to establish and maintain an inventory management system. Government Information Technology requirements mandate that the vendor-provided WMIS must be compatible with the CBP system of record and CBP, standalone system provided by Federal Prison Industries Unicor branch know as VMIS, Vehicle Management Information System. This exchange of all transactions must ensure compliance with “Standard Accounting Practices” and the “Federal Management Record” (FMR).

Stocking Requirements: For planning purposes, the vendor must maintain an inventory accuracy [measured by random cycle counts] of no less than 99% to ensure that parts are available as the WMIS states. Additionally, the level of inventory shall not be less than 6 turns per year to help ensure “fresh” inventory of all parts. The parts inventory must provide for all vehicle types stationed (domiciled) at the location or as part of a satellite facility of the primary facility. The vendor will also be required to maintain a safety stock program along with a minimum and maximum inventory plan that may be subject to the local garage management approval.

Stockroom Standards:  Vendors must establish the stockroom within the confines of the facility as allocated by OBP/CBP. The vendor may utilize the current storage equipment (if available) however the vendor will not own any storage equipment that exists. The vendor also has the option to provide storage equipment that meets their needs. 
In the event that the vendor requires any additional walls, doors, fencing and any other fixed asset it will be the responsibility of the vendor to acquire fixtures and any permits required for modification and provide funding as necessary.
It is also the vendors responsibility to ensure compliance with all OSHA, EPA and any local/state/federal building codes including electrical, fire suppression, structure integrity and any other codes that are required. To facilitate planning, the stockroom will initially occupy the current footprint with in the garage, however as part of the request for information a vendor can perform further analysis to identify the need for a reduction or an increase in square footage.

Technology: The vendor must plan to provide all infrastructures to operate the parts warehouse/stockroom. The infrastructure may/will include any cable, wireless technological that support, the sharing and exchanging inventory and transactions within the facility. It will be the option of the vendor to decide to connect the local garage with the vendors main computer system for parts reordering or maintain inventory levels. 

Hazardous Materials: Provide the management plans to address the storage of any hazardous material stored within the stockroom or still owned and controlled by the vendor. The plan must comply with all federal/local regulations. Additionally any relevant training and recorded data associated with the hazardous material must be current in the Material Safety Data Sheets book as mandated by law. It is the role of the vendor to ensure that the MSDS is current and that the training is compliant and that the vendor retains training records. However, the facility management has the option to randomly audit any training records to ensure that they are current.

Staffing:  Please provide a sample-staffing matrix of organization for this project. Please keep in mind that the stockroom must be staffed during all hours of operation and any scheduled overtime or additional shifts that are added on a permanent basis or a short-term basis. The staff at the garage may be asked to work extended hours with little notice based on the workload of the garage.

Recommendation
Buy Back Program: Include a provision in the response for procedures to inventory and assess the viability of all parts on hand that the Government has purchased in the past. Vendors will purchase these parts when they assume responsibility for them. The “buy back” program will be valued at the fair market value as defined as Cents on the Dollar. This can be offered as a one-time rebate or as an outstanding credit account to use in lieu of present cost. 

Assumption(s)
Ø	It is assumed the vendor may choose to visit a facility (with an escort) to obtain an idea of the parts structure and the financial investment of the program.
Ø	It is the responsibility of the vendor to provide any necessary office supplies, technology (hardware and software) above and beyond the system of records hardware and the standalone applications.
Ø	It is also the responsibility of the vendor to provide basic uniforms for their employees to present an appropriate manner for their position.  


There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.

This Request For Information is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Government will issue a procurement action. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as the result of the submission of contractor’s information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified.

<DESC>CBP REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FLEET VEHICLE PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE INITIATIVE

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
 
The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking industry interest and information on a requirement for fleet vehicle preventive maintenance support. CBP seeks to acquire information in order to identify the feasibility of a vendor or vendors assuming full responsibility for managing, operating and supporting a total preventive maintenance program. Service provider will perform these functions either on site or at the vendor’s location. This request for information pertains to all of CBP fleet garages and assigned vehicles. Currently there are twenty-two (22) primary locations through out the country with an additional 160 secondary locations. Options for this program can be at a national level or regional level defined as the Southeast, Southwest, Northwest and the Northeast (which includes the Mid-Atlantic portion of the country) or at a local level. HOWEVER, pricing must be for the entire sector and not at station level. Please note that this RFI has been previously issued, however, there have been modifications to the original RFI and CBP would like to obtain current market information, or capabilities for planning purposes. 

The Government seeks approaches to establish and maintain such a maintenance program. In keeping with this goal, the Government seeks industry input to:

·	Discover sources to perform these services for our fleet management program.
·	Discover and implement best practices for provision of these services.

As part of the ongoing effort to increase the financial efficiency of “Customs and Border Protection”, by reducing the burden place on the Border Patrol garages of performing Preventive Maintenance:
·	Schedule A
·	Schedule B
·	Schedule C

It is at the discretion of the vendor to provide service on-site or at the vendor(s) location. It must be stated that the vendor will not be able to use the CBP OBP garages. Each vendor is responsible for providing all materials needed for the maintenance and if the work is performed on-site, the vendor(s) is responsible for the removal of all materials. In the event that the vehicles will be serviced off-site these vehicles must be serviced at non-operational time for that vehicle so the mission of the OBP is not compromised due to vehicles not being available due to PM Program.

Third Party Provider: In the event that the primary vendor is planning to use a third party for this service please provide a plan as to how this structure will be managed and coordinated for optimal service to CBP FMB customers. It is still the responsibility of the primary vendor to handle any problems generated by the third party provider and the primary vendor will still be held accountable for all of the vendors or third party vendor’s actions.

Tools:  It may be necessary for the vendor to invest in some specialized tool for unique vehicles such as the “Humvee” or vehicles with “Skid Plates”. This investment will be the sole responsibility of the vendor and is not subject to reimbursement from the Federal Government.

Pricing: Please provide concept for information and planning purposes only (Do not include specific prices for vehicles at this point, this will be part of the RFP). It is understood that due to the unique feature of selected vehicles that pricing is subject to any specialized equipment that is not standard for that vehicle. The vendors(s) can provide pricing as: 
·	Hourly rate plus parts.
·	A Flat rate plus parts.
·	A Package> Labor and Parts combined.
·	ABC (activity based cost) method.
·	Pricing based on volume of vehicles.
·	Pricing based on types of vehicles.

Scheduling: Provide information on development and management coordination of all scheduling needs of the vehicles included in this program. Include procedures for the resolution and scheduling remedies for special adjustments to the schedule that may occur due to emergencies. As previously stated “In the event that the vehicles will be serviced off-site these vehicles must be serviced at non-operational time for that vehicle so the mission of the OBP is not compromised due to vehicles not being available due to PM Program.”


Data Warehousing/Management: Provide information for a system of advance notification of the scheduled due date. This notification can be in the form of e-mail, or a hard copy document. Also include a plan and/or system to warehouse any data /records for all vehicles serviced by the vendor. This data must comply with documentation requirements required by all and any federal, state and local agencies. Government Information Technology requirements mandate that the vendor-provided data must be compatible with the CBP system of record and CBP, the standalone system provided by Federal Prison Industries, Unicor branch, know as VMIS, Vehicle Management Information System. This exchange of all transactions must ensure compliance with “Standard Accounting Practices” and the “Federal Management Record” (FMR).

Material: Provide the information required to ensure that all materials provided meet or exceed the manufactures recommendations. Also provide a plan for Hazardous Waste or Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) temporary storage and/or disposal using the proper procedures indicated by all Federal, State or local agencies or best practices. This plan must include the maintenance of current Material Safety Data Sheets for materials classified as HAZMAT as required by law.

Assumption(s)
Ø	A listing of vehicle types and approximately the number of vehicles can be provided in a generic manner due to the sensitivity of the operations.
Ø	It is the responsibility of the vendor to provide any necessary office supplies, technology (hardware and software) above and beyond the system of record hardware and the standalone applications.
Ø	It is also the responsibility of the vendor to provide basic uniforms for their employees to represent CBP in an appropriate manner for their position.

<DESC>CBP REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FLEET RFID TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION INITIATIVE

THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) AND NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP).
 
The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking industry interest and information on a requirement for the acquisition of a RFID system to monitor the consumption of fuel and to capture the mileage of the vehicle fleet which will support the CBP Fleet Management Branch (FMB) Office of Border Patrol (OBP). The Government seeks information from industry to assess the feasibility of having a vendor or vendors install and maintain this RFID technology. In keeping with this goal, the Government seeks industry input to:

·	Discover additional sources for our expanding program
·	Discover and implement best practices for procuring these services and supplies

Abstract:  It is the intent of this project to identify a vendor(s) that can provide the technology /hardware and the software (must interface with our standalone system for vehicle maintenance) to accurately record the vehicles mileage and refueling usage. The sites identified will be those OBP garages that currently use a bulk fuel tank to dispense fuel(s) to OBP vehicles.

Assumption(s)
Ø	It is assumed the vendor may choose to visit a facility (with an escort) to obtain an idea of the parts structure and the financial investment of the program.

Technology: CBP FMB is searching for the most efficient manner to transfer the vehicle information, fuel consumption and recorded mileage as accurately as possible. It is the intent of this RFI to find a system that makes gathering of this information as transparent to the vehicle operator as possible. It is preferred to use wireless technology to gather the information from the vehicle. However a manual system will also be accepted as long as the error rate of entering data can be kept to a minimum. 

The information gathered, regardless if it is manual or through a wireless/hardwire technology, must then be transferred to a local host computer by a wireless or hard-line/wire method or a combination of the two techniques. 





There is no bid package or solicitation document associated with this announcement.

This Request For Information is for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that the Government will issue a procurement action. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as the result of the submission of contractor’s information. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for proprietary information not properly identified. The Government will safeguard proprietary information in accordance with applicable Government regulations. Sources responding to this RFI should provide four copies of their information and estimated cost data to the Contract Specialist at Customs and Border Protection, Attn: Hyun Jung Koo, 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite 901 NP, Washington, DC 20229. Alternatively, submissions via e-mail to the Contract Specialist at hyun.koo@dhs.gov are acceptable. The estimated cost data are for budgetary/planning purposes only. Firms should also include their business size, CAGE code, Dun & Bradstreet number and GSA Schedule should they possess one. For those small businesses interested in responding to this RFI and who have questions concerning how to conduct business with the Government, please contact Mr. William Bickelman, (202) 344-1168. 

All submissions will adhere to the following deadlines:

	Hard copies: 4:00 p.m. E.D.T., June 1, 2006
	Electronic mail: 4:00 p.m. E.D.T., June 1, 2006

<DESC>U.S. Army Program Executive Office Soldier, Project Manager Soldier Equipment (PM SEQ), 10170 Beach Road, Bldg 325, Fort Belvoir VA 22060 is submitting a Request For Information (RFI). The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research and identif y potential sources for a Next Generation Body Armor System to replace the U.S. Armys current Interceptor Body Armor (IBA).   The IBA currently consists of an Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) with yoke and collar, throat protector, and groin protector; two removable Enhanced Small Arms Protective Inserts (ESAPI); and two Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI) and carriers. The OTV is cu rrently configured as a front opening carrier vest that incorporates a left front, right front, and back soft ballistic insert (SBI). The SBI provides fragmentation and 9mm ballistic protection. The OTV carrier vest is configured with MOLLE webbing to supp ort the attachment of fighting load components such as ammunition pouches, grenade pouches, hydration systems, and other individual items of equipment. The Army seeks to identify a Next Generation Body Armor System to enhance individual Soldier mobility, reduce weight, improve comfort, facilitate fighting load carriage, and improve weight distribution of ballistic and fighting load components.  The contem plated system must not impede Soldier tasks including the operation of individual weapons (rifle, grenade launcher, and pistol), the operation of crew served weapons, and the ability to throw fragmentation and smoke grenades. The contemplated system must a lso allow for safe operation, ingress, and emergency egress of combat vehicles such as M1A1 Tanks, Bradley Fighting Vehicles, and Armored Security Vehicles; as well as tactical vehicles such as the Up Armored HMMWV.  The Next Generation Body Armor System s hall provide a provision for emergency cut away of the complete body armor system. The Army envisions that the Next Generation Body Armor System will be configured as a side opening vest to provide a front armor panel that facilitates flexibility in arrang ing the fighting load without restricting the ability to donn and doff the system. The opening configuration must support fast access to an injured Soldiers front and rear torso area by medical personnel or first responders providing battlefield first aid . The system should be capable of being reassembled in less than 30 seconds. The contemplated system must provide proper fit to 5th percentile female to 95th percentile male Soldiers. A sizing provision that accommodates various torso lengths is desired. All design approaches submitted for the Next Generation Body Armor System will be considered.  Design approaches with prototypes or production representation are desired.  The Army will also consider design approaches that will incorporate existing ESAPI a nd ESBI ballistic inserts. An integrated side pocket design approach is needed to eliminate the requirement for a separate carrier for the ESBI. The Army seeks to retain the capability to accommodate either the 7Wx8H ESBI side plate or the size extra sma ll ESAPI plate in the side pocket of the Next Generation Body Armor System. Adjustment of the plate within the pocket, up or down, is also desired to accommodate individual body types. The Next Generation Body Armor System must also provide a tailorable ca pability to incorporate modular extremity protection system/components for the shoulder, such as the Deltoid Axillary Protection System (DAPS), and arm and leg protection.  Request interested vendors having a proposed configuration for Next Generation Body Armor System submit information and samples to PM Soldier Equipment, Technical Management Division, ATTN: Karl Masters, 10170 Beach Road, Bldg 325, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-5 820. Information may be sent by e-mail to Karl Masters at email address karl-masters@us.army.mil. All submitted information will be protected as proprietary. Responses are requested not later  than 31 May 2006.  The submission of this information is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the government to procure any items or services, nor for the government to pay for the information received. No solicitation document exists.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information
<DESC>INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INTERESTED PARTIES TO RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS FOUND HEREIN AND IN THE ASSOCIATED LINKS.  YOU MUST  ACCESS THE LINKS TO SEE THE ENTIRE REQUIREMENT. Request For Information (RFI) DE-PS36-06GO96022 Solar America Initiative Technology Acceptance (SAI TA) Program Manager/Area: Dr. Raymond A. Sutula, Solar Energy Technologies  Program Background and Rationale: A major emphasis of the Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technology  Program (SETP) is achieving cost-competitiveness and broad  commercialization of solar electric technologies in the United States.  Achievement of these goals will diversify the Nation's electric supply  options, reduce the need for new conventional power plants, and improve  the environment.  To realize these goals as soon as possible, and ensure  the furtherance of a viable domestic solar industry, DOE is launching the  Solar America Initiative (SAI).  The mission of the SAI is to make  electricity generated by solar electric systems cost-competitive with  other electricity sources by CY2015.  For these purposes, the President  has requested an increase in funding for the SETP in FY2007 and the  Department plans to realign existing research activities so that its work  on solar electric systems is primarily focused on the goals of the SAI. For purposes of planning the SAI, the Department has used very aggressive  benchmarks for determining the levelized energy costs that SAI-funded  efforts will target for 2015:  The SETP will achieve the goals of the SAI by focusing primarily on two  areas:  (1) research and development (R&D) on photovoltaic (PV) component  and system designs, including low-cost approaches for manufacturing them;  and (2) technology acceptance activities that address marketplace barriers  and offer the opportunity for market expansion.  This Request for  Information (RFI) describes preliminary concepts and considerations in the  latter area, technology acceptance, and addresses one of the planned  funding mechanisms for work under the SAI:  the Technology Acceptance  FY2007 Financial Opportunity Announcement (FOA).  Work funded through this  planned FOA will seek to reduce non-R&D barriers that hinder market  penetration of solar electric systems, while accelerating market  expansion, to enable SAI to achieve its 2015 mission.  Activities under  the planned FOA are targeted to fall into two areas:  infrastructure  development (activities which provide technical, regulatory,  institutional, financial and educational solutions to technology  acceptance barriers) and market expansion (activities which accelerate  demand for new solar technologies through provision of technical  assistance).  Each category is divided into Topic Areas.  The SETP will  also conduct public outreach and communications activities to promote SAI,  although such efforts are not planned to be part of this FOA. DOE plans to issue this FOA in CY2006, providing sixty (60) calendar days  for applicants to formulate and submit applications.  The SETP plans to  evaluate, select, negotiate, and award financial assistance Cooperative  Agreements to multiple Applicants on a schedule that permits selection of  awardees during the Federal Government's FY2007 (commences October 1,  2007), with work initiated as soon as possible after funds are  appropriated to the SETP.  The anticipated size, quantity, and timing of  DOE-funded awards will be subject to the availability of funds. In the RFI Guidelines and Topics that follow, the SETP has outlined  strategies, objectives, and assumptions that have been formulated through  internal planning to date. It is expected that these will be augmented and  revised with the benefit of feedback from this RFI.  The SETP will also be  convening two regional Technical Exchange Meetings to facilitate external  contributions to SAI planning activities.  These meetings are tentatively  scheduled to be held in San Francisco, California and Washington, DC in  June 2006.  They will be open to participation by all external  organizations and persons on a space-limited basis.  An announcement for  the Technical Exchange Meetings, including registration instructions, will  be issued on FedBizOpps at a later date.

<SUBJECT>Request for Information, Decontaminant Applicators
<DESC>Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes (Oct 1997) (a) The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this solicitation or to otherwise pay for the information solicited except as an allowable cost under other contracts as provided in subsection 31.205-18, Bid and proposal costs, of the Federal Acquisition Regulation. (b) Although ¡§proposal¡¨ and ¡§offeror¡¨ are used in this Request for Information, your response will be treated as information only. It shall not be used as a proposal. (c) This solicitation is issued for the purpose of obtaining information on the availability of various decontamination systems as identified in the body of this Request for Informaton. (End of Provision) ________________________________________ The Joint Project Manager - Decontamination, Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense is seeking to obtain a better knowledge and understanding of industry capabilities regarding applicators for possible use in supporting operational decontamination (reduction of gross contamination to minimize transfer and contact hazard) and thorough decontamination (reduction of contamination to eliminate vapor and contact hazards) of military materiel, aircraft, naval ships, ports, and fixed facilities. Specific product performance and support information is sought on items that are currently available or are actively being pursued by industry to be available in the 2007-2010 timeframe. Information is requested on rugged systems that would withstand the harsh military environment (vibration, temperature, humidity, transport drops, blowing sand, etc) or could be readily modified to withstand these environments.  Systems should impose a minimum logistics burden (e.g. time to setup/tear down; personnel to operate and maintain; packaging handling, storage and transportation restriction; volume/weight). To maximize warfighter flexibility, it is desired that the systems be capable of applying as many of the current standard and non-standard decontaminants as possible.  These decontaminants include water, hot soapy water, High Test Hypochlorite, Super Tropical Bleach; multi-part peroxide based decontaminants (e.g. Decontamination Foam 200), ethylene glycol, other oxidizers and solvents. Information is sought on various sizes of applicators to support/perform operational and thorough decontamination of military materiel, aircraft, naval ships, ports, and fixed facilities.  These can be categorized as follows: „X	Small: Light enough to be carried by one person.   „X	Medium: Can be transported on small military vehicles (footprint less than 45¡¨ x 50¡¨) and can be safely lifted and carried by personnel (preferred), and/or safely lifted and moved with Materiel Handling Equipment. „X	Large:  Can be mounted on large military vehicles (footprint less than TBD, including decontaminant storage) and perform decontamination of equipment, facilities and terrain while on the move. „X	Fixed: Components can be transported on large military vehicles and assembled on location as a fixed system. In a decontamination scenario the systems would be used for missions of 22 of 24 hours, excluding the time to refuel/resupply the system.  The larger the system, the more capability and automation is desired. Some of the specific challenges associated with decontamination operations that JPM-Decon would like to address are:  „X	Ability to apply to the top and undercarriage of vehicles and obtain feedback that these areas have been adequately covered with decontaminant. „X	Reduce warfighter exposure to contaminated environment during decontamination operations and spashback of the decontaminant „X	Reduce manpower and support requirements  At no cost to the Government, vendors having products that they believe would be suitable for military decontamination operations as described herein shall submit four hard copies and/or an electronic copy of the product data sheets, related brochures, descriptions, or other documentation felt appropriate.   Responses should include product name, product description, manufacturer, size category (small, medium, large, fixed), approximate cost per unit, decontaminants with which the system is compatible,  length of time the product has been produced or when product is expected to be available; current uses of the system; and a point of contact should the Government desire to seek further information. Product description should include the technical characteristics such as: „X	Power requirements „X	Consumable requirement „X	Compatibility with specific decontaminants „X	Size, weight „X	Accessories „X	Environmental ranges (e.g. temperature, humidity, vibration) „X	System pressure, flow rates, heating capability etc „X	Decontaminant storage capacity (volume), „X	Manpower requirements, „X	etc Written responses are to be received by 4:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on May 31, 2006.  No telephonic responses will be considered.   The information submitted may be used in the preparation of subsequent requests for proposals.  No solicitation exists at this time.  The publication of this request or vendors¡¦ subsequent submission of product information shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government for vendors to procure equipment or to take any other action regarding this request for information.  It is also noted that the information submitted may be made available to non-Government personnel for evaluation purposes.  Therefore, submission of product information should contain the vendor¡¦s stated permission for release of this information to non-Government personnel as determined appropriate by the Joint Project Manager - Decontamination, Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical Biological Defense. Responses should be submitted to: Contracts Department P.O.

<SUBJECT>D -- Request for Industry Evaluation and Comment on the Net Enabled Command Capability (NECC) Provisional Technical Transition Architecture (PTTA)
<DESC>1.  Introduction -  The NECC is a pre-Major Automated Information System (preMAIS) program currently in the Technology Development (TD) phase of the DoD 5000 Acquisition lifecycle.  One of the technical areas to be addressed throughout the TD phase and into the System Development and Demonstration (SDD) phase is to develop and implement a Technical Transition Architecture (TTA) that will act as an evolutionary bridge from current Global Command and Control System Family of Systems (GCCS FoS) architecture to the fully integrated, net-centric NECC architecture.   2.  Purpose - The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to gather industry-wide evaluation, comment and feedback on the proposed PTTA outlined in Attachment 1.  This Attachment 1 document entitled, “The NECC Provisional Technical Transition Architecture Specification”   is available on the  DITCO Contracting Opportunities Home Page at https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp. The Government intends to use the feedback to ensure that all appropriate considerations are made for the NECC acquisition and to refine requirements for the NECC program phases. 3.  Request -  Specifically, with the key objectives of the NECC PTTA stated in Section 1.2 of Attachment 1 as a guiding assumption, the Government’s primary objective is to receive detailed analysis and responses to the following  our questions:  (a) What parts of the NECC PTTA outlined in Sections 2-5 of Attachment 1 are sufficient to achieve its objectives, and why? (b)  What parts of the NECC PTTA outlined in Sections 2-5 of Attachment 1 are necessary but not sufficient to achieve its objectives, and why? (c) What parts of the NECC PTTA outlined in Sections 2-5 of Attachment 1 are unnecessary, relative to its objectives, and why? (d)  What standards are missing from Section 3 of Attachment 1, and why?   The Government’s secondary objective is to receive detailed analysis and responses to Attachment 1 overall (such as identification and recommended resolution of conflicts within the document).  4. Timeline -  The following timeline applies to this Request for Information: (a) Submission of clarifications or questions regarding Section 3, Attachment 1, or any other section of this RFI (or any combination):  NLT 14 days after RFI release. (b) The questions submitted and responses from the Government will be  posted  on the DITCO Contracting Opportunities Home Page at https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp   NLT 21 days after RFI release. (c) Final RFI responses forwarded  to the Government:  NLT 45 days after RFI release.  4.  Other Considerations:  (a) All requests for clarification, questions and final responses must be marked with the Request for Information number and title and  be sent via email in a Microsoft Word compatible format to both of the following individuals simultaneously: Mark.Kuzma@disa.mil (703-882-1339)
and Stephen.Chadwick@disa.mil (703-882-2417):  (b) This RFI  is issued for information and planning purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for future business, an offer for procurement or any other type of current or future procurement or contractual action and is only intended to gather widespread industry input in accordance with the above Sections of this Request for Industry Evaluation and Comment document.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the RFI or to otherwise pay for information received in response to this RFI.

<DESC>(i)		This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. (ii)	Solicitation number 301816Q015 is being issued as a Commercial Item Request For Quotations (RFQ). (iii)	This solicitation document and its incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-08. (iv)	This is not a 100% Small Business Set Aside (SBSA) under Federal Acquisition Regulation 19.502-2.  However, if price and all other value factors prove to be equal, award preference will be given to a small business.  Under the defining North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code of 212312, a business is considered "small" if it, and all of its affiliates, employ a total of less than 500 persons.  For these purposes, an affiliate is defined as a business concern or individual who, directly or indirectly, (1) controls or can control the other, or (2) is a third party that controls or can control both.  (v)	[See (vi) immediately below for details of the requirement specifications]  Line Item 0001:  eighteen thousand (18,000) tons of crushed carbonate stone (hereinafter, "CCS"), delivered  between June 1, 2006 and August 1, 2006 (weather and construction progress reasonably permitting) FOB Destination by tailgate-spreading method to specific road/parking lot construction sites located within the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge.   Quotes are to include a Grand Total price consisting of a firm-fixed price Unit Price per ton, multiplied by the required 18,000 tons, for a firm-fixed price Grand Total.  Competitive evaluation for award will be based on  a quantity of 18,000 tons.  However, final remuneration will be determined by actual quantities needed by the Government (i.e., up to 10% plus or minus the 18,000 ton quantity) paid at the quoted firm fixed Unit Price. (vi)	The aforementioned CCS must conform with current Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) specification no. 703 [reviewable on the worldwide web] and the seive rates of either ODOT specification no. 410 or ODOT specification no. 411 [See http://www.dot.state.oh.us/construction/OCA/Specs/Rewrite2005/2005SpecBook/2005_410.doc and _411.doc and _703.doc].   Each quote must state the specific seive rates and kind and source of CCS offered for delivery.   In no event will Reclaimed Asphalt Concrete Pavement (RACP) or Recycled Portland Cement Concrete (RPCC) or petroleum- contaminated stone or asbestos-containing stone or radioactive or otherwise contaminated CCS be deemed a responsive product under this solicitation, due to potential negative impact on flora and fauna within the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge were any such materials to be brought on site. All delivery vehicles, as well as the delivered stone, must also be reasonably free of vegetation, to avoid introduction of exotic or noxious plant species into the Refuge. (vii)	Delivery of the crushed carbonate stone shall be made F.O.B. Destination to the Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge, located near Oak Harbor, Ohio 43449.  The only acceptable (and thus responsive) method of delivery shall be the "tailgate spread" method; such delivery shall be restricted to the exact worksite locations as directed by Refuge supervisory personnel or their authorized agents (the worksite will generally consist of two parking areas and an entrance road of about six-tenths of a mile in length).  Deliveries shall be made during the distribution period (as stated in Section v above) in coordination with the construction schedule of the entrance road and parking areas, to reasonably avoid over- or under-delivery supply problems as the project progresses. (viii)	The provision at FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors-Commercial, applies to this acquisition (FAR provisions and clauses are available for review at http://www.arnet.gov/far). (ix)	All responsible sources may submit a quotation, each of which shall be considered by the agency.  All responsive quotes shall be evaluated using the following factors, ranked in descending order of importance:  price; availability during the designated period of delivery; quality/type of CCS; and past business performance and reputation of the company or individual providing the quote (Quotes are to include contact names and telephone numbers for at least three recent customers who ordered comparable types and quantities of the offered CCS; failure to submit this information may lead to a low rating in this category of evaluation). (x)	Each offeror shall complete, and include with its quotation, FAR provision 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items.  (xi)	FAR clause 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions-Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition. (xii)	FAR clause 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraphs (1), (3), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (22)(i), (24), (29) and (31) apply to this acquisition.   (xiii)	[N/A] (xiv)	[N/A] (xv)	[N/A] (xvi)	Quotes shall be due in the FWS Region 3 CFM Office at Fort Snelling, Minnesota 55111-4056 by 4:30 p.m. CDT on May 16, 2006.  Faxed quotes may be submitted in full to Ken Kaseforth at (612) 713-5151 prior to that deadline, provided that the original, signed and dated quote package is also postmarked and mailed first class (or faster) prior to the afore-stated due date and time.

S. COAST GUARD HU-25 OXYGEN MASK REPAIR/OVERHAUL, STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES

1.0	   BACKGROUND:

The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates twenty (20) HU-25 aircraft manufactured between 1982 and 1984 by Dassault Aviation, previously, Dassault-Breguet Aviation SA-Avions Marcel.  These aircraft are used differently from general aviation as HU-25 missions frequently operate in salt laden environments.   The EROS Full Face Quick Donning Oxygen Mask, P/N MF10-03-02, manufactured by GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France, was installed in these aircraft in 1991 and serial number tracked under the Coast Guard’s Aviation Computerized Maintenance System (ACMS).  This tracking provides a historical record of repair, overhaul, maintenance, and item location and status.  

2.0	  OBJECTIVE:
            
2.1.    The Coast Guard’s objective is to obtain the services of the OEM or a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorized repair center to effectively repair and overhaul (as defined in paragraph 2) and provide complete, ready-to-install HU-25 oxygen masks.          Repaired/overhauled oxygen masks must meet the OEM’s specifications and be In  
          Accordance With (IAW) Component Maintenance Manual (CMM) 35-13-61, REV 2, 
          dated 01/31/2003 and Coast Guard Time Compliance Technical Order (TCTO) HU-25
          935030.0, dated 08/01/1992.  The Coast Guard has placed all oxygen mask parts, with
          the exception of Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC 1007-4, on condition to be replaced as
          necessary.  The Regulator Assembly, P/N RMC1007-4, requires overhaul every six (6)
          years.  GIE-EROS, Plaisir, France is the OEM.        



         The Coast Guard anticipates two (2) levels of repair.  First, a repair is considered as  
          test/inspect/return to service, as necessary.  This work consists of inspection, failure
          analysis, defective part(s) replacement (i.e., Harness Assy., Microphone Assy.,
          Hose Supply Assy., and Mask Assy.), if necessary, and testing to meet the OEM’s
          functional return to service requirements (component time continues).  Secondly, an
          overhaul is considered over and above the repair scope and includes overhaul of the
          regulator assembly and the replacement of additional parts as necessary.  An overhaul
          zeroes the Time Since Overhaul (TSO).  In addition, OEM Dust Cover P/N 59447-00 to     
          Hose Assembly P/N DTS series must be installed for both repair and overhaul.  
          The offeror shall provide a cost breakdown for parts and labor.  At a minimum, these two 
          (2) levels of service should be addressed in the offeror’s technical and cost proposal.  
          Offerors may propose additional levels of service.
           
          The prospective contractor is responsible for all necessary functions to perform the 
          services requested.  This includes, but is not limited to, required tooling, manuals, test 
          equipment, parts, material, engineering services, management, maintenance, 
          preservation, packaging, shipping, etc., to repair/overhaul the oxygen masks. 
         
       The prospective contractor’s responsibilities to the Coast Guard ACMS consist of 
       ensuring that the significant component history corresponds with the component, and that 
       all OEM Service Bulletins and Coast Guard TCTOs remain incorporated upon 
       completion of work.  

       Under a performance-based contract structure, performance metrics and service level 
                      agreements will be used to monitor the performance of this contract.  The prospective 
                      contractor will develop, submit and monitor progress using agreed-to performance 
                      metrics and service level agreements.
     
 2.2.   Definitions

                   2.2.1. Level I Repair: Work consists of inspection, failure analysis, defective part(s)  
                                replacement (if necessary) and testing to meet the OEM’s functional return to 
                                service requirements.  Repair does not zero the component time.

                   2.2.2. Level II Repair: Overhaul – considered over and above the Level I Repair scope 
                                and includes overhaul of the regulator assembly and the replacement of additional 
                                parts as necessary.  Overhaul zeros the component Time Since Overhaul (TSO).

4.0    SERVICE BULLETINS

            All service bulletins if not previously accomplished, shall be identified to the Contracting 
            Officer.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining service bulletins.   Upon receipt of an
            oxygen mask requiring incorporation of such service bulletins, the contractor shall prepare a
            firm-fixed-price proposal IAW instructions listed below.  Service bulletins created and
            incorporated during performance of this requirement may create new part number 
            configurations, which supercede the previous configuration.  In cases where the old
            configuration cannot be modified to the new, the new part number shall be added to the
            contract, by written modification.  The contractor shall notify and request disposition
            instructions from the Contracting Officer for superceded parts, which have been removed and
            replaced by new part number configurations.

Upon receipt of notification from the Contracting Officer that a service bulletin is required, the Contractor shall submit, within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of the notification, a firm-fixed-price proposal for an incremental charge to be assessed each time the service bulletin is incorporated in a component.  The proposal shall contain a breakdown of material and labor costs including hours, labor categories, labor rates, and applicable mark ups.  The incremental charge agreed to for incorporation of a service bulletin shall apply only to those components into which the Contractor incorporates a required service bulletin, not those into which the service bulletin has been previously incorporated.  Upon agreement of an incremental charge and issuance of a contract modification to reflect this change, the service bulletin shall be incorporated into each subsequent component received at the repair facility if said service bulletin has not already been incorporated.  When service bulletin incorporation changes the Contract Line Item Number (CLIN) part number, the new part number shall be added to the                     Contract, by written modification.

52.212-2	Evaluation – Commercial Items (Jan 1999)

The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Award will be made utilizing the following factors, in descending order of importance.  The Coast Guard intends to award one contract to the Contractor whose quote is identified as offering the best value solution.

                    The Source Selection Team (SST) may determine the best value for the Coast Guard
               merits a higher price based on technical superiority.  The SST, using sound business 
               judgment, will base the selection decision on an integrated assessment of the proposal’s 
               relative capability as measured against the below evaluation factors:

		     Factor 1 – Technical
                       Factor 2 – Performance Metrics
                       Factor 3 – Past Performance
                       Factor 4 – Cost/Price

	         Technical factors 1 and 2 are equal in importance and significantly more important than  
                     factor 3. While the cost/price is an important part of the integrated selection decision, the 
                     non-price factors (1, 2 and 3) are significantly more important than the price factor. 
                     However, as technical proposal become substantially equal, price may be the determining 
                     factor in selecting a proposal for award. Any conversations with the present or former 
                     customers will be documented.

Enclosure (1)

DETAILED FACTORS

1.  Technical

Vendors detailed work statement. Evidence and ability to maintain a quality system acceptable to   
 the Coast Guard. Repair must meet the Original Equipment Manufacturer’s (OEM) form, fit and 
 function specifications to ensure installation and operational characteristics are met. 

2.  Performance Measures and Metrics

     The performance measures and metrics will be evaluated for the extent they are comprehensive in 
      their ability to quantify, measure, track, and report operational performance relating to both system 
      and management performance as well achievement of Coast Guard objectives, identify the highest 
      level of service consistent with cost effectiveness, and will be tied to performance incentives and 
      disincentives that are directly related to meeting or exceeding mission critical performance metrics.

3.  Past Performance

      Past Performance will consider documentation for having performed repair of similar or like items.
      Past performance will consider the opinions of existing and former customers during the past 2 
      years. The past performance factor will be based on adherence to ability to perform a successful 
      repair, delivery schedule, willingness and ability of contractor to resolve problems. Great care 
      needs to be exercised so that “past performance” information is considered under the appropriate 
      heading and not confused with “technical”.

4.  Price related factors

Compare offered prices against the Government estimate and review each proposal for level of work offered based on number of labor hours, hourly rates and material costs to evaluate price reasonableness.  Determine if the Incentive/Disincentive program offered is acceptable to the USCG.  Evaluating what the program is to measure and how it is to be tracked and monitored.

(c)  Special rules.  The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.

                              as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in

(i)  stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign 
      incorporated entity; or

(3) Certain Transfers Disregarded.  The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purposes of this section.

(d)  Special Rule For Related Partnerships.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, and independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

<DESC>The US Army Office of the Project Manager Maneuver Ammunition (OPM MAS) Systems has a requirement for technical support services in the area of developing a â€œcapability gapâ€ on the lethality requirements for the Abrams.  Within the last 18 months, Army Leadership has projected the longevity and service life of  the platform to the 2045 timeframe.  The extension of the service life requires  Abrams to be modernized and integrated into the Future Combat Systems (FCS)  network to support the future force.  Consequently, increased coordination  between PM MAS and TRADOC System Manager (TSM) Abrams is necessary to properly  integrate, communicate and develop future requirements/capabilities for the Abrams.  This will require working with the Abrams, Ammunition, TSM, and Unit  of Action Maneuver Battle Lab (UAMBL) communities to identify and define the  requirements to fill the gaps in terms of ammunition for the accompanying  platform modernization (i.e. fire control system, breech, gun, etc). OPM MAS  intends to award a SOLE SOURCE contract modification to Fast Track Technologies  for this additional work under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, avoidance of  duplication of cost and unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agencyâ€™s requirements.  Currently, Fast Track Technologies supports UAMBL in the same  capacity for the FCS Mounted Combat System (MCS) ammunition development and integration.  This notice does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed  as a commitment by the Government.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>This Performance Work Statement (PWS) details the requirement efforts to provide the Joint Directorate of Military Support (JDOMS/J3) and the Adjutant General (TAG) of Florida, Florida National Guard (FLNG) with Domestic Operations functional consult ation expertise for a full range of Military Support/Defense Support to Civil Authorities (MSCA/DSCA) issues.  This requirement is restricted and has been set-aside for 100% small business participation.  The associated NAICS is 541611, $6.0 Million. The G overnment intends to award a non-professional services contract with a base year plus two options years.  The government intends to award without discussions based on price as described in the statement of work; therefore, the offerors initial proposal sha ll contain its best terms.  This PWS provides Domestic Operations planning and operational consultant expertise to the FLNG by furnishing additional management support, liaison and research in new areas of Domestic Operations policies, training, personnel,  materials, equipment (except Government furnished equipment) and knowledge to perform the tasks.  The contractor will provide the FLNG with expertise as a result of the past two hurricane seasons and knowledge of NORTHCOM's new mode of operation.  The con tract also provides direct consultation with National Guard Bureau (NGB) to establish new procedures, policies and new training venues on domestic operations.
