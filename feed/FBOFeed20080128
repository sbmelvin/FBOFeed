<ARCHDATE>01272009
<CONTACT>Washington Bennett  8015243853     wbennett@uc.usbr.gov;
<DESC>Curecanti Field Division Mobile Crane Requirement: 	A mobile crane is required for emergencies and maintenance of the structures located in the Curecanti Field Division. The facilities include Blue Mesa Dam and Power House, Morrow Point Dam and Power House, Crystal Dam and Power House, Upper Molina Power House, and Lower Molina Power House. Due to the fact that these facilities are located up to 100 miles between the farthest facilities. A crane that is able to move easily between facilities is required.   	Blue Mesa Dam Requirements: "	The Blue Mesa Dam intake structure is located 110 ft. from shore, and is accessed by a bridge with weight restrictions of 75,000 lb. Potential contractors should note that if the proposed equipment exceeds the 75,000 lb weight restriction on the bridge structure, it is the responsibility of the potential contractor to provide an appropriate solution. The structure itself is very limited on the space that is useable to set a crane. The structure can not be modified to accommodate extended outriggers. The work required at the intake structure is critical to the mission of the Dam. Stop logs weighing approximately 30,000 lbs must be able to be set in an emergency and for required maintenance. Because of the positioning of the crane and the proximity of the gate house, a crane capable of lifting 30,000 lbs from a depth of 155 ft below the deck at a radius of 22 ft is required to do the lift. Another limiting factor is the length of the crane between outriggers from front to back. The weight of the crane must not be allowed to go onto the bridge. The crane must then be able to swing the load completely around to the rear of the crane to position the stop log onto a lowboy trailer (360 degree capability) for removal from the structure.  Crystal Dam Requirements: "	The Crystal Dam intake structure is located on top of the Dam. Because of the restrictive width of the top of Dam a crane must be capable of making the required lifts while sitting on the crest of the dam. The crane is required for setting of stop logs in case of emergency and required maintenance. Lifts necessary at Crystal Dam intake structure are a gate weighing 30,000 at a radius of 19ft., stop logs for the bypass tubes weighing 11,860 lbs. at a radius of 14 ft., stop logs for the penstock intake structure weighing 23,550 lbs at a radius of 28 ft. All of these lifts must be done with the crane in line with the center of the pick due to the slope of the dam face. The crane must be able to boom up and down to hold the gates in their tracks as they are lowered or raised. To access the crest of Crystal Dam, crane must be able to fit thru an access tunnel that is 20 ft wide, 13 ý ft tall, with a 12ft radius ceiling. See the attached drawing of tunnel elevation view. Morrow Point Dam Requirements: "	A crane is required for setting of stop logs in case of emergency and required maintenance. Lifts necessary at Morrow Point Dam are the spillway gate stop logs weighing approximately 20,500 lbs. and the river outlet tube stop log weighing 11,860 lbs. at a radius of 20 ft. There are several access doors on the face of the dam that require material and equipment to be lowered from the top of dam for maintenance. These doors are located directly beneath the narrow part of the dam crest. The crane must be able to operate with an on-rubber chart as the crest width in these areas is 12 ft. Upper and Lower Molina Requirements: "	No special requirements needed. Attached are drawings of Blue Mesa intake structure setup, Crystal dam crest set up, Crystal Dam access tunnel, and a photo of the Blue Mesa intake structure. The physical dimensions and lifting requirements for these facilities are very restrictive. The crane must be able to make the required lifts with the crane set up in the areas shown in the attached drawings. The specifications and options listed below are based on a Liebherr LTC 1055-3.1 mobile crane. Crane standard features and options are to be equal to, or exceed the specifications listed below. Curecanti Field Division must approve the selected potential contractors crane specifications to insure standard features and options are equal to, or exceed the ones below. Standard Specifications: Crane Carrier (Name brand or equal salient characteristics) "	Supporting System - 4-point system, extendable hydraulically into horizontal and vertical direction. "	Axles - All axles steered, must accommodate on-road and off-road speeds. "	Steering - ZF-Hydro-SERVOCOM steering, or equivalent. Steering in accordance with EC recommendation 70/311/EWG, or equivalent "	Brakes - Service brake: All-wheel. Parking brake: acts on wheels of the 2nd and 3rd axle. Retarder: Exhaust brake or equivalent. ABV: (anti lock device), brakes in accordance with EC recommendation 71/320 EWG or equivalent. "	Electric system - Control of the electric and electronic components by modern data bus technology, 24 volt direct current, 2 batteries of 170 Ah each, lighting in accordance with STVZO or equivalent. Crane Superstructure "	The Frame must accommodate counterweights and continuous rotation. "	Engine-Diesel engine.  "	Crane drive -hydraulic capable of simultaneous operation of 4 working movements, with noise abatement. "	Armrest-integrated control. "	Driver's and crane operator's cab -  Enclosed in safety glass and air conditioning  "	Safety devices - LICCON or equivalent safe load indicator, test system, hoist limit switches, safety valves to prevent pipe and hose ruptures. "	Telescopic boom - Length must accommodate picking requirements without the use of jibs "	Counterweight - as needed. Other Requirements "	Operator manuals 4 total "	Training for 4 operators The solicitation for this procurement will be posted on February 2, 2008.

<DESC>NOTICE OF CONTRACT ACTION (NOCA) -Air Force Subscale Aerial Targets (AFSAT) Post Lot 5 Contract - The Air Armament Center, 308th Armament Systems Wing, 691st Armament Systems Squadron, Contracts Office, Eglin AFB FL is planning to award in FY 09 a sole source follow-on contract to Composite Engineering Inc. (CEi), located at 5381 Raley Blvd, Sacramento, CA 92632 for procurement of BQM-167A subscale aerial targets and associated support (ie. support equipment, spares, engineering support, studies, etc.).  These targets will be used by the 53rd Weapons Evaluation Group (WEG) to test and evaluate air-to-air weapon systems and for evaluation/training exercises such as WILLIAM TELL on the Gulf Range Complex and other authorized Department of Defense (DoD) test ranges.  The Government does not own a technical data package and/or software data rights for the BQM-167A target system and its peculiar support equipment and therefore cannot provide this data to interested parties.
DoD has a need for a subscale aerial target that meets the following performance requirements: a) Endurance, 60 minutes (mins) at 15,000 ft, 30 mins of the 60 mins at military power (Key Performance Parameter (KPP)); b) Minimum to Maximum Airspeed Range, 250 Knots Calibrated Air Speed (KCAS) to 0.90M at 15,000 ft (KPP); c) Payload Carriage, Total 300 pounds (lbs) (KPP), Internal 100 lbs, plus Growth Capacity (KPP), Wing Stress (Pounds Per Wing) 150 lbs; d) Formation Flights of 2, 3 and 4 targets (KPP); e) Operating Environment, day and night, visual and instrument meteorological conditions (VMC and IMC); f) Ground Launch Wind Restrictions, 50 Knots (knts) headwind, 20 knts crosswind, 28 knts tailwind; g) Launch, Land; h) Recovery, Land and Water; i) Sustained +6.0 g at 10,000 feet; j) Sustained Turn Rate at 10,000 feet (10 degrees per second); k) Operating Altitude, 50 ft AGL to 50,000 ft;  l) Visual Acquisition, equal to or greater than 3 nautical miles; m) Aspect Angle Determination , equal to or greater than 1.5 nautical miles; n) Visual Augmentation Systems, Smoke, Paint, and Strobe Lights; o) Payloads (systems), shall be pre-wired and capable of carrying and operating the Luneberg Lens, ALE-47, M-130, ULQ-21 Components, DLQ-9, APC-4 IR Pods and ALE-50; p) Target Control System (TCS) Compatibility (Gulf Range Drone Control System (GRDCS)), Air Force TCS; q) TCS Operation, Fly Automated Maneuvers and Can Be Manually Operated;  r) TCS Hold Commanded Heading ? 5 degrees; Hold Commanded Altitude, ? 200 ft; Hold Commanded Airspeed ? 10 knts; s) Scoring System, AN/DPQ-9 VDOPS; t) IFF Modes, 3/A and C; u) Probability of Mission Success for 60 minute mission, 0.95; v) Availability, Probability the subscale target will pass all functional checks prior to a mission, 0.90. w) Threat Representative Maneuvers, subscale target must be capable of performing single-ship repeatable consecutive threat representative maneuvers with the ability to terminate the maneuver on command.  These maneuvers include, but are not limited to barrel roll, pitch-back, slice-back, split-S, low-altitude penetration break turns, weave, pop-up, escape and loss of signal maneuvers. 

The BQM-167A meets the above requirements and is capable of being modified to meet objective requirements.  The BQM-167A utilizes multiple pieces of drone-unique peculiar support equipment.  The BQM-167A subscale target is interoperable with the existing Air Force drone facility and range systems at Tyndall AFB FL, and no major modifications to existing drone facility, range, support equipment or additional manpower are required to support the BQM-167A subscale target.  CEi has the capability to provide depot level supply support, repair and maintenance as well as operation and maintenance (O&M) manuals in accordance with (IAW) TMCR 86-01 and O&M training for the target system.  CEi is capable of meeting the production schedule, which is critical for this procurement.  Contract award is anticipated no later than (NLT) Feb 2009, and deliveries at a rate of approximately four (4) subscale targets per month must start NLT Apr 2010 in order to maintain adequate subscale targets inventory to support Air Force requirements.  In addition, each lot option may include the following provisions:  

(a) Procurement of a variable quantity ranging from 1 to 72 targets with a best estimated quantity of 40 targets per lot, (b) Depot level logistic support, (c) Extended Warranty, (d) On-site technical representative at Tyndall AFB FL, (e) Spares provisioning (f) Peculiar Support Equipment (g) storage capability for up to 1-72 targets at the contractors facility (h) Sustaining engineering (i) Studies and Product Improvements. The contract shall include provisions for conducting product improvements to enhance target system performance beyond threshold requirements.  The Air Force has no development funding to develop, demonstrate and test a subscale target.  CEi is able to meet target performance and schedule requirements with no developmental effort. 
The appropriate North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this proposed acquisition is 336411 with a size standard of 1,500 employees.  The government has determined that the only way to prevent any adverse impact to critical mission activities that could result from a break in the continuous availability of sub-scale aerial targets is to issue a follow-on contract to the incumbent vendor.  The government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  This synopsis neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the government to any specific acquisition approach. This synopsis should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.  As directed by the Foreign Disclosure Office, Eglin AFB FL, no foreign participation shall be allowed for this effort.  An Ombudsman has been appointed to address concerns of offerors or potential offerors. The Ombudsman does not diminish the authority of the program manager or contracting officer but communicates contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate Government personnel.  When requested, the Ombudsman shall maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern.  The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process.  Matters of routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should not be addressed to the Ombudsman but rather to the Contracting points of contact identified above. The Ombudsman is Brig Gen Michael N. Wilson,  AAC/CR and the alternate is Col Brian D. Buel, AAC/CS both located at 101 West D Avenue, Suite 116, Eglin AFB, FL 32542-5422.

<DESC>RICHARD BOLLING FEDERAL BUILDING RENOVATION (IMO10450)
601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri
GS06P08GZC0003


The General Services Administration announces an opportunity for Construction Excellence in Public Building.  The following document describes the Construction Manager as Constructor (CMc) Contract for the continuation of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building; the Interior Renovation of the Federal Building in Kansas, MO.  The scope includes Pre-Construction Phase Services and the option for the Construction Phase Services.  A Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) contract for the Pre-Construction Phase Services and a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) Option with Construction Contingency Allowance for the Construction Phase Services is contemplated.  The CMc will be competitively chosen using Source Selection (FAR 15.3) procedures.  For this contract, technical evaluation factors, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price (see FAR 15.101-1 trade offs).

Definition of Construction Manager as Constructor:  A CMc is defined as a firm engaged under direct contract to a building owner or client, in this case the General Services Administration (GSA), to provide design review, cost estimating, scheduling and general construction services.  The CMc shall be a member of the project development team during the design and construction phases, along with GSA as owner/developer and GSA's A-E firm.  At the time of contract award, the CMc?s firm price for pre-construction and pricing for construction phase services, will form the basis of the contract.  In accordance with the successive targets, the CMc shall guarantee a maximum project price based on the facility described in the Government?s construction documents and Request for Proposal (RFP) package.  The services requested of the CMc shall cover a wide range of design and construction activities, which are often performed by both Construction Managers (CM) and General Contractors (GC).  In contrast to a CM that is not also a constructor, the CMc is responsible, through design review, involvement in the project development and administration of the construction, for constructing the facility described by the Government at or below the defined budget ? the project Estimated Construction Cost, or ECC.

Price Range: $70,000,000 to $80,000,000.

This project is a continuation of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 96,151 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated award range is $70,000,000 to $80,000,000.  Completion time is approximately 1700 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed.  To be considered eligible for award the contractor must meet the following minimum requirements.  Experience demonstrating that firm has worked on a similar or partially similar project ? defined as (1) an interior office renovation or other renovation project with a high level of interior finishes and complexity (new construction projects will not be evaluated); and (2) having experience acting in a CMc capacity; and (3) having a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate. 

This project will be limited to floors 1 through 3, 17, Ground Floor, Basement Floor, and Sub-Basement Floor, complete window replacement, complete the exterior caulking at the Annex, replace Annex roof, new perimeter site work, and new exterior building lighting.  The building will be occupied during construction.  Base Bid Work, including but not limited to:  General demolition, including asbestos and lead paint abatement; reconfiguration of existing shaft openings; seismic bracing of shaft walls; complete renovation of lobbies and restrooms including reconfiguration of restrooms; wood paneling, terrazzo, drywall partitions, paint and plaster, new ceramic tile walls and floors; new ceilings, lighting and above ceiling HVAC throughout the floors; removal of existing windows and providing and installing new windows; modification of fire alarm system; new building signage/graphics; stairway egress improvements; and Building Automation System work.  Option Bid Work:  Including, but not limited to tenant improvements including new drywall partitions, doors, frames and hardware, plaster, paint, vinyl tile, carpet and vinyl base, casework, new panel boards, tenant power distribution and data drops; seal and caulk building exterior; and meeting certification standards to qualify for a LEED Certified rating.  Phased substantial completion dates are required.

Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos or lead paint abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  The Government intends to use the ?trade-off process? in selecting the prime contractor.  The ?trade-off process? is a method of evaluating both the technical factors specified in the solicitation and the price.  The Government intends to award the contract to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and is most advantageous to the Government, with technical factors being considered more important than price. The object is to select the proposal that offers best value. The RFP will consist of two packages to be submitted at the same time; a technical proposal and a price proposal.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm (including knowledge of local construction market), (2) Experience and Qualifications of Key Personnel, (3) Management Plan, and (4) Sustainable Construction Practices, Materials and Methods.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  Price proposal packages of offerors will then be evaluated.  Offerors should submit proposals that are acceptable without additional information, as the Government may make the final determination regarding a proposal?s acceptability based solely on the initial proposal submitted. The Government may proceed with the award of the contract without discussion. However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  If discussions are necessary, the Government will establish a competitive range.  Offerors who fall within the competitive range may be asked to submit a subcontracting plan and special competency requirements.  As proposals become more equal in their technical merits, price then becomes more important.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation, and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price that is the most advantageous to the Government. The Government will evaluate all proposals that meet the minimum requirements.  

The RFP includes a general scope of work and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Project Management Division, will not mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.

The funds available for awards in each program element offered in this NRA range from less than one to several million dollars, which allow selection from a few to as many as several dozen proposals depending on the program objectives and the submission of proposals of merit. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers depending on the nature of the proposing organization and/or program requirements. The typical period of performance for an award is four years, although a few programs may specify shorter or longer periods. Participation is open to all categories of organizations, foreign and domestic, including educational institutions, industry, nonprofit organizations, NASA centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and other Government agencies, without restriction on number or teaming arrangements. Note that it is NASA policy that all investigations involving non-U.S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds.  Proposal due dates are scheduled starting on May 9, 2008, and continue through March 27, 2009.  Electronically submitted Notices of Intent to propose are requested for most program elements, with the first such due date being March 14, 2008.  Electronic submission of proposals is required by the respective due dates for each program element and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization.  Electronic proposals may be submitted via the NASA proposal data system NSPIRES or via Grants.gov.  Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES; organizations that intend to submit proposals via Grants.gov must also be registered with Grants.gov.  Such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal.  All principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators) must be registered in NSPIRES.  Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information.     Further information about specific program elements may be obtained from the individual Program Officers listed in the Summary of Key Information for each program element in this NRA, while questions concerning general NRA policies and procedures may be directed to Dr. Yvonne Pendleton, Senior Advisor for Research and Analysis, Science Mission Directorate, NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC 20546-0001; E-mail: sara@nasa.gov; Telephone: 202-358-1182.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, NOAA, National Weather Service (NWS), Climate Predication Center, (CPC) intends to negotiate on sole source basis, under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 6.302 Other Than Full and Open Competition, with the Environmental Systems Research International Institute, Inc. 380 New York Street, Redlands, CA  92373-8100, to provide proprietary software maintenance for ESRI ArcGIS, ArcINFO, and ArcView.  The Government anticipates a firm fixed-price contract for a twelve (12) month period from date of award and two (2) twelve (12) month option periods.  ArcGIS is a product suite consisting of desktop and server products ranging from ArcView to ArcINFO for desktop products and ArcIMS and ArcGIS server for server based products.  The (CPC) currently uses ArcGIS desktop and server products.   CPC has 13 licenses for  ArcVIEW, 3 Licenses for ArcINFO and one server license for ArcGIS Server and ArcIMS.  ESRI?s ArcGIS product suite also includes extensions or additions to the base product.  The (CPC) is using ArcView and ArcINFO for interactive (manual) product generations along with extensions.  The ArcGIS product suite is the premier Geographic Information System product, and is used extensively and to a great extent exclusively by the USGS, USDA and NOS (part of NOAA).  Currently we share both information and products with the USGS, USDA, USAF, and FEWS (Part of the U.S. Department of State).    We have extremely close relationship with the USDA and even maintain an office (JAWF) staffed with 3 NWS employees located in the USDA facility in Washington, D.C.  Both the USGS and USDA will be supplying code in AML (ArcINFO Macro Language) which is unique to ArcINFO and ArcObjects which is common to both ArvView and ArcINFO.  This transfer of code has and will continue to result in significant savings in time and will minimize the effort it will take to produce the required products.  CPC is currently transitioning to a server based GIS system which will increase the productivity of the ArcGIS desktop products and allow our users and forecasters access to GIS products using a web browser such as Microsoft Explorer or Firefox.

ArcINFO is the highest tier of the ArcGIS product suite and allows automation and input of multiple types of data whereas ArcView allows for most editing and processing of our data where Visual Basic or phython can be used.  The USGS and USDA have developed a complete set of programs to automate most of their products including many products that we share development on.  This request is to continue the maintenance, update services, and telephone (or mail support) that CPC is relying on for support for our products.  Continuation of support will allow CPC to meet the needs of our partners and stay compatible with the scripts and methods that our partners share with us.  Current software is needed to allow CPC to fulfill or commitment for participation in the production of the North America Drought product along with additional products supplied to the USDA, US Department of State (the FEWS program), and the US Air Force all of which need to be supplied in a GIS format.

Currently ArcGIS (ArcINFO, ArcView, ArcGIS servers and there associated extension) is the ONLY suite of products that can fulfill all of our needs.  ArcGIS is both patented and copyrighted by ESRI and ESRI is the only supplier for ArcGIS.

Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government?s requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates a proven satisfactory ability to provide these services to permit agency analysis.  A determination by the Government not to open this requirement to competition based upon the responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government. This acquisition will be issued in accordance with FAR PART 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Affirmative written responses must be received not later than 25 January 2008.  Please submit any and all written responses to Mark.A.Miller@noaa.gov or Grace.E.Carter-Tyer@noaa.gov.  See Note 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Appropriation:  Operation and Maintenance (O&M), Fish and Wildlife Program.<BR><BR>3.  Purpose and Scope:  The proposed research activities are to evaluate post release performance of natural and hatchery Clearwater  River fall Chinook salmon.  The 2004 NOAA Fisheries Biological Opinion calls for an evaluation of the effectiveness of transportation for improving survival of the ESA listed natural Snake River fall Chinook salmon.  The Updated Proposed Actions for the F CRPS indicates that a comprehensive evaluation of fall Chinook transportation is planned to begin in 2007/2008.  There are numerous complex issues surrounding Snake River fall Chinook salmon and the development of an overall transportation study.  The Wall a Walla District needs additional marking of natural Clearwater River fall Chinook salmon to compare the performance of hatchery fish as substitutes for natural fish.  This information will help determine if hatchery fish can be used in transportation and other migration behavior and life history studies.  This research supports the Operation of the Federal Power System in the 2000 National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion under the Endangered Species Act, Section 7 Consultation, Actions items 42 , 46, 47, 48, 51, and 185. The work will be done in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service, Idaho Fishery Resource Office, who will rear surrogate fish at the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery to natural size and release them into the Clearwater Rive r in 2008.  <BR><BR>This research requires specialized coordination from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Idaho Fishery Resource Office), the Nez Perce Tribe, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Idaho Departmen t of Fish and Game, the Umatilla Tribe, and the Columbia River Inter-tribal Fish Commission as outlined in the 2008 Consensus Research Proposal, Evaluating the Responses of Snake and Columbia River Basin fall Chinook Salmon to Dam Passage Strategies and E xperiences.  Fieldwork to supplement sampling and PIT tagging of natural Clearwater River fall Chinook salmon must begin by early-May 2008 to sample the peak outmigration period (approximately May-June) on the Clearwater River. The Nez Perce Tribe has samp led, PIT tagged, and collected natural Clearwater River fall Chinook salmon life history data since 1991.  Information is required to determine if hatchery fish  can be raised to perform as natural surrogates in the Clearwater River.  <BR><BR>4.	Nez Perce Tribe Obligation: <BR><BR>a.	The Nez Perce Tribe will conduct the following research objectives.<BR><BR>All work described within the proposal covers the 2008 ca lendar year, with the exception of draft and final reports.  <BR><BR>Objective 2	Compare the post-release performance of natural fall Chinook salmon subyearlings from the Snake and Clearwater rivers to hatchery fall Chinook salmon subyearlings released in these rivers as natural fish surrogates for transportation studies.  <BR><BR>Task 2.1	Culture, tag, and release surrogate group:  Coordinate and assist as needed the Fish and Wildlife Service, Idaho Fishery Resource Office in PIT tagging and release of up to 130,000 surrogate experimental release group into the Clearwater River.<BR><BR>Task 2.2	Scheduling surrogate tagging and release:  Use historical data collected during the 2001  2007 field seasons by the Nez Perce Tribe and 2007/08 Clearwater River inc ubating water temperatures to develop a regression model for predicting the median date 70-75 mm natural fall Chinook are present along the Clearwater River shorelines.  Trap natural fall Chinook during 2008 in the lower Clearwater River and provide empiri cal data to model and plan the best release timing of hatchery surrogates to match the median date of presence of natural fish.<BR><BR>Task 2.3	PIT Tag natural fall Chinook in the Clearwater River:  Conduct supplemental sampling to increase the number of n atural fall Chinook salmon presently collected and implanted with PIT tags in the Clearwater River as part of the on-going Bonneville Power Administration funded study.  The goal is to increase the number of natural fish tagged by up to 8,000 in the Clearw ater River.  Conduct a pilot study in 2008 to PIT tag up to 10,000 natural fish that are 40-60mm in length using the smaller 8.5mm PIT tag.  A random sub sample of 100 wild fish captured during the supplemental sampling in the Clearwater River will be caud al fin clipped to determine genetic lineage.<BR><BR>Task 2.4	Assigning treatment groups:  Treatment groups will be coordinated with National Marine Fisheries Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nez Perce Tribe.  Treatment groups will be developed fr om historical data modeling, median fish presence, and sampling efficiency.<BR><BR>b.	Field Schedule:  The Nez Perce Tribe will assist the Fish and Wildlife Service, IFRO in rearing Lyons Ferry Hatchery fall Chinook salmon at the Dworshak National Fish Hat chery beginning February 2008.  Sampling and PIT tagging natural Snake River and Clearwater River fall Chinook salmon will occur May - July 2008.

<DESC>RFP CANCELLATION NOTICE The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Department of Health and Human Services Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), will not issue RFP-NIH-DAIT-BARDA-08-20 entitled "GLP Radionuclide/Radiation Animal Models and Resources" at this time.  This RFP is being postponed indefinitely.

GLP Radionuclide/Radiation Animal Models and Resources Development
RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BARDA-08-20
Formerly Announced as RFP-NIH-NIAID-DAIT-BARDA-08-09.

The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH), of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) supports research related to the basic understanding of microbiology and immunology leading to the development of vaccines, therapeutics, and medical diagnostics for the prevention, treatment, and diagnosis of infectious and immune-mediated diseases.  The NIAID, Division of Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation (DAIT) and The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) have a requirement to develop medical therapies and diagnostics to counter radiological and nuclear threats.
Description 
Radiation injury can be caused by external or internal exposure, and the effects of radiation on the body may appear within minutes or develop many years after exposure. Internal exposure occurs when radionuclides are internalized by inhalation, ingestion, or through contaminated wounds and distributed to sensitive tissues.  The primary treatment to minimize internal exposure is the elimination of internal radionuclides through the administration of chelating, decorporating, or blocking agents.  There is a need for the continued development of decorporation agents.

The Offeror will provide the required services including the following: development of an information base and rodent and non-rodent animal models of internal radionuclide contamination, development of rodent and non-rodent screen and efficacy evaluation animal models, and GLP-compliant radionuclide exposure facilities.  The animal models that are to be developed are intended to support future GLP pivotal animal efficacy studies with an eventual goal of supporting licensure of decorporation agents or other treatments of radionuclide internal contamination.
The work to be performed under this contract will be initiated by the NIAID Contracts Office through a mechanism called work assignments.  The Government intends to establish contracts for two facilities to carry out the efforts described above.
Adherence to the PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (PHS Policy) is a term and condition of all PHS grant or contract awards that includes use of live, invertebrate animals.  Both OLAW and AAALAC accreditations demonstrate compliance with PHS Policy.  The USDA regulates institutions performing research on warm-blooded species other than rodents and birds and must comply with the Animal Welfare Act and Regulations.  Any research facility using radioactive materials in scientific research studies must comply with appropriate federal and state licensing requirements.

It is anticipated that two work assignment type contracts will be awarded for a five (5)-year period of performance beginning on or about September 30, 2008, with an anticipated total effort of approximately 6.35 FTEs. 

Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.   This RFP will be available electronically on/about January 3, 2008 and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  

This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted. See Government-Wide Numbered Note 26.

<DESC>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VISN 3) Healthcare Network intends to negotiate a multi-award agreement with the following Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved General Services Administration (GSA) companies to provide control and preventative measures for the active surveillance of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): Cepheid, 904 Caribbean Drive Sunnyvale, California 94089 for its GeneXpert System.  The GeneXpert System combines sample preparation with real-time PCR amplification and detection for fully integrated and automated nucleic acid analysis.  The systemýýýs capability enables users to perform up to 16 different molecular tests concurrently.  Specimens can be processed as they come in, 24/7, 365 days a year. BD Diagnostics GeneOhm, 6146 Nancy Ridge Drive San Diego, California 92121 for its Smart Cycler Desktop System.  The Smart Cycler Desktop System provides the government with a cost-effective, accurate and rapid means to detect MRSA colonization.  In accordance with the FDA "Cleared Packages Inserts", the BD GeneOhm MRSA Assay provides superior performance with a sensitivity of 92.5%.  In cases of "unresolved specimens", the BD GeneOhm MRSA allows the user the ability to repeat the PCR using frozen lysate, as opposed to collecting a second swab from the patient.   Clinical research indicates that the implementation of universal surveillance, which introduces the testing of all admitted patients, is far more effective than just passive or targeted active surveillance when monitoring for Methicillin-Resistant Staphyloccus aureus (MRSA).  The purpose of this acquisition is to reduce and or mitigate the spread of Methicillin-Resistant Staphyloccus aureus (MRSA) throughout VISN 3ýýýs Healthcare Network through active surveillance of cultures.  The procurement of the outlined product offerings will add the required value in the management of multi-drug resistant organisms within VISN 3.

<CONTACT>Kathleen Jones, 703-325-1723
<DESC>No changes are made to the request for information.  If you are having difficulty reading the data due to format, please email the POCs for a copy of this notice in word format.  <BR> 1.	BACKGROUND INFORMATION<BR>1.1	Purpose<BR>The purpose of this Re quest for Information (RFI) is to provide industry, government service providers, and other interested parties a vehicle to describe solution(s) and implementation approaches for an enterprise-wide funds distribution capability for the Department of Defens e (DoD). Responses to this RFI will assist the Enterprise Funds Distribution (EFD) initiative incorporate best-practice strategies, alternatives, and experiences into an Acquisition strategy for developing and implementing an enterprise-wide solution(s) fo r the Department. <BR>1.2	Description<BR>The EFD initiative was established in 2006 as a key initiative to provide full visibility of funds distributed throughout the DoD and to streamline and modernize disparate funds distribution systems.  At an enterpri se level, there exist gaps and inefficiencies among the separate and distinct funds distribution practices throughout the Department.  Funds distribution by its nature should be a key enabler of financial visibility within DoD enterprise systems.  The conc ept of a fully visible enterprise-wide funds distribution capability serves as a reference within which planned and coordinated funds development and execution takes place.  <BR>Specific objectives of the EFD initiative are to transform the Departments fu nds management and distribution capabilities to provide:<BR>"	Full visibility and auditability of appropriated funds as they pass through and across the enterprise;<BR>"	Streamlined funds distribution processes for all appropriations and standardize funds distribution data;<BR>"	Integrated funds distribution and Congressional Marks tracking processes to provide significantly enhanced funds distribution visibility.<BR>"	Flexibility of the Business Rules associated with the funds distribution<BR>1.3	Scope<BR> EFD capabilities are primarily required by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and DoD Components from the time the Presidents Budget is submitted to Congress until appropriated funds are apportioned and allocated to the Components.  During that timefr ame, EFD capabilities enable tracking of congressional actions, establishment of budget authority, and the distribution of funds to the Components.  <BR>Specific EFD capabilities include apportionment processing, funds distribution and redistribution of ap propriated funds, reprogramming of appropriated funds, and funds control for distributions, rescission management and enterprise reporting (e.g., production of the DD 1414, DD1415 and DD1416 reports).  <BR>Additionally, EFD will serve as a key enabler to t he implementation of the Standard Financial Information Structure (SFIS), consistently providing key funding data (e.g., Department Regular Code, Main Account Code, etc.) including the Organization Unique Identifier (OUID ).   EFD will leverage OUIDs to es tablish a financial management organization structure, here within referred to as the FM OUID Alias structure.   <BR>The EFD capabilities will be used by all organizations down to level 3 of the Financial Management OUID Alias structure and for all levels,  down to level 7 of the FM OUID Alias structure, for TI-97 appropriations.<BR>1.4	Instructions for Responding to the RFI Questionnaire (Part II)<BR>The RFI Questionnaire (Part 2) is divided into the following sections.<BR>Section 2.1 - requests information  about your organization. You MUST respond to this section.<BR>Section 2.2 - requests responses to enterprise-wide funds distribution responsibilities and reporting capabilities.  These capabilities are described further in section 3 of this RFI. (10 Pages  Limit)<BR>Section 2.3 - requests responses related to technical-based requirements. (10 Pages Limit)<BR>Section 2.4 - provides an opportunity to provide additi onal information beyond the questions found in Section 2.2 and 2.3 that you feel should be considered to meet the purpose of this RFI.  We are interested in both your actual experience and your recommendations about what would work best to achieve the goal s and objectives of an enterprise-wide funds distribution solution. <BR>The government recognizes that many potential respondents will only have information pertaining to a portion of the RFI. However, partial information may be of high quality and signifi cant value to the EFD initiative. Therefore, while the Department seeks a comprehensive approach, it does not discourage partial responses with the exception of the respondent information requested in Section 2.1. If you chose not to respond to a question,  indicate so with a no response.  <BR><BR> <BR>2.

<DESC>This Request For Information is intended to gather a technical proposal via a contractor generated Statement of Work. Proposals shall conform to the paramaters in the Statement of Objectives herewith. 

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVE FOR THE
Advanced Command Destruct System (ACDS)


1.0  Scope. 

Replace the existing command destruct system at Eglin AFB with a more reliable and supportable Advanced Command Destruct System (ACDS) capable of ensuring safe and secure operation of future as well as legacy weapon systems. 
  

2.0  Program Objectives.

The design, development, putting in place, and training on use of a new Advanced Command Destruction System (ACDS).  The effort shall include the incorporation of modernized Components,  use of recently developed Enhanced Flight Termination System (EFTS) components, and training on use of the new ACDS.  Finally, the ADCS shall be capable of interfacing with the existing command destruct equipment in order to retain legacy capability.  This objective is to be accomplished in 4 phases, each phase a year in duration.

Phase 1:    
	Signal and Control?.Replace current Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) communications links, located at CCF, A-3, D-3, and MFTTS) with T1 based serial data links.  These data links must contain redundant data paths and will take advantage of existing fiber optic and RF transmission paths.

Phase 2:  
	Range Safety/CCF?.The Range Safety Office (RSO) complex located at the Central Control Facility (CCF) will be replaced with new equipment capable of producing legacy tone based and new encoded/encrypted FTS commands.  These commands will be sent to the transmitter sites using the new Signal and Control equipment purchased in FY08.  New equipment is included for CCF to monitor and record the commands prior to leaving the facility.
	MFTTS Complex 1?.FTS transmitters and monitoring equipment to produce the high power FTS commands.  This equipment will be installed by EMI Technologies before the MFTTS is delivered to Eglin AFB.
	RICS Development Software?.Specialized software needs to be developed for the Eglin RICS system to record the legacy IRIG and new EFTS commands.  Additionally, new software needs to be developed to display the data graphically for the FTS operators and Range Safety.
	RICS Infrastructure?.All of the sites involved with this program have existing RICS infrastructure to allow data connection to the Eglin Range Instrumentation Grid (RIG), except D-3.  Ethernet equipment will be purchased and installed at D-3 to provide RIG connectivity.	

Phase 3
	Transmitter Complexes?.Each transmitter complex consists of redundant hardware necessary to transmit high powered RF FTS commands.  Each complex has an associated redundant monitoring capability that results in simultaneous computer collection and ethernet broadcast of the monitored data.
	Transmitter Spares?.The anticipated lifespan of the transmitter complexes is measured in decades so sufficient spares are required.  One spare for every two pieces of equipment are budgeted.
	FCA?.Each FCA facility performs the same monitoring function that the transmitters do, except the source is the free space RF signal.  Their monitoring system is identical to the transmitter sites, including redundancy.
	FCA Spares?.The anticipated lifespan of the FCA monitoring equipment must meet the same requirements as the transmitters and therefore must also have one spare for every two pieces of equipment.

Phase 4
	Transmitter Antennas?.Each FTS transmitter complex must have omni directional and directional antennas available for radiation.  The omni directional is used for most missions providing hemispherical coverage.  When the test item is at such a long range that the omni directional antenna cannot supply sufficient power, the directional is used.  The directional antenna focuses the RF radiation in a narrow beam so that the power level is greater, but with less spatial coverage.  Each directional antenna must be mounted on a pedestal that can position the antenna to any azimuth and elevation angle so the antenna can maintain pointing at the test item.
	FCA Antennas?.Each FCA monitoring complex must be connected to an omni directional antenna if monitoring the source of the FTS transmission (each is located within 3 miles of the transmitter).  If FCA is to monitor the FTS signal from the test item, a directional antenna with pedestal is required to make sure the antenna is pointed at the right location.
	.  Antenna Spares?.Although antennas typically do not fail, the potential for damage from hurricanes makes spare antennas necessary to quickly return to operational status.


3.0  Contract Objectives.

       a. Offerors to provide a technical proposal with a Statement of Work (SOW).
	b. SOW items shall be directly linked to the Program Objectives under section 2.0 
           above.
	c. Multi-year contract:  Offeror to propose a one year contract with 3
           one year options.
	d. Offeror's proposal, while satisfying the Program Objectives, will meet the
           financial constraints of the contract as defined by the government.  
e..Prior to receiving proposals, the government shall provide to all interested
parties (at different dates and / or times) a one time on-site visit.   


4.0  Management Objectives.

The primary management objective is twofold.

4.1  Allow the contractor maximum flexibility to innovatively manage program cost, schedule, performance, risks, warranties, contracts and subcontracts, vendors, and data required to deliver an effective and affordable ACDS.

4.2  Maintain clear Government insight into program cost, schedule, technical performance, and risk.

The purpose of this Notice is to identify potential sources that may be interested in and capable of performing the work described herein.  The NHTSA welcomes Corporate Capability Statements from all individuals and organizations.  The NHTSA does not intend to award a contract on the basis of responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or NHTSA's use of such information.  Acknowledgement of receipt of responses will not be made, nor will respondents be notified of NHTSA's evaluation of the information received.  As a result of this Notice, the NHTSA may issue a Request for Proposals (RFP).  However, should such a requirement fail to materialize, no basis for claims against the NHTSA shall arise as a result of a response to this Notice.  

More than one million motor vehicle thefts occur annually in the United States (U.S.), causing lost of mobility and economic impact to those affected.  In the U.S., two vehicles are stolen every minute and vehicle theft remains the nation's number one property crime, costing an estimated $7.6 billion each year.  Vehicle theft is also a global epidemic.  It is estimated that the global cost of motor vehicle theft is approximately $20.5 billion. 

The Congress enacted the Motor Vehicle Theft Law Enforcement Act in 1984 (the 1984 Theft Act) as a measure to reduce the growing problem of motor vehicle theft in the 1980's.  It added Title VI to the Motor Vehicle and Information Cost Savings Act (re-codified as Chapter 331 of Title 49, United States Code).  The purpose of the 1984 Theft Act was to help reduce motor vehicle thefts and to provide a tool for law enforcement to trace and recover stolen motor vehicles and vehicle parts while minimizing the cost increase to the consumer.

Under the provision of the 1984 Theft Act, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published the regulation entitled "Exemption from the Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard", 49 CFR Part 543.  The 1984 Theft Act intended to encourage manufacturers to use anti-theft devices which could act as a further theft deterrent.  49 CFR Part 543 allows a manufacturer to petition the agency for an exemption from the parts-marking requirements of the theft standard of a vehicle line when it plans to install an anti-theft device as standard equipment on the entire line.  The agency may approve the exemption if it determines that the anti-theft device is likely to be as effective as parts-marking in reducing and deterring motor vehicle theft. 

The following is a summary of major events in the theft prevention regulatory history:

On October 24, 1985, NHTSA published the Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, 49 CFR Part 541.  The purpose of this standard is to reduce motor vehicle theft by assisting law enforcement authorities trace and recover the parts from stolen vehicles.  

This standard became effective beginning with the 1987 model year and required that selected high theft car lines have 12 (two door models) or 14 (four door models) of its major component parts-marked with the V.I.N.  Each vehicle in a high theft line must have its major parts and major replacement parts-marked unless the vehicle line is granted an exemption from the parts marking requirements. 

As a result of an increase in motor vehicle thefts and associated crimes, the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 (the 1992 Theft Act), was created.  The 1992 Theft Act amended the Theft Prevention Standard by extending the Federal parts-marking requirements to include light-duty trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles (with a GVWR of 6,000 pounds or less).  On December 13, 1994, the final rule amending the Theft Prevention Standard was published.  This December 1994 rulemaking extended the parts-marking requirements:  (a) to include multipurpose passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks; (b) listed the major component parts and replacement parts to be marked for each of the classes of vehicles such as the engine, transmission, front/rear bumper, right/left front fender, hood, right/left front door, right/left rear door, sliding or cargo door(s), right/left quarter panel (passenger cars), right/left side assembly (MPVs), pickup box, and/or cargo box (light duty trucks), rear doors, decklid or hatchback and tailgate; and (c) established a new median theft rate (3.5826) for all passenger motor vehicles.  This amendment became effective beginning with MY 1997 vehicles.

On April 6, 2004, NHTSA published a Final Rule extending the anti-theft parts-marking requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard, CFR Part 541.  This regulation expands NHTSA?s current anti-theft parts marking requirement to include: (1) all below median theft rate passenger cars and multipurpose passenger vehicles (with a gross vehicle weight rating of 6,000 pounds or less), and (2) below median theft rate light-duty trucks with major parts that are interchangeable with passenger motor vehicles subject to parts-marking. This Final Rule was effective beginning September 1, 2006. 

On May 19, 2005, NHTSA published a Final Rule responding to petitions for reconsideration of the new rule extending the anti-theft parts-marking requirements.  This Final  Rule made the following changes and clarifications to the agency?s expanded parts-marking requirements:  (1) manufacturers are no longer required to submit likely theft rate determinations for vehicle lines introduced prior to the September 1, 2006, effective date, if the manufacturers choose to voluntarily mark the new vehicle lines immediately after their introduction; (2) manufacturers are permitted to petition the agency to exempt low-theft vehicle lines equipped with antitheft devices from the parts marking requirements beginning with model year 2006; (3) vehicle lines with annual production of not more than 3,500 vehicles are excluded from the parts-marking requirements; and (4) the agency adopted a phase-in of the new parts-marking requirements over a two-year period.

Based on a recent analysis report by NHTSA's Consumer Standards Division, although improvements have been made in motor vehicle theft prevention, vehicle theft remains a persistent problem in the U.S.  The analysis report concluded that there is still work to be done and more focused research is needed to effectively evaluate the downward trend in vehicle theft rates.  

The main objective of the project is to evaluate the contribution of parts-marking and anti-theft devices to vehicle theft prevention and the downward trend of vehicle theft rates, through research and analysis of each technology.  Research and analysis should be conducted on the available technologies, the effectiveness of each, relationship of auto-theft to public safety, and cost analysis.  The contractor should draw on many sources of information, such as vehicle manufacturers, parts-marking label and anti-theft device manufacturers, law enforcement, National Crime Information Center (NCIC), Department of Justice (DOJ), Highway Loss Data Institute (HLDI), insurance companies, public and any other sources.

Format of Corporate Capabilities Statement:

Any interested organizations should submit the Corporate Capability Statement which demonstrates the firm's ability and interest in no more than 10 pages to perform the key requirements described above.  All proprietary information should be marked as such. 

All respondents are asked to indicate the type and size of their business organization, e.g., Large business, Small Business, Small Disadvantaged Business, Women-Owned-Business, 8(A), Historically Black College or University/Minority Institution (HBCU/MI), educational institution, profit/non-profit organization, in their response. Interested offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Notice no later than 15 calendar days from date of posting. E-mail is the preferred method when receiving responses to this Notice.

<DESC>Description:

Sources Sought Notices (herein referred to as a Request for Information) are issued by Department of State (DoS) in performing market research to determine industry interest and capabilities. This is a Request for Information announcement only. This is not a solicitation or request for proposal and in no way commits the Government to award a contract.  The Government does not intend to award a contract(s) based solely on the submission of this Request for Information nor does it intend to pay for any costs incurred in response to this announcement.

The DoS reserves the right to terminate this request and change its requirements if needed. Responding to this notice does not guarantee participation in future Department activities. 

Background:

The Department is seeking sources capable of providing program engineering, production control and delivery to its Global Information Technology Modernization (GITM) Program under the General Services Administration (GSA) IT 70 Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), Government Wide Acquisition Contract (GWAC) or other. The DoS Bureau of Information Resources Management (IRM) Program Management and Analysis (PMA) Directorate has had a full history of modernizing technology.  Originally, the Directorate was tasked with implementing the - A Logistical Modernization Approach - (ALMA) Program, focusing its resources solely on refreshing and modernizing overseas unclassified technology.  The ALMA Program was followed by a similar effort domestically to encourage Department bureaus to modernize equipment and systems. As part of this effort, OpenNetPlus was initiated in 2001 to provide all unclassified users access to e-mail and the Internet.

In 2001, PMA initiated the Classified Connectivity Program (CCP), acting on the Departments desire to quickly replace the obsolete computer/communications equipment that posts were using to process classified foreign affairs information and to extend capabilities to posts that did not formerly have access to classified processing and classified e-mail.  This program was completed in Fiscal Year (FY) 2003 and extended both classified processing capabilities and e-mail to 221 posts.

In October 2003, ALMA and CCP were combined to establish the GITM Program.  The GITM Program provides strong customer focus and services closely aligned with the Departments E-Government (E-Gov) and E-Diplomacy guidance and vision to missions abroad and domestic bureaus/offices.  The GITM modernization of classified and unclassified systems protects the Departments substantial investment in IT infrastructure by keeping the Local Area Network (LAN) segment of the Department?s networks on a four (4) year refresh cycle.  GITMs program attributes include centralized management of the IT infrastructure under a single Program Management Office (PMO), facilitation and infrastructure changes required to support the Departments evolving reengineered business processes, and modernization of the IT infrastructure that results in an enhancement of the enterprises overall security.  These attributes promote increased operational efficiencies and cost avoidance across the Department, as well as a strengthened security posture for systems.

GITM intends to support the Presidents Management Agenda initiative of Expanded Electronic Government by employing common information technology that facilitates seamless information sharing across agencies.  GITM also supports the Departments efforts for IT Consolidation, and the Departments Strategic Architecture and Strategic Plan. Utilizing a four-year refresh cycle, each funded mission domestic and abroad is visited by GITM and receives modernized information technology equipment.  This lifecycle is successfully accomplished through the use of and adherence to well-defined processes and procedures.

PMA is an International Standards Organization (ISO) 9001 certified organization.

ManTech International Corporation, Fairfax, VA is the incumbent contractor.

<DESC>BACKGROUND: The Social Security Administration (SSA) is seeking vendors capable of providing a software product that would permit testing applications in the IBM WebSphere Versions 5.1 and 6.1 environment simulating different date scenarios using both a past and future system date.  Many programs have functions that are activated only under certain date conditions. Such programs cannot be fully tested without executing them during a current date condition that will trigger this logic.  SSA needs a simple mechanism to manipulate the date being used as the system date for chosen WebSphere applications being tested without impacting other applications.  This software product would allow application developers to test ?date-affected? applications-functionality using an initial date and then alter the perceived date to further test functionality.  MANDATORY EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS: The product must: 1)  run with IBM WebSphere Versions 5.1 and 6.1 in both Sun Solaris v8 or v10 and IBM z/OS v1.8 or z/OS v1.9 environments;  2) be capable of processing in an environment that could include Customer Information Control System (CICS), Database 2 (DB2), and Tivoli ITCAMS software; and, 3) provide telephone hotline support during normal business hours.      Responses must be specific as to the product proposed.   This is not a request for proposal and the Government does not intend to pay for information submitted.  The Government will not award a contract based on responses received; however, SSA will use this information to assess capable sources.  Detailed responses to each of the above requirements (with substantiating documentation) are required.  SSA will not consider simple marketing information or incomplete responses, nor will SSA consider reference to vendor web sites as a valid response.  Respondents should indicate whether their software is available on GSA Federal Supply Schedules or any other Government-wide Agency Contract (GWAC).  NOTE: Vendors must provide verifiable proof of Section 508 Compliancy in sufficient detail to demonstrate their ability to meet the Agency?s requirement, see URL site http://www.section508.gov/.  Vendors that are confident of offering a technically complaint product, which meets the above listed criteria, must submit information concerning their product?s capabilities.  Electronic responses must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on February 13, 2008.  SSA will not accept faxed information.  The size limitation for email attachments is 10 megabytes.  MS Word is the Agency?s standard word processing software. SSA will not provide acknowledgement of response received.  Respondents should refer to SSA-SSS-DateSimulation-CS.

Specifically, the <BR>contaminants that must be removed or treated are:<BR>1.	Cryptosporid ium <BR>2.	Giardia<BR>3.	Human enteric viruses<BR>4.	Coliform bacteria<BR>5.	Turbidity<BR>Removal or remediation of other EPA NDWS contaminants is desired but not <BR>required.  Other contaminants that are desired but not required to be removed or <BR>trea ted include organic chemicals, such as insecticides, herbicides, #6 fuel oil, <BR>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and inorganic chemicals, such as arsenic and <BR>lead.    <BR><BR>Respondents to this sources sought request shall submit: <BR>1. A physical description of their water purification system.<BR>2. Documented test data of their water purification systems performance in <BR>accordance with recognized water purification standards (i.e. NSF 53 or P248).<BR>3. The lifecycle purification capacity of t heir system (in liters).<BR>4. The purification rate of their system (in liters per hour).<BR>5. The shelf life of their system (in months).<BR>6. The packaging data of their system (units per pallet, cubic volume and weight <BR>of pallet).<BR>7. The curre nt Manufactured Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) and the wholesale <BR>cost of their item (in quantity).<BR><BR>The desired objective is for a system that does not require the user to add a <BR>chemical disinfectant.  However, any business concern that offers  a COTS system <BR>that currently meets most but not all the personal portable water purification <BR>system requirements is encouraged to submit a proposed product improvement <BR>plan for achieving all desired system performance requirements.  For instan ce, if <BR>their current filter system requires the addition of a chemical disinfectant to <BR>remediate viruses, they can submit their current COTS product and a proposed <BR>product improvement plan that would eliminate the need to add a chemical <BR>dis infectant to remediate viruses.<BR><BR>The Government will not reimburse any business concern for any information <BR>submitted in response to this sources sought request.

<DESC><BR>SCOPE OF WORK  CY2008<BR><BR>1.  Project Title:  Post Release Performance of Natural and Hatchery Clearwater River Fall Chinook Salmon<BR><BR>2.  Appropriation:  Operation and Maintenance (O&M), Fish and Wildlife Program.<BR><BR>3.  Purpose an d Scope:  The proposed research activities are to evaluate post release performance of natural and hatchery Clearwater River fall Chinook salmon.  The 2004 NOAA Fisheries Biological Opinion calls for an evaluation of the effectiveness of transportation for  improving survival of the ESA listed natural Snake River fall Chinook salmon.  The Updated Proposed Actions for the FCRPS indicates that a comprehensive evaluation of fall Chinook transportation is planned to begin in 2007/2008.  There are numerous comple x issues surrounding Snake River fall Chinook salmon and the development of an overall transportation study.  The Walla Walla District needs additional marking of natural Clearwater River fall Chinook salmon to compare the performance of hatchery fish as s ubstitutes for natural fish.  This information will help determine if hatchery fish can be used in transportation and other migration behavior and life history studies.  This research supports the Operation of the Federal Power System in the 2000 National Marine Fisheries Service Biological Opinion under the Endangered Species Act, Section 7 Consultation, Actions items 42, 46, 47, 48, 51, and 185. The work will be done in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service, Idaho Fishery Resource Office, who wil l rear surrogate fish at the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery to natural size and release them into the Clearwater River in 2008.  <BR><BR>This research requires specialized coordination from the Fish and Wildlife Service (Idaho Fishery Resource Office), th e Nez Perce Tribe, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, Idaho Department of Fish and Game, the Umatilla Tribe, and the Columbia River Inter-tribal Fish Commission as outlined in the 2008 Consensus Research Pro posal, Evaluating the Responses of Snake and Columbia River Basin fall Chinook Salmon to Dam Passage Strategies and Experiences.  Fieldwork to supplement sampling and PIT tagging of natural Clearwater River fall Chinook salmon must begin by early-May 2008  to sample the peak outmigration period (approximately May-June) on the Clearwater River. The Nez Perce Tribe has sampled, PIT tagged, and collected natural Clearwater River fall Chinook salmon life history data since 1991.  Information is required to dete rmine if hatchery fish can be raised to perform as natural surrogates in the Clearwater River.  <BR><BR>4.	Nez Perce Tribe Obligation: <BR><BR>a.	The Nez Perce Tribe will conduct the following research objectives.<BR><BR>All work described within the propo sal covers the 2008 calendar year, with the exception of draft and final reports.  <BR><BR>Objective 2	Compare the post-release performance of natural fall Chinook salmon subyearlings from the Snake and Clearwater rivers to hatchery fall Chinook salmon sub yearlings released in these rivers as natural fish surrogates for transportation studies.  <BR><BR>Task 2.1	Culture, tag, and release surrogate group:  Coordinate and assist as needed the Fish and Wildlife Service, Idaho Fishery Resource Office in PIT tagg ing and release of up to 130,000 surrogate experimental release group into the Clearwater River.<BR><BR>Task 2.2	Scheduling surrogate tagging and release:  Use historical data collected during the 2001  2007 field seasons by the Nez Perce Tribe and 2007/0 8 Clearwater River incubating water temperatures to develop a regression model for predicting the median date 70-75 mm natural fall Chinook are present along the Clearwater River shorelines.  Trap natural fall Chinook during 2008 in the lower Clearwater Ri ver and provide empirical data to model and plan the best release timing of hatchery surrogates to match the median date of presence of natural fish.<BR><BR>Tas k 2.3	PIT Tag natural fall Chinook in the Clearwater River:  Conduct supplemental sampling to increase the number of natural fall Chinook salmon presently collected and implanted with PIT tags in the Clearwater River as part of the on-going Bonneville Powe r Administration funded study.  The goal is to increase the number of natural fish tagged by up to 8,000 in the Clearwater River.  Conduct a pilot study in 2008 to PIT tag up to 10,000 natural fish that are 40-60mm in length using the smaller 8.5mm PIT tag .  A random sub sample of 100 wild fish captured during the supplemental sampling in the Clearwater River will be caudal fin clipped to determine genetic lineage.<BR><BR>Task 2.4	Assigning treatment groups:  Treatment groups will be coordinated with Nation al Marine Fisheries Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nez Perce Tribe.  Treatment groups will be developed from historical data modeling, median fish presence, and sampling efficiency.<BR><BR>b.	Field Schedule:  The Nez Perce Tribe will assist the  Fish and Wildlife Service, IFRO in rearing Lyons Ferry Hatchery fall Chinook salmon at the Dworshak National Fish Hatchery beginning February 2008.  Sampling and PIT tagging natural Snake River and Clearwater River fall Chinook salmon will occur May - Jul y 2008.  The Nez Perce Tribe will provide a monthly schedule of field activities to Mr. Scott Dunmire (509) 527-7238.<BR><BR>Events may occur which change the projected test design.  Any changes to the proposed Scope of Work must be coordinated through the  District AFEP Coordinator, Mr. Marvin Shutters (509-527-7249), who will coordinate the changes through the appropriate chain of command within the Corps, including consultation with other involved groups as necessary.

<DESC>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The Northwest Region (TRBO Region 11), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 8 Army, Navy, Air Force Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in Washington and Alaska announces a Request for Regional Incenti ve Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Exam Paper <BR><BR>The primary objective of this program is to standardize products or product lines obtaining the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price based on volu me pricing discounts utilizing a best value determination process. Standardized products will be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. <BR><BR>The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing S tock Keeping Units (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requi rements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.<BR><BR>The Military Treatment Facilities (MTF)  in the Northwest Region include but are not limited to: Basset Army Community Hospital, Fort Wainwright, AK 99703; Bremerton Naval Hospital, Bremerton, WA 98312-5000; Fairchild AFB Clinic,Fairchild AFB, WA 99011-8701; 354th Medical Group, Eielson Air Forc e Base, AK 99702;3rd Medical Group, Elmendorf AFB, AK 99506-3620; Madigan Army Medical Center, Tacoma, WA 98431-5000; McChord AFB Clinic, McChord AFB, WA 98438-1150; Oak Harbor Naval Hospital, Oak Harbor, WA 98278-8800<BR><BR>This Regional Incentive Agreem ent announcement is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have, or be in process of obtaining, a Distribution and P ricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor (Cardinal Health).  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR>The agreement will be for a base period of two (2)  years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is April 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical, and pricing factors.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off  criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a  combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR><BR>Point of Contact:<BR>Pat Cordier, RN, MSN, CNOR at (253) 968-0898; Email - patricia.cordier@us.army.mil<BR><BR>B.	Products & Performance Required.  <BR><BR>The Northwest Region is seeking Ex am Paper. The product line consists primarily of exam table paper barriers and includes crepe, perforated, and smooth paper in standard widths 14 to 21 inches and with roll lengths from 120 to 250 feet.  <BR> <BR>The Regions estimated annual demand for thi s product line, based on PV purchases for the previous 12 months is: Northwest Region: - Total	$58,323<BR><BR><BR>The top high volume usage lines for this project include: <BR><BR>PAPER TABLE CREPE 18IN X 125FT WHITE<BR>EXAM  TABLE PAPER 18X125 WHITE<BR>PA PER PERFORATED 18INCH X 125 FT  WHITE<BR>PAPER CREPE 14.5INCH X 125FT PEDIATRIC<BR>PAPER TABLE 18IN CREPE<BR>PAPER CREPE 14.5 INCH X 125 FEET BEAR<BR>PAPER TABL E 18IN CREPE<BR>PAPER CREPE 14.5 INCH X 125 FEET WHITE<BR>PAPER SMOOTH TABLE 18 INCH X 225 FEET<BR>PAPER CREPE 21 INCH X 125 FEET BEAR<BR><BR>Upon request, vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, pricing information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.<BR><BR>C.	Instructions to Vendors.  <BR><BR>This process will  include vendor requirements to provide electronic responses (all email communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed) to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes . DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to patricia.cordier@us.army.mil Submissions must be received by 4 :00 PM EST on 10 March, 2008 the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating.  <BR><BR>Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRB O) via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR>	<BR>D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Rev iew Board (TPRB) is the governing board for the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.  The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best respon ses to all technical and/or company criteria listed in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendors best tiered-pricing discounts off the vendors DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the N orthwest Region. Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Regions may limit the number of quotes to th e greatest number that will permit efficient competition among vendors. 14 calendar days from the date of the pricing request will be allowed for responses in the requested format.<BR><BR>Phase I Technical/Company Evaluation Process: <BR><BR>1.  The source s sought notice will be posted to the FBO for a period of five weeks. Vendors that do not meet the deadline of Close of Business (COB) 4:00PM PST listed on the FBO for responding to the announcement will be disqualified from further consideration. Due to t he potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that its response and literature actually arrived at the Region via email. We strongly recommend that each vendo r confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission. All email communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed. <BR><BR><BR>2.  At the 3 week mark if re sponse has been less than anticipated, all vendors with current usage for the product line in the region will be contacted via email. If industry participation is unsatisfactory; the TPRB will decide to proceed, delay, or cancel the project. All email communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed. (2 week notice)<BR><BR>3.  Vendors respond to the FBO announcement by e-mail stating their i nterest in participating in the standardization process, addressing the technical/company criteria, and providing product literature to the POC listed on the announcement. All email communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed. <B R><BR>4.  Vendor replies should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company requirements listed in this announcement. <BR><BR>5.  The TRBO team will compile the technical/company criteria responses and send to the CPT for review.<BR ><BR>6.	The CPT will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and which vendors are disqualified based on their responses to the technical/company criteria. Generally, responses demonstrate that: 1) the vendor off ering the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of Exam Paper; 2) based on the vendors responses, the Region has reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services offered meet the medical standards of care of the communit y, applicable to such products or services; 3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items; 4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region; 5) the vendor offers discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative and 6) the vendors information provided is factually correct (any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.)<BR>7.	The vendors who meet the  technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process(all email communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed).<BR><BR><BR>Technical/Company Criteria:  During the pre-source selec tion procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted criteria:      <BR><BR>1.  Vendor is required to provide a full range of exam table paper products.  Please list the products (including the dimensions ie 18 inches x 125 feet) tha t your company provides.  Please note that additional requirements may become required items of supply in the future.  Overall a complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined  in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  <BR><BR>2.  Vendors that do not meet the following criteria will be disqualified:<BR>    a.  Vendor must have  a DAPA for this product group (please provide DAPA number).  <BR>    b.  Vendor must have a distribution agreement with Cardinal Health, the regions prime vendor.  Please acknowledge and identify that you have such an agreement with Cardinal Health.<BR>    c.  Vendor must offer committed volume discounts off their DAPA price for this product group. (Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA     holders are required to submit the FSS price as their DAPA price. FSS prices are not a discount off the DAPA pr ice.)<BR>   <BR>3.  The Vendor has a delivery network that allows products to reach the Prime Vendor Distribution Center in sufficient quantities to meet regional demand history in a timely manner.  Vendor representation must be sufficient to provide produ ct implementation services and customer servicing to all eight facilities in the region.  Please answer Yes/ No and provide contact information (name, address, phone, email) for your representative(s). <BR><BR>4.  Please provide a copy of your companys re turned goods policy.<BR><BR>5.  Please provide any history of backorders, recalls, and/or adverse events for this product line stating dates and duration, cause , and resolution. Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents.  If your company has not had any of the above, so state.<BR><BR><BR>Phase II Clinical/ Performance Evaluation Process:<BR><BR>1.  Using their clinical expertise, the CPT will develop a list of items from the product group to evaluate. The determination of the sample set is based on advances in technology and/ or patient safety, and on historical usage for the product line.<BR><BR>2.  The TRBO office will request a no charge clinical evaluation sample set from each of the vendors with a requ ired delivery date. All email communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed. Each vendor will send the samples directly to the participating MTFs. Vendors who do not meet the deadline for sample arrival will be disqualified from th e standardization process. Due to the potential for samples to become lost, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that their samples arrived at the Region. We strongly recommend that vendors confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the deadline, if a problem should occur with the first delivery. <BR><BR>3.  The CPT will evaluate each product against the clinical/performance criteria. The evaluation will take place in a non-patient care setting, by the clinici ans in the CPT.  The evaluation responses will represent a clinical value judgment placed in a Likert-like scale with a 1 to 5 scoring format (1 = Strongly Disagree; 2 = Disagree or 'no'; 3 = Undecided; 4 = Agree or 'yes'; 5 = Strongly Agree).  Comments wi ll be invited and recorded on the evaluations.<BR><BR>4.  If clinicians determine that more information is needed about how the product works in a patient-care environment, then the vendors who scored highest on the non-patient care evaluation will be eval uated in a patient care setting.  The Government will include the greatest number of vendors that will permit efficient competition without disrupting ongoing patient care. The same clinical/performance criteria and evaluation method will be used in the pa tient-care setting evaluation.<BR><BR>5.  The CPT has set a clinical acceptability threshold target at 3.1 The CPT will analyze this acceptability as being at or near 3.1 depending on the 'break' in the average scores and how closely scores are clustered n ear the clinical acceptability target threshold of 3.1.  Below this threshold, products will be clinically unacceptable and will be disqualified from further consideration for standardization. <BR><BR>6.  Clinical evaluations will be tabulated by the TRBO and results will be forwarded to the CPT members for review. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR><BR>Clinical/Performance Criteria: During the pre-source selection procedures, the CPT validated/ approved the following equally weighted criteria:      <BR><BR>1.  Product withstands the patients weight without tearing (maintains the hygienic barrier between the exam surface and patient).<BR><BR>2.  Product withstands fluids withou t tearing (maintains the hygienic barrier between the exam surface and patient; does not leak emesis, diarrhea, medications, irrigations, or dressing change solutions). <BR><BR>3.  Product is not abrasive to the skin (enhancing patient comfort during proce dures).<BR><BR>4.  Product unrolls easily (roll moves smoothly in the cradle and the edges do not fray upon dispensing enhancing staff efficiency). <BR><BR>5.  The used portion of the product can be detached quickly from the roll (paper does not bunch up o r shred when removing the used portion enhancing staff efficiency). <BR><BR>Phase III Pricing Analysis: <BR><BR>1.  The following elements will be considered in  the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization/ Conversion Costs), (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (3) Consideration of SKUs (i.e. potential for inventory reduction) by each vendor.  The impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.   <BR><BR>2.  Vendors who meet the clinical acceptability threshold considering the break will be asked to submit pricing for analysis. All email communications between vendors and the regi on will be digitally signed. 14 calendar days from the date of the request will be allowed for responses in the requested format. Vendors that do not meet the deadline and those vendors that fail to respond as required will be disqualified from considerati on. Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the TRBO that its response actually arrived at the Region via email. We strongly recommend that each vendor c onfirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the evaluation process.<BR><BR>3.  The T RBO will conduct a price analysis. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement .  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct disc ussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary.  If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors wi thout disrupting ongoing patient care.<BR><BR>4.  The price analysis will be sent to the Northwest Region TPRB for review. Pricing will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible (3) three one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 ye ars).<BR><BR>5.  Technical/ Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical results become more equal, price becomes more important. The TPRB reviews the data for acceptable performance and price analysis.<BR><BR>6.  The Designated Senior Logistician (DSL) will ensure that the offered prices in conjunction with the volume purchasing commitment will be a good value considering the costs associate d with standardization, operational impact, and regional clinical preferences.<BR><BR>7.  The TPRB selects a vendor for standardization.<BR><BR>

<SUBJECT>99 -- Proposed addition of Urinal Deodorant Cakes to the Procurement List of the Committee for Purchase from People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.  It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of Urinal Deodorant Cakes by the Federal Government. 
 
The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the total Government requirement for the following product to the P/L:

Urinal Deodorant Cake, Non-Para 
6840-00-246-6438

The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Southwest Supply Center, Fort Worth, TX.
  
Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Urinal Deodorant Cakes to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are:

BIG 670 ? Evergreen w/Enzymes, Toss Block, Non-Para
BIG 680 ? Evergreen, Toss Block, Non-Para	
BIG 683 ? Apple, Toss Block, Non-Para
BIG 684 ? Cinnamon, Toss Block, Non-Para
BIG 685 ? Clean Breeze, Toss Block, Non-Para
FRS 20-TOSS-ST ? Toss Block, Non-Para
04901 ? Cherry, Toss In Block, Non-Para
BIG 900 ? Cherry, Toss Block, Para, 4 oz.
BIG 903 - Cherry, Toss Block, Para, 3 oz.
KRSU03BX ? Toss Block, Para, 3 oz.
KRSU03CT ? Toss Block, Para, 3 oz.
KRSU04BX ? Toss Block, Para, 4 oz.
KRSU04CT ? Toss Block, Para, 4 oz.
FRS-12-3-CH ? Toss Block, Para, 3 oz.
FRS-12-4-CH ? Toss Block, Para, 4 oz.


In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing Urinal Deodorant Cakes GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than February 20, 2008 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<SUBJECT>R -- Enhancements and Upgrades to the Comparative Emissions Database for Holistic Analysis of Modes of Transportation
<DESC>It is anticipated that this will be a SOLE-SOURCE procurement resulting in a new SOLE-SOURCE fixed-price contract.  Under this procurement, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) plans to award one and only one contract (which will probably be numbered as DTOS59-08-C-00411), to Aerodyne Research, Inc., on a SOLE-SOURCE basis.  It is anticipated that the SOLE-SOURCE award to Aerodyne will be in the form of a fixed-price contract, with an estimated value of $134,000 and a one-year period of performance.  Under the SOLE-SOURCE contract numbered DTOS59-08-C-00411 to be awarded to Aerodyne from this procurement, Aerodyne will produce ?Enhancements and Upgrades to the Comparative Emissions Database for Holistic Analysis of Modes of Transportation?.  Aerodyne had initially developed that database for DOT under Aerodyne?s PREVIOUS contract numbered DTOS59-05-C-00421, entitled ?Holistic Comparative Analysis of Emissions from Aviation, Automobile, Marine, and Diesel Transports?.  Aerodyne won that previous contract on a competitive basis, and under it Aerodyne constructed a database tool which incorporated data from Aerodyne, literature and certification sources, and which enabled comparison of the potential environmental impacts (especially for climate change) of moving passengers and freight via various transportation modes.  The Comparative Emissions Database (CEDB), compiled from Aerodyne?s previous contract numbered DTOS59-05-C-00421, assimilates the data necessary to calculate emission intensities (units of g/passenger-km or g/tonne-km), which can be useful for evaluating the impacts of potential policies for transportation emissions reduction.  Currently, the CEDB is a MySQL relational database, and queries to the database are performed by typing Structure Query Language (SQL) commands.  While that approach provides a flexible and powerful interface for the expert user, it proves to be somewhat of a barrier for the occasional user.  The goal of the second phase (i.e, the goal of the work to be performed under the new sole-source contract numbered DTOS59-08-C-00411 to be awarded from this procurement) would be to make the CEDB more accessible to the end-user at DOT, more accessible to the end-user at DOT?s modal administrations, and more accessible to end-users elsewhere.  Under the new sole-source contract numbered DTOS59-08-C-00411 to be awarded to Aerodyne from this procurement, Aerodyne will further develop the database tool that was created and populated with emissions data in Aerodyne?s previous contract numbered DTOS59-05-C-00421, and Aerodyne will enhance the database tool by developing a graphical user interface for the CEDB to make it more accessible for a wider range of potential users.  In addition and in parallel, Aerodyne will extend the CEDB to include additional data that has been identified or more recently been reported, which is currently not included in the CEDB.  By virtue of the precursor work which Aerodyne successfully performed under Contract No. DTOS59-05-C-00421, Aerodyne is the only known entity that has the necessary scientific and information technology intellectual capital, along with the ready access to additional academic expertise, to successfully address DOT?s needs in this new procurement (Contract No. DTOS59-08-C-00411) by rendering the highly specialized services that will be essential to performing the continued development of the CEDB at the very high level of quality required by DOT.  If, despite the existence of the above-mentioned factual basis logically identifying Aerodyne as the only organization capable of satisfactorily performing the new contract numbered DTOS59-08-C-00411 envisioned herein, any organization OTHER THAN Aerodyne believes that it can perform this new project at the very high level of quality required by DOT, then any such other organization shall E-MAIL a complete Statement of Qualifications to james.mowery@dot.gov and to William.chernicoff@dot.gov, and to aimee.fisher@dot.gov, not later than 4:15 PM Eastern Standard Time, February 13, 2008.    Faxed and telephonically transmitted Statements of Qualifications will NOT be accepted.

<SUBJECT>--Notice To Award A Sole Source Procurement
<DESC>Under the authority of  FAR 6.302-2, it is the intent of the Government to award a sole source interim contract to Valdez International Corporation for Transportation Motor Pool Operations services.  This interim contract award serves to extend the p eriod of performance for the existing Transportation Motor Pool Operations contract at Fort Carson, CO; for a period of three (3) months, from 1 Feb 2008 through 30 Apr 2008, while a long-term follow-on contract is awarded.  Due to the unusual and compelli ng urgency to extend the period of performance, it has been determined that use of another contractor during this short, interim period would likely incur excessive costs, and not allow for an adequate phase-in period needed for providing a continuous acce ptable level of performance.  This is not a formal solicitation. This synopsis is not considered a Request for Quotation or Proposal. No solicitation document is available and no contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice. The determination by the Government not to compete the requirement described herein is solely within the discretion of the Government, and contract award to Valdez International Corporation will be made without further notice.  Any response or inqu iry to this notice must be made in writing.  No telephone calls regarding this notice will be accepted.

Statement of Work:


1.0  Scope and Purpose

1.1  The FDA Biosciences Library requires unlimited online web access, via IP via Password, to the  current official USP-National Formulary (NF) Online and Pharmacopeial Forum (PF) Online. The online platform must allow quick searches with  24/7 access for Agency staff reducing the need for multiple individual print copies.   

2.0	Specific Requirements

2.1  The FDA requires online access to a product that shall provide, via one interface and one search platform access to the following titles:

	USP-NF provides access to official standards enforceable by FDA for drugs, and related products manufactured and marketed in the U. It also serves as a clear guide for the specifications, tests, procedures, and acceptance criteria required for pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality control. We require unlimited access via password.
	USP-PF provides access to the latest official standards, 2-12 months advance notice of changes in order to prepare for any upcoming requirements and to learn about changes before they are published in the NF. Suggestions and comments are also an option to influence new standards. 

2.2 	For the above list, the contractor shall provide the following:

a.  A site license for 24/7 desktop web access, via IP, for the Agency
b.  Customer service shall be available to troubleshoot website/connectivity issues via phone, email, etc.
c.  Researchers and librarians need access to all of the resources and must be able to search selected resources with one query and one interface.
d.  Customers require a single access interface to search across multiple resources.  This type of simultaneous searching reduces the need for multiple searches and saves the agency researcher?s research time and the cost of purchasing multiple print subscriptions through various contractors. 
 e.  Customers also require the ability to display related articles, i.e. to pull up other articles related to their area of research when they retrieve their original search results.

            
3.0  Description of Work

3.1  
Ideally, the FDA Biosciences Library prefers to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms.  This method provides a more efficient, time and cost savings manner for FDA researchers by saving of overall search time necessary for finding necessary information and performing the research work necessary to meet the mission of FDA.  

The contractor is expected to troubleshoot access as needed, but it will not be necessary to respond during non-operational hours as defined above.

	
3.2  Deliverables:

3.2.1 Ideally the FDA Biosciences Library prefers to search across one platform rather than multiple platforms in order to meet the needs of FDA researchers and save the Agency researchers search time in order for researchers to perform the work in a timely manner to meet the mission of FDA. 

If a plug-in, additional software or recommended software is required for optimal use, please include specific requirements. Contractor will address any questions or problems encountered when using this product with supported software or hardware.
The contractor shall provide usage statistics on a monthly basis.  The format of the usage statistics is provided either via email or contractor provided login and should include session count, search count and total document retrievals per title.

Contractor shall provide online tutorials.  Contractor shall also provide on-site training, briefings and updates to FDA researchers, in the DC area as well as selected remote offices.

4.  Period of Performance
Contract will commence on the date the contractor receives notification of award from the Office of Acquisitions and Grants. It will run for 12 months post date of award notification.  

5.  Payment
	Payment will be made only after satisfactory completion of concrete deliverables/service (i.e. access is available agency-wide via a static URL - IP access). 
Payment will be made in installments. The first will be made once access has been established for the first 3 months and other payments will include the remaining subscription. Pursuant to FAR 52.232-18, Availablity of Funds, funding is only available for the initial payment. 
Payment for the deliverables/services will occur only after and in the following order:
a.  a purchase order has been generated by the FDA contracting office.  The contractor shall NOT provide service to the FDA until a purchase order has been received.  This is considered an illegal procurement by the government.
b.  the FDA is being provided access to the resource 

5.  Deliverables

5.1 	Products to be delivered via email or mail
5.2	Static URL, password information (if necessary), product training, technical support numbers, account number, promotional materials, monthly usage statistics


6.  Place of Delivery or Performance
 
6.1  The products provided shall be hosted by the contractor server, but will be available via the Library?s intranet page, agency-wide.


7.0  Section 508

The contractor shall provide paperwork, called a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT), regarding the 508 Compliance status of the product(s) at the same time the bid is offered. For more information about 508 Compliance, please visit the following site:
http://508.hhs.gov/vendors.htm

The below links will provide overview and assistance to what is needed. A service still must be 508 compliant. 

The purpose of this part is to implement section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended (29 U.S.C. 794d). Section 508 requires that when Federal agencies develop, procure, maintain, or use electronic and information technology, Federal employees with disabilities have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access and use by Federal employees who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. Section 508 also requires that individuals with disabilities, who are members of the public seeking information or services from a Federal agency, have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to that provided to the public who are not individuals with disabilities, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the agency. 

So if federal employees or the public will use EIT that we procure, or develop, then it has to be accessible.  Technical standards that apply to web-based resources are provided below:

Subpart B -- Technical Standards
? 1194.22 Web-based intranet and internet information and applications.
(a) A text equivalent for every non-text element shall be provided (e.g., via "alt", "longdesc", or in element content). 
(b) Equivalent alternatives for any multimedia presentation shall be synchronized with the presentation. 
(c) Web pages shall be designed so that all information conveyed with color is also available without color, for example from context or markup. 
(d) Documents shall be organized so they are readable without requiring an associated style sheet. 
(e) Redundant text links shall be provided for each active region of a server-side image map. 
(f) Client-side image maps shall be provided instead of server-side image maps except where the regions cannot be defined with an available geometric shape. 
(g) Row and column headers shall be identified for data tables. 
(h) Markup shall be used to associate data cells and header cells for data tables that have two or more logical levels of row or column headers. 
(i) Frames shall be titled with text that facilitates frame identification and navigation. 
(j) Pages shall be designed to avoid causing the screen to flicker with a frequency greater than 2 Hz and lower than 55 Hz. 
(k) A text-only page, with equivalent information or functionality, shall be provided to make a web site comply with the provisions of this part, when compliance cannot be accomplished in any other way. The content of the text-only page shall be updated whenever the primary page changes. 
(l) When pages utilize scripting languages to display content, or to create interface elements, the information provided by the script shall be identified with functional text that can be read by assistive technology. 
(m) When a web page requires that an applet, plug-in or other application be present on the client system to interpret page content, the page must provide a link to a plug-in or applet that complies with ?1194.21(a) through (l). 
(n) When electronic forms are designed to be completed on-line, the form shall allow people using assistive technology to access the information, field elements, and functionality required for completion and submission of the form, including all directions and cues. 
(o) A method shall be provided that permits users to skip repetitive navigation links. 
(p) When a timed response is required, the user shall be alerted and given sufficient time to indicate more time is required. 
Note to ?1194.22:
1. The Board interprets paragraphs (a) through (k) of this section as consistent with the following priority 1 Checkpoints of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 (WCAG 1.0) (May 5, 1999) published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium: 

Section 1194.22 Paragraph	WCAG 1.0 Checkpoint
(a)	1.1
(b)	1.4
(c)	2.1
(d)	6.1
(e)	1.2
(f)	9.1
(g)	5.1
(h)	5.2
(i)	12.1
(j)	7.1
(k)	11.4


2. Paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section are different from WCAG 1.0. Web pages that conform to WCAG 1.0, level A (i.e., all priority 1 checkpoints) must also meet paragraphs (l), (m), (n), (o), and (p) of this section to comply with this section. WCAG 1.0 is available at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505. 
Subpart D -- Information, Documentation, and Support
? 1194.41 Information, documentation, and support.
(a) Product support documentation provided to end-users shall be made available in alternate formats upon request, at no additional charge. 
(b) End-users shall have access to a description of the accessibility and compatibility features of products in alternate formats or alternate methods upon request, at no additional charge. 
(c) Support services for products shall accommodate the communication needs of end-users with disabilities.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).
Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 
Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington, D. C. 20593, Telephone (202) 267-2285, Fax: (202) 267-4011. Potential sources having the expertise and required capabilities are invited to submit quotations that will be considered by the agency.  Quotations should be written and submitted in a legible format.  Submitted quotes shall have the contractor?s Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.

2.QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
Question 1. Section C.2.1.2 (Program Objectives) - This section notes that "The objectives of this effort are to augment the Government's expertise in earned value, schedule and cost estimating".  Does this imply that at least one contractor is already supporting a part of the SECTS effort?  If so, who are the contractors presently supporting this effort?  Also, what percentage of the total effort (total workload**) is being supported by the incumbent contractors?
Note - Depending on the size of the SECTS augmentation effort planned by the Government, ICS, Inc. might have to consider teaming alternatives.
 
**Section C.2.1.2 (Scope) defines the Total Effort / Workload = 60% NPOESS + 40% GOES-R

Answer: One contractor is currently augmenting the government?s expertise in earned value, scheduling and cost estimating support for both NPOESS and GOES-R.  Tecolote Research, Inc is the contractor currently providing this support.  The CSETS contract will continue this support after the existing contract with Tecolote Research, Inc ends this Spring.  Under the new requirements, 100% of the earned value and cost estimating is being performed for the GOES-R program; 50% of the GOES-R Programs scheduling will be performed on this contract. Currently, 90% of the earned value and 100% of the cost estimating and schedule is being performed for the NPOESS program.
 
Question 2. Considering that the RFP requires an offeror to cost this (augmentation?) efforts for the Base and four Option Years for providing the SECTS support to the IPO-NPOESS and the GOES-R Programs, how much "augmentation" effort (what share of the each program's percentage effort?)  should an offeror consider for estimating the cost for each program?  What are the extents (metrics) of the augmentation and/or of the total efforts in terms of the total number of systems, subsystems, tasks, schedules and/or the number of WBSs to be considered for costing each of the two programs?  

Answer: For the GOES-R program, 100% of the earned value and cost estimating and 50% of the Programs scheduling will be performed on this contract. 90% of the earned value and 100% of the cost estimating and schedule is being performed for the NPOESS program.  GOES-R will have 7 contracts that fall under EV, cost and schedule support requirements. Two prime contracts, one for the Spacecraft and one for the Ground System, and five separate instrument contracts that will be provided to the Spacecraft vendor for integration as Government Furnished Equipment. NPOESS will have 5 contracts that fall under EV, cost and schedule support requirements. One prime A&O contract and four (3 instrument & 1 ground) separate subcontracts that will be provided to the prime vendor for integration. Only the prime on NPOESS requires cost estimating support.

Question 3. Could the Government provide/suggest the formal/suitable website links that an offeror can use to study and assess the SECTS related efforts for costing the two programs noted in the RFP?

Answer: Two web sites that may be useful to understand the technical and programmatic content for the two programs are http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/ and http://npoess.noaa.gov/.  
 
Question 4. Or, should an offer do its own research of the NOAA and NASA websites related to the two programs for assessing the total and augmentation efforts required for costing purposes?  What other alternate guidance can the Government provide for assessing the SECTS efforts for costing the two programs?
 
Answer: The two websites listed above provide multiple starting points to find a large amount of data for both programs.  Additionally, these two programs are not classified and therefore a large amount of information is available through standard web queries.  

Question 5. Section C.2.3.4 (Scheduling) - This section requires a contractor to "have a thorough understanding of all the major schedule software products and tools.  What "major schedule software products and tools" are currently being used by the Government on the IPO-NPOESS and GOES-R programs?
 
Answer:  The GOES-R program currently uses Microsoft Project? and Milestones Professional? software products for schedule support. The NPOESS program currently uses Microsoft Project? and @Risk software products for schedule support.

Question 6, Also, in line with Questions # 5, What "major Earned value and Cost Estimating software products and tools" are currently being used by the Government on the IPO-NPOESS and GOES-R programs?
 
Answer:  NPOESS and GOES-R programs currently use wInsight for earned value support.

Question 7.  As noted in Section L.10, paragraph a, it notes that each proposal volume shall begin with an Executive summary, not to exceed two pages.  As stated under Section L.10, paragraph b, (1), Volume I (Business Proposal) ? it notes the inclusion of an Executive summary and in the Section L.10, ?Proposal Organization Table? it notes for Volume II (Technical Proposal) an Executive Summary is required but there is no other reference of the requirement for an Executive Summary in Volume III ? Cost / Price.  Is there are requirement for a Cost / Price Executive summary?

Answer:  Yes.  The ?PROPOSAL ORGANIZATION? Table in L.10 shall be amended to reflect the 2 page Executive Summary.

Question 8.  Given that this is a Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee Contract, will the Government provide the anticipated level of effort by labor category?

Answer: No, the Government requests the offeror to provide their estimate of anticipated level of effort required to support the acquisition the size of NPOESS and GOES-R.

Question 9.  Section L.15 (Number of Award (s) ) -   Will there be a transition period allowed for the awardee to prepare (its resources) before the start of the contract work?  If so, how long will it be?

Answer: As both NPOESS and GOES-R are on-going programs, cost, EV and schedule support must be maintained continuously; it is expected that selected contractor be prepared to provide full support at the initiation of the contract.

Question 10.  Under the requirements for the Business Volume submission under Section L.10.1 paragraph c  ?Acknowledgement of Receipt of Amendments?, are Contractors to provide signed copies of the amendments within this volume and will all amendments that are to be included and signed within Volume I ? Business Proposal be electronically posted on Federal Business Opportunities?  

Answer:  Yes.  Amendments must be signed and in the Business Proposal Volume as required by the solicitation.  Because of an issue with electronic attachments concerning this solicitation, SF-30s cannot be posted but will be provided upon request via e-mail.

Question 11.  Under the requirements of Section H.5, paragraph d, as stated ?When aircraft are used in connection with performing the contract ?? does the requirement apply when commercial or chartered aircraft are utilized in employee travel to attend relevant contract related meetings and SOW support?  

Answer:  H.5 is the mandatory DOC clause required in the contract.  In regards to H.5d and H.5e, it is not anticipated that the Offeror will be required to provide any aircraft or vessels.  As such, d and e are not applicable until, at such time, the contract would call for those items to be provided.

Question 12.  Under the requirements of Section H.5, paragraph e, please concur that the required Certificate of Insurance submission requirement under Section L.10.1, paragraph g, does not require vessel liability coverage inclusion within the Certificate of Insurance as submitted within the Business Proposal Volume.  Please additionally concur that should contract performance eventually require the use of vessels, the Contracting Officer shall require, at that time, and as determined by the agency, the requisite liability insurance requirements for which the contractor would then need to provide such liability coverage.  

Answer:  H.5 is the mandatory DOC clause required in the contract.  In regards to H.5d and H.5e, it is not anticipated that the Offeror will be required to provide any aircraft or vessels.  As such, d and e are not applicable until, at such time, the contract would call for those items to be provided.

Question 13.  For pricing purposes, should bidders assume a start date of 14 March 2008, as defined in provision Section L-15 as the award date?  

Answer:  No.  The anticipated date is 31 March 2008 but is not necessarily the actual start date.  However, the actual start date may occur before or after the projected date.

Question 14.  Please reference Section L, paragraph L.10.2, paragraphs a. (Technical Approach), b. (Management Approach/Corporate Experience), and c. (Staffing/Personnel Plan), on page 45 of the RFP; at the end of each paragraph it references paragraphs from Section M that are not listed or identified in Section M of the RFP.  Please clarify, provide, or delete paragraph references M.2.4.2, M.2.4.3, M.2.4.3.a, M.2.4.3.b, and M.2.4.5.  

Answer:  In regards to Section L.10.2 referred to on Page 45 of the solicitation (?Specific areas to be addressed?), the correct references should be M.4.2, M.4.3, M.4.3a, M.4.3b and M.4.5.

Question 15.  Would this procurement be considered for a SDVO Set-Aside?  

Answer:  No.  An RFI was previously issued to determine who could fulfill the Government?s requirement.  Based on industry?s response, it was determined that a small business could meet the Government?s requirements.  

Question 16.  Section L.10.A (page 42) indicates that the proposal shall be prepared "in portrait orientation, except for information presented in tabular/graphic format and oral presentation charts".  There appears to be no other reference to an oral presentation requirement within the document.  Please clarify.  

Answer:  Delete the words ?and oral presentation charts?.  An oral presentation is not required.

Question 17.  Section L.10.2 specific areas to be addressed (page 45) contains several references to Section M.2.4.x.  However, Section M does not contain these sections.  Please confirm what sections are intended by these references (assumed to be M.4.x).  

Answer:  In regards to Section L.10.2 referred to on Page 45 of the solicitation (?Specific areas to be addressed?), section a should read M.4.2 vice M.2.4.2 and section c should read M.4.5 vice M.2.4.5.  These sections (M.4.2 and M.4.5) accurately cross reference Sections L and M.

Question 18.  Section L.10.2 specific areas to be addressed (page 45) and Section M.4.2(f) refer to an "Acceptable Quality Assurance Plan" within the Technical Approach Volume of the proposal.  However, the 20 page allocation for Volume II seems to limit the inclusion of a well-developed plan that can be easily adopted for use under the resultant contract.  Please consider allowing the Quality Assurance Plan to be submitted as an attachment to Volume II with a separate 15 page allocation requirement.  

Answer:  Section L.10.1. VOLUME I ? BUSINESS PROPOSAL, paragraph k refers to the Quality Assurance Plan (QAP) being placed in Volume I.  An amendment will be issued deleting M.4.2.f from the Technical Approach and limiting the QAP to 15 pages.

Question 19.  How many past performance questionnaires are needed?

Answer:  There are not a set number of questionnaires required.  

20.  In Section L ? Volume II instructions, it refers to one page for key and non-key personnel.  Is that per person/resume?

Answer:  Yes.  

21.  FedBizOps and the Standard Form 33 (SF-33) have conflicting addresses.  Which is the correct address?

Answer:  The FedBizOps System and the NOAA Procurement System have different addresses that are standard in the systems.  The address on the SF-33 is being changed manually to reflect an accurate address to ensure the arrival of proposals at the correct office.  The address is modified to the following:

<DESC>NLRB01-07-R-0004	VIDEO SERVICE

Amended to post Vendor questions(s) and Agency answer(s)as related to the solicitation.

Question  1.  How Do I look up your special clauses, rules and regs pertaining to the request for video services.


Answer: The clauses and provisions can be retrieved at www.acquisition.gov.  Click on Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) under Quicklinks located on the far right side of the page.  That will take you to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  Select either the HTML Format button, or the PDF Format button to open up the document.  I recommend using the HTML.  When the page opens, it will be the General Structure and Subparts page.  Scroll down to the end of the page and there you will see Subchapter H ? Clauses and Forms.  Click on Part 52 ? Solicitation Provisions and Contract Clauses and you will be able to view the clauses associated with the notice.

 

Question 2.  Is the NLRB currently doing video services between your different field offices and if so, are you only looking for an offeror to provide the transport (IP, T1, etc) and bridge to connect all the field units simultaneously.

Answer: Yes, we currently do I/P video calls between different Polycom video units. We need that capability (to call from point A to point B without going through a bridge), plus the capability to do bridged calls (with 3 or more parties on one call).

 
Question 3.  What are the allowable charges under the RFP.  For example, space, utilities, labor costs, etc.

Answer: We are only looking for MONTHLY costs to transport video calls, and to do video bridging.

 
Question 4.  Do you want the offeror to be centrally located to your field offices or can the offeror be located anywhere in the US

Answer: Anywhere in the US.

 
Question 5.  Is there a ceiling to the costs of the video services you are requesting.

Answer: The Agency cannot provide you with cost factors pertaining to the notice.  This is information that you should provide to the Government for consideration during evaluation of the proposal.

 
Question 6.  Your notice asks for a technical plan and a cost plan.  Are these two documents to be combined into one package and sent via email.
 

Answer: Yes, the proposal should consist of a Technical Proposal and a Cost Proposal.  If sending the document via e-mail is a problem, it can be send via express mail, as long as it is received by the proposal due date and time cited in the notice.

 
Question 7.  Can I call you back directly if I need further clarification.  

 
Answer: It is preferred that you address all of your concerns/questions via e-mail so that your question(s) can be properly addressed.
