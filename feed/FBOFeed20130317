<DESC>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS for market research purposes. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL BE USED FOR MARKET RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY.
<p>After the results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a purchase order. If at least two qualified small business sources are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>NIST may modify the specifications below for a competitive procurement based on the outcomes of market research.</p>
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial sources that are capable of providing a collaborative industrial robot system, a state-of-the-art industrial robot specifically designed and marketed for safe human-robot collaboration in manufacturing. The robot will be integrated into the Next Generation Robotics and Automation (NGRA) program's dexterous robot testbed as a surrogate for a human operator in human-robot collaboration evaluations in support of the measurement science of robot safety.</p>
<p>The NGRA program is exploring the safety concerns of flexible factory environments in which robots and human operators are expected to interact and collaborate. To provide a safe means of evaluating the effective safety of robots designed for human collaboration, an articulated, sensor-laden, programmable, and controllable human surrogate (i.e., a robot) is necessary to take the place of the human operator during tests with the same level of dexterity as a human, and have advanced force-sensing capabilities to ensure safety when directly interacting with the environment.</p>
<p>The dexterous robot testbed thus requires a collaborative industrial robot system to support the safe integration and development for human-occupied flexible factory environments. This robot will interact with tools, test objects, and other robots within the testbed, and will support the following program areas:</p>
<p>1. Measurement science and standards development in support of emerging robot safety standards that support human-robot collaboration. The robot will be used to validate the design of measurement devices and develop test procedures in support of the relevant portions of collaborative human-robot operation and the drafting of ISO TS 15066;</p>
<p>2. Validation of new measurement science that will gauge the ability of a robot to perform advanced assembly tasks with other robots;</p>
<p>3. Develop collaborative manipulation strategies for human-robot operations;</p>
<p>4. Support the evaluation of safety and performance measurements of AGVs integrated with robot arms.</p>
<p>The minimum required specifications for the collaborative industrial robot system are as follows:<br />1. Robot Capabilities<br />-Number of arms: 2<br />-Degrees of freedom: Greater than or equal to 6 per arm and greater than or equal to 13 for entire robot;<br />-Payload: Greater than or equal to 2 kg per arm;<br />-Maximum arm speed : greater than or equal to 0.5 m/s (max payload) and greater than or equal to 1 m/s (unloaded);<br />-Grippers: Interchangeable grippers (e.g., 2-finger parallel, or pneumatic suction cups) that connect to the tool flange via standard screw configurations (i.e., DIN ISO 9409-1-A50) or through an open architecture to allow us to create flange adapters.</p>
<p>2. Robot Size<br />-Portability: Robot must be light or mobile enough to be repositioned by a single operator throughout the robot testbed (e.g., less than 25 kg for carrying by hand, or mounted on rolling base with locking wheels);<br />-Combined mass of robot and controller: less than 100 kg.</p>
<p>3. Sensing<br />-Force sensing: Torque monitoring on each joint with provided libraries to transform sensed forces to Cartesian coordinate frame, or tool flange-mounted force/torque sensor with vendor-provided force sensing libraries;<br />-Vision: Integrated cameras with machine vision, or provided libraries and interface to add NIST's own to task applications.</p>
<p>4. Safety<br />-Safety circuit: Provision for integration into an existing robot cell with gate interlocks, 3-position enabling devices, and emergency stops per ISO 10218-2;<br />-Compliance: Natural compliance in links/joints (e.g., spring-loaded joints or McKibben artificial muscles) to prevent damaging or being damaged by other robots;<br />-Motor compliance: Back-drivable joint motors</p>
<p>5. Power Consumption<br />-Supply voltage: 120 VAC;<br />-Rated current: Less than 15 A.</p>
<p>6. Control<br />-Controllers: Single controller for both arms, allowing individual and coordinated motions;<br />-Force control: Stock force or impedance control interface for each arm to control direct application of force/torque at the tool flange and the following capabilities: gravity compensation, hand-guiding, teaching via hand-guiding, and power and force limiting (per ISO 10218-2);</p>
<p>7. Interface<br />-PC Connectivity: Communication with an external PC for logging and control robot and sensor data via common network connection (e.g., TCP or UDP), or provide MS Windows libraries for communication;<br />-Data input/output: Digital I/O (via 24VDC bus or DeviceNet interface), or Ethernet interface for 2-way communication with a connected PC.</p>
<p>8. Development environment<br />The collaborative industrial robot system shall have an application programming interface (API) for task programming, and a software development kit (SDK) for task application development in C++, Java, or NI LabVIEW. <br />The collaborative industrial robot system shall be compatible with common control and interface software such as the Robot Operating System (ROS), the Open Robot Control Software (Orocos), or Beckhoff control architecture. PC libraries shall be compatible with MS Windows 7.</p>
<p>9. Training<br />The Contractor shall provide on-site operation and maintenance training for at least three people following installation.</p>
<p>10. Delivery and Installation:<br />The delivery and installation of the collaborative industrial robot system to the NGRA dexterous robot testbed in less than three months ARO.</p>
<p>SUBMISSIONS:<br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 333249, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture a collaborative industrial robot system are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to carol.wood@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report must include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities.</p>
<p>Also, the following information must be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>
<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to Carol Wood are currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>
