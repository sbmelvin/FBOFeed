<DESC>In an effort to maintain and strengthen the United States expertise in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering disciplines the Office of Naval Research has established a National Naval Responsibility (NNR) for Naval Engineering (this includes both naval architecture and marine engineering). This NNR will help to ensure the presence of a strong Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering discipline in the United States for future generations of innovative ship design. 
The long-term goal of the NNR for Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Program initiative is the development of technology and the cultivation of resources that will enhance the ability to develop creative and innovative ship designs. This call for proposals is focused on Modeling and Optimization for Naval Engineering. In particular, the ONR is requesting proposals in the following three areas:
a) Computational Tools for Naval Design
Research is solicited that will advance computational tools for the naval design and acquisition community. Emphasis is on the development of techniques, algorithms, or computational kernels that can be transitioned to a design tool development effort. University/industry or University/Navy teams in which industry or Navy provides a perspective to focus the emerging technology are encouraged. Specific areas of interest are: 
o	modeling of
ボ	internal and external entrained fluid under shock
ボ	implosion
ボ	flow resistance, maneuvering, and seakeeping of novel hull forms
ボ	roll damping
ボ	hydrodynamic-flow/structure interaction
o	integrated analysis & optimization methods for structural mechanics,  acoustics, or hydrodynamics
o	error quantification and aggregation in metamodels
ボ	How can the accuracy of representation of each model, for which a metamodel is being utilized, be assessed?
ボ	Is it possible to assess the aggregate error involved in multidisciplinary modeling of a system of systems?
ボ	Are there guidelines that could be developed for error budgeting for the overall analysis?
o	significant speed-ups in modeling of:
ボ	generation of seaway loads and the resulting ship motion and stresses
ボ	acoustic and non-acoustic signatures

In addition, transition teams are sought to facilitate transitions in 
o	automated domain decomposition for large models, 
o	decision support tools for defining the appropriate level of geometric & mesh fidelity for a desired accuracy
b) Hull Optimization for Multi-Hull Vessels 
A method to optimize the design of high-speed, multi-hull ships is needed. This method will encompass powering, stability, seakeeping, structures, and payload capacity. Currently, the vast majority of U.S. naval ships are relatively large mono-hulls with limited speed requirements. The desire for high-speed transit capabilities has resulted in increased interest in the application of multi-hull platforms for naval missions.  Multi-hull ships have potential advantages over mono-hull ships in terms of larger deck area per ton of displacement, larger transverse stability, higher reserve buoyancy in case of hull penetration, and better seakeeping.  However, the design procedures for multi-hull ships are different from that for mono-hulled ships.  The multi-hull configuration typically requires a 3-D design approach, compared to many of the standard 2-D approximations performed for mono-hulls.  Additionally, with the Navy｡ｦs current interest in higher speeds and, in many cases, smaller ships, optimization of multi-hulls requires concurrent consideration of powering performance, payload capacity, stability, and seakeeping.  An optimization process and algorithms need to be developed that can be utilized by early stage ship design synthesis models.  This capability should include:
o	Early stage structural design methods that utilize longitudinal, transverse and slamming loads across a range of speed parameters with a consideration for lifetime fatigue performance. 
o	Algorithms to address the impacts of wave-making interference relative to longitudinal and transverse spacing between hulls.  
o	 Optimization of 3-D hull form shape and size characteristics and relative location for multi-hull configurations based on powering performance, payload capacity, stability and seakeeping.
o	Refined and validated multi-hull seakeeping assessment tools.
c) Automated Functional Arrangements for Submarines and Surface Ships
Early stage arrangements of submarines and surface ships are a critical component to the successful design of new and innovative concepts.  Early stage designs have tended to initially concentrate on the geometric arrangement of a number of important weapons and propulsion systems since these have a critical impact on the arrangement of the remaining compartments.  After these major systems/compartments are located, surface ship arrangements have tended to concentrate the assumption that the provision of sufficient area or volume will support later detailed arrangement of equipment and compartments within the available space.  However, this assumption results in a loss of fidelity for designs developed to meet uniquely different missions.  In submarines, further arrangement definition is a necessity to insure the feasibility of the design to establish and maintain a neutrally buoyant condition.  Existing design synthesis programs can assist in defining the required design arrangement and characteristics.  However, for both submarines and surface ships, adequate arrangement detail dictates manual development of the arrangement design.  When radically new concepts are required, problems arise with respect to the time and expertise it takes to manually develop effective, consistent arrangement designs. 

A tool set is required to assist the designer by automating, to the maximum extent practical, early stage functional arrangements.  It is envisioned that this tool set would take the designers｡ｦ initial layout of critical spaces (major weapons, machinery and other major space requirements) and then follow a set of rules that insure required functional adjacencies, as well as, personnel and cargo flow and access in the layout of the remaining space requirements.   Once a full functional arrangement is available, improved algorithms can be developed to predict service loads and distributive and other auxiliary system characteristics within compartments based on the functional role assigned to the compartment.  This tool set may function independently or be integrated with design synthesis tools.

<DESC>C.2.1 PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PURPOSE The purpose of this project is to provide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP), its various Divisions and other components of CDC with support for disseminating information and transferring knowledge related to research, treatment and care, and prevention efforts to CDC constituents, partners and stakeholders and the general public. This shall be accomplished by providing expertise and systems for the proactive diffusion and dissemination of information and the reactive response to the needs of the NCHSTP, other CDC programs and CDC target audiences. To respond to the current user needs and to utilize state-of-the-art technology will require a major redirection in the design and operation of services of the CDC National Prevention Information Network (CDC NPIN). The future CDC NPIN will implement and incorporate the recommendations and the findings of the NPIN Assessment Study, which is based on current user needs and CDC programmatic requirements and will remain flexible as needs and technology change. The project will support multiple information systems on behalf of NCHSTP and other related CDC program needs. It is a complex requirement incorporating data from federal, state, and local governments as well as private and not-for-profit sectors. It is not a traditional clearinghouse operation?these requirements involve techniques of knowledge and information transfer based on state-of-the-art technology that will afford rapid response mechanisms. Delivery of technical assistance is a primary requirement with the goal of building capacity for transferring information and knowledge into public health practice. Information services and support must be rapid, accurate, and flexible in their delivery mechanisms, dealing with different working conditions and environments. The project will be required to offer ?value-added? products and services where research, guidelines, policies and information from CDC must be translated, summarized, organized, stored for retrieval, and disseminated in various formats, through a variety of channels, in a timely manner. C.3 BACKGROUND AND NEED C.3.1 Introduction The challenge of this procurement is to make the CDC National Prevention Information Network (CDC NPIN) services and support a ?state-of-the-art? customer-based operation that can take advantage of technology now and in the future. For the duration of the project and beyond, the Office of Communications, NCHSTP, looks to advance the development of information services that provide: A. Interactivity designed to enhance partnerships, individual responsiveness, promote better communication, disseminate information, and assess professional and public information needs. B. Ease of access for all. C. Use of current technology to broaden the range of prevention information dissemination and to reduce information-transfer costs. D. Networked linking and transfer of science-based health information with and to our primary audiences. E. Increased awareness of NCHSTP and other CDC programs that use these services and the value of their information. F. Adoption and utilization of NCHSTP and CDC prevention information by all of its audiences. C.3.2 Background The services and products of the CDC National Prevention Information Network (CDC NPIN) provide a primary mechanism for the National Center for HIV, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHSTP) and other CDC programs to support prevention partners, stakeholders, and other constituents. The business of CDC NPIN is knowledge/information transfer. C.3.3 The Challenge In the past decade, with the expanded use of the Internet as a channel for health information, there has been a proliferation of providers of information about HIV/AIDS. The Web also offers sites for STD and TB information, although not in the volume that can be found for HIV/AIDS. The newer technology has changed the way people access information and there has been a corresponding expansion and demand for information. The original mission of these services was cast in the broadest terms by the Presidential Commission on the HIV Epidemic and by the Omnibus Legislation of 1988. Early efforts were clearly ?demand driven? as CDC NPIN and its predecessor, the CDC National AIDS Clearinghouse, struggled to be responsive to all legitimate information needs and the resulting pressures of increasing demand. The dramatic changes taking place in the dissemination of information and the increased number of sources of information, have fostered a spirit of change and a need to rethink the services and products of NPIN, to tailor them to current user needs, and to take advantage of evolving technology. In addition, the level of sophistication of NPIN audiences is heightened, and their information/knowledge needs require more depth and breadth in content areas. The Office of Communications (OC), NCHSTP, has the responsibility to assure close collaboration of the Center?s various information and communication efforts, along with those being undertaken by other parts of CDC. The OC provides coordination of information services and support for NCHSTP and for other CDC users of these services. A customer-based assessment of the mission/purpose, audience, services, and products of NPIN was carried out in the past year. The evaluation project offered an opportunity to determine user needs, to find out which services and products are meeting those needs and which are no longer relevant. The competition of a contract to provide information services and support can then assure that the findings of this study be employed as guidance for the future. Major findings of the study, conclusions and recommendations can be found at Exhibit G, Reference Materials. As the report indicates, this project supports multiple information systems on behalf of the NCHSTP and other CDC CIO?s. It is a highly complex requirement incorporating data and information from the federal, state, and local governments, academia, community-based organizations, NGO?s and industry, serving a broad audience that includes health professionals and the general public. The redirection of this project requires a wide range of personnel with varied expertise, including, but not limited to: health care professionals, medical information specialists, database experts, systems analysts, Web designers, graphic artists, translators, inventory management specialists, librarians, health educators, and administrative personnel with experience in managing complex and demanding task-oriented projects. The contractor must have appropriate scientific, public health, medical, health communications knowledge as well as expertise in knowledge transfer, data abstraction, data validation, technical writing, and communicating complex scientific and medical issues in terms and formats that are easily understood. In order to take advantage of new and evolving technologies and changing user needs and preferences, NCHSTP anticipates substantial changes in work requirements during the contract term. There will be a need for transition of services as changes are made. The Contractor should be prepared to show an understanding of the transition process?preserving the value of current services and products as new or changed ones are put in place. CDC NPIN cannot simply ?shut down? and change. New directions must be put in place gradually and without interruption of services. C.3.4 Customer Base Priority targets for the services of NPIN and for communications and information efforts include state and local health agencies, community-based organizations, state and local education agencies, national and regional organizations, STD constituent clinics, training centers, the media, and academic institutions and researchers. NPIN also provides support for educational institutions, students, and business and labor organizations seeking information and assistance to deal with HIV, STD, and TB in the workplace, and to religious organizations/institutions involved in education and outreach services. The NPIN services target partners in HIV, STD, and TB prevention. However, the general public has access to the phone lines and the Web site. Therefore, the information services provided must be comprehensive, flexible, and tailored where appropriate to target audiences. Marketing efforts, however, will be directed to audiences and institutions that are targeted as primary audiences, as defined by the government. The emphasis on the Internet and evolving technologies is a primary channel for information dissemination, requiring refocusing services as appropriate. The government is hopeful that this competition will produce a Contractor with creative ideas about how to reach target audiences and how to serve the needs of all customers of NPIN services. The Office of Communications is also looking for creative ideas about how to monitor and assess customer satisfaction and needs in a changing technological environment. The CDC National HIV and STD Hotline historically have used NPIN facilities and personnel to maintain their referral database and to execute their fulfillment needs. This requires a great deal of collaboration and coordination between contractors. In addition, NPIN has occasionally responded to information requests from members of the general public. At some time during the life cycle of this contract, the following requirements will be transitioned to a new CDC-wide Consumer Response Contract: A. Solicitation and marketing of toll-free lines to the general public, B. Support for toll-free lines targeting the general public in the form of a reference and referral database for use by information specialists, and C. Fulfillment Operations for toll-free lines in the form of storage and distribution of materials that disseminate information to the general public in response to requests for information received through the toll-free lines. For at least the first year and first option year of this contract (2 years), the CDC National HIV and STD Hotline will remain a primary customer of NPIN services?requiring maintenance of a referral database and fulfillment of orders. (See Hotline Support, under ?Non-core requirements.?) Additionally, NPIN will continue to support occasional requests from the general public for the first year and first option year of this contract (2 years), after which these requirements will transition to the proposed new CDC Consumer Response Contract. NPIN will continue to offer full service to its primary audiences (see C.3 Customer Base), including toll-free lines, reference and referral databases, and fulfillment operations, throughout the proposed 5-years of the contract. C.4 Tasks The Contractor, as an independent organization and not as an agent of the government, shall furnish the equipment, personnel, facilities, supplies, materials, and other resources necessary to develop, maintain, and operate information services and products which will furnish and provide access to HIV/AIDS, STD, TB and other information regarding preventable diseases and conditions. The primary function of this contract will be to provide current health information services and products in support of the NCHSTP. All resource materials produced/maintained under this contract, including databases, all information products, all data, mailing lists, Web sites, telephone protocols (Intellectual Property), etc. are the property of the Government.

<DESC>NASA/JSC has a requirement for a Zeiss Axiovert 200 MAT metallograph with excellent quality digital graphics that allows for easy operation and affords clear and concise pictures.  The Zeiss Axiovert 200 MAT has the following specifications: 1) a unique black and white digital camera system that produces high resolution digital pictures, (competitors have gone to color which does not produce high quality images necessary for failure analysis); 2) differential interference contrast (DIC) analysis which operates with circular polarized light that solves imaging problems; 3) quick and easy operations with a motorized turret; and, 4)  the required low magnification eyepieces to obtain macro images.   NASA/JSC intends to purchase the item from Carl Zeiss, Inc. in accordance with Federal Acquisiton Regulation 6.302-1. Zeiss is a manufacturer in a limited and highly specialized field. No other company can provide equipment that meets the Government's requirements for quality and accuracy. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on July 22, 2003.	Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>This is a notice of intent that WR-ALC anticipates issuing an engineering services task order against an existing Basic Ordering Agreement (F09603-02-G-0013) with Raytheon Company, Goleta CA (MC 06129).  The task is to provide engineering and technical services applicable to develop functional replacements, the associated technical data packages, and test program sets for three AN/ALQ-184 (V) electronic attack pod subassemblies that have functional deficiencies and component obsolescence issues.  This effort will review and analyze the functions of the original Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs), evaluate accomplished AN/ALQ-184 (V) system hardware and software upgrades and scheduled upgrades that have created functional deficiencies in the old design, identify possible non-form, non-fit, but function replacements for discontinued or obsolete components and prototype, integrate and test the redesigned units.   The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received within forty-five days (thirty days if award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

This acquisition may/does involve technology that has a military or space application.  The only US contractors who may participate are those that are certified and registered with DLSC (1-800-352-3572) and have a legitimate business purpose.  US contractors must submit a copy of their current, approved DD Form 2345 with their request for solicitation.  To request this certification write to the Commander, Defense Logistics Services Center, ATTN: DLSC-FEB, Federal Center, Battle Creek MI 49017-3084 and request a copy of Department of Defense Form 2345 or call DLSC at the above number.  The solicitation/data package will be mailed to the data custodian identified in block 3 of the DD Form 2345.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  MOU country sources must contact the Contracting Officer within 15 calendar days of the date of this synopsis notice to receive a copy of the solicitation at the time it is initially issued.  Issuance of the RFP will not be delayed to review requests from MOU country sources received after 15 days or from non-MOU country sources.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small-business set-aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).  Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.

<DESC>Advanced Life Support Technologies And Research (ALSTAR)-  Human Effectiveness Directorate, Biodynamics and Protection Division, AFRL/HEP, Brooks City-Base, TX and Wright-Patterson AFB OH is seeking qualified sources for the subject program.  The extreme environments encountered in modern and future combat and support aircraft limit the ability of our aircrews to operate effectively and are often a cause or a factor in aircraft mishaps.  Research is required to develop new and innovative technologies to advance aircrew protective equipment, fatality and injury prevention, procedures, training methodologies, and information technology.  The effects of impact and sustained accelerations, altitude, spatial disorientation, warfighter fatigue, mechanical stresses, and other stressors can have a negative impact on mission performance and possibly lead to aircrew incapacitation.  The Government requests interested parties to submit capability information and expression of interest on the research areas noted below.  Government furnished facilities at Brooks City-Base TX and Wright-Patterson AFB OH would be made available to support contract personnel along with Government furnished equipment which includes sleep laboratory, human centrifuges, impact acceleration sled, vertical deceleration tower, cockpit and equipment integration laboratory, research altitude chambers, visual orientation laboratory, and manikin development laboratory to support contracted research activities.  The contract services will provide scientific and technical personnel, equipment, and human subjects to support research programs.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station (NSWCDD CSS), Panama City, Florida, intends to award a sole-source purchase order to DYNAMIC INSTRUMENTS, INC. of 3860 Calle Fortunada San Diego, California 92123-1825 for an upgrade to the commercially available Software used to dynamically balance lift fans and propellers on Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC).  The software upgrade will allow for easier balancing of lift fans by allowing recalculation of sensitivity and phase lag for specific assemblies.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition because the software being upgraded is proprietary to Dynamic Instruments. Thus DYNAMIC INSTRUMENTS, INC. is the only vendor that can meet this requirement.  NAICS Code 334519 Applies. FSC is 3695. SBA Size Standard is 500 Employees.

<DESC>NOTICE: FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION Project Name: Re-Stripe Park Roads, Great Basin National Park (GRBA), White Pine County, Baker, Nevada. Solicitation No. Q8420030321. The National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior, is soliciting quotations for a firm, fixed-price contract to furnish all labor, materials, equipment and expertise necessary to perform all operations required for the sucessful completion of the above named project.  Work includes, but is not limited to the following:  (1). The base bid consists of re-striping of the asphalt roadways within GRBA by repainting the existing striping and using them as a guide; (2). The bid additive consists of re-striping the asphalt parking areas within GRBA also by repainting the existing striping and using them as a guide; (3) Wheeler Peak Scenic Drive, 12 miles, is the longest run in this project.  It rises from the Park Visitor Center area at 6,800 feet elevation to over 10,000 feet elevation.  It is steep and winding grade often exceeding 8% with unprotected drop offs and areas with no shoulders. There is a safety concern for visitors and Park staff since traffic will need to be maintained on this road during the striping operation.  This road will get only a single centerline stripe due to the narrow width of the road surface; (4). The striping of the Park entrance road, 0.7 miles, and parking area at the Visitor Center will need to perfomed in such a manner as to not curtail vehicle and pedestrian traffic to the from the Park Visitor Center; (5). Two parking areas, Summit Trailhead Parking and the Bristlecone Parking area are located at 10,000 feet elevation; (6). The contract duration shall be no longer than 5 calendar days and can can occur any time in the Summer of 2003. A start date after Labor Day 2003 weekend would avoid much of the summer visitation and GRBA rarely has snowfall at 10,000 feet prior to this time; and (7) All work will take place within 12 miles of the GRBA Visitor Center area. The NAICS code for this project is 237310 and the small business size standard is $28.5 million.  In accordance with FAR 36.204, the price range for this $25,000 to $100,000.

<DESC>This project requires the contractor to remove iceplant from steep cliffs, using climbing gear, around the Headlands and Lighthouse areas of Point Reyes National Seashore in Marin County, CA.  Iceplant has invaded hundreds of acres of coastal dunes and bluffs and is having a direct impact on coastal bluff vegetation communities and rare plants.  Removal of iceplant on these steep, crumbling, 300 to 600 ft high cliffs has not been possible using traditional methods.  This project will involve the use of skilled climbers to safely remove these inaccessible populations of this invasive non-native plant.  The contractor will be required to provide all labor and equipment to manually remove the iceplant from the cliffs.  The cliffs are composed of Point Reyes conglomerate, a very unique rock formation that can be unstable.  The total project area consists of patches of iceplant spread over 9 acres on slopes of 30 to 75 degrees.  Completion of work is estimated to be within 4 to 6 weeks, assuming a crew of 5 working 4 days/week.  A variation in crew size or days is acceptable provided all work is completed by mid- November 2003.  Weekend/Holiday work will not be permitted.  Harsh weather (cold, wet, wind, and/or fog) can be expected to impact planned work efforts.  Specific requirements for this project include 1) Climbing - using ropes and other climbing and safety gear; 2) Climbing and rope use on unstable cliffs over 100 ft high; 3) Management of exotic plants, primarily iceplant; 4) Working with tools to control vegetation while on belay; and 5) Being responsible for safety of employees in a hazardous work environment.  A Request for Quotation (RFQ) will be available for electronic access only, on or about July 14, 2003, and will close 2-3 weeks after issuance.  Access the RFQ at:  http://www.fedbizopps.gov or through the DOI National Business Center site at:  http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  This acquisition is being solicited under the Simplified Acquisiton Procedures of FAR Part 13 and is reserved exclusively for Small Business concerns.

<DESC>SSASIM SOFTWARE LICENSE AND SUPPORT SYNOPSIS 


The Social Security Administration (SSA) intends to lease six (6) copies of SSASIM Model Software for one (1) year from Policy Simulation Group, Inc (PSI), Washington, DC.  Further, the SSASIM licenses will allow SSA to acquire software modifications from PSI as the need arises for more efficient policy valuations in retirement (OASI), disability (DI), and income assistance programs.

PSI is the only known source with authority and expertise to provide and modify the "software" as SSA requires. 

Any other vendor claiming to have requisite authority and expertise to provide or modify the "software" must submit verifiable information that supports such assertion.  Conversely, any other vendor that can provide comparable commercial off-the-shelf-(COTS) software must submit verifiable information (i.e., product literature, customer references, and product price) on the relevant capabilities and support for such COTS software.  Any suggested COTS software package must be accessible to SSA for at least four (4) years, cost less than $20,000, and satisfy the following requirements: 

General
Simulate the impact of policy changes to SSA's Trust Funds, particularly projecting actuarial balances using a similar methodology to that used by the Office of the Chief Actuary. The model will be used to estimate the effects of policy changes on individuals and the economy and as a comparison for program cost projections made by the Office of the Chief Actuary. Below are listed the various elements we require.

1. Activity One:

Produce 75-year actuarial cost projections (from baseline data 耀uch as age-gender earnings and gross domestic product --- that is obtained for year 1999) under alternative calculations.  Generate an alternative calculation that literally combines the two Trust Funds (OASI and DI) into a third, theoretical OASDI Trust Fund to produce 75-year actuarial balances.  In addition, upon trust fund exhaustion, two alternative discount rate assumptions should be available: (1) rates based on the return that would be realized given the Trust Fund asset allocation policy for that year and (2) rates based on the assumption that an exhausted Trust Fund will simply borrow at the Treasury bond rate from the Treasury's general fund. 

2. Activity Two:

Specify lifestyle earning profiles for eighteen individuals by birth cohort and simulate a wide variety of OASI program experience statistics for each of them (including the effects of their being married under different policies).  The COTS package must allow model to accept a weighting probability for each individual and combine the eighteen individual statistics into an overall (population-like) statistic.

The COTS model must be able to run in a stochastic-assumption mode and/or an endogenous-growth mode.  The macrosimulation model will also need an embedded cohort model, which uses standard dynamic microsimulation methods with a small, unrepresentative sample of individuals. The cohort model should be embedded inside the macroeconomic model in the sense that the macroeconomic model determines the macroeconomic and demographic environment within which individual lives are simulated.

3. Activity Three:

The COTS macroeconomic model must produce estimates of program income and cost for both OASI and DI and must be able to simulate OASI and DI benefits for individuals and families.

Responses to this announcement must be received within fifteen (15) days after this publication date and should refer to synopsis number 03-1004.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SYNOPSIS ANNOUNCEMENT FOR THE FEDBIZOPS/COMMERCE BUSINESS DAILY:  (CB LINER)

Task:
Chemical/Biological (CB) Liner for Large Capacity Shelter (AF Medium Shelter).

Objective:
The 311 HSW, Human Systems Program Office is seeking information on the Industry痴 capability and materials available for development of a Chemical/Biological (CB) liner to be used with the latest Air Force Medium Shelter system (MSS) currently in inventory.  This CB liner in conjunction with other CB components in inventory will then provide a collective protection (CP) system that is needed in bare base, medical, and special operations deployments worldwide.  After successful prototype liner testing, procurement of production units is proposed starting in FY04.  From this point on, this project will be called the 鏑arge Capacity Shelter CB Liner.

Background:
A prototype 渡on-CB liner made of lightweight polyester was developed and installed into a MSS.  An initial prototype check for form and fit was conducted and a few design changes were identified at that time.  Updated design drawings, the prototype liner, and a performance specification will be used to begin the acquisition of the LCS CB liner.  Currently, a 5-layer laminate CB Liner is used with the Air Force痴 collective protection systems that provide the chemical and biological resistance to liquid and vapor threats.
 
Requirement:
Based on the concept of operations for bare base and expeditionary special operations, a large capacity collective protection system, such as the 1,500 ft2 Medium Shelter, is required to provide mass sheltering of deployed personnel. The intent of this RFI is to collect information that will be used to determine the feasibility of developing a CB liner system (using current laminate or new materials meeting or exceeding existing capabilities) for the MSS.  Information is required on Industry痴 capabilities to develop a LCS CB Liner using the government provided prototype liner, drawings and performance specification that will meet or exceed the Joint Services needs.  Firms having the ability to design and manufacture liner should submit specific information that documents their capabilities and potential to successfully execute this effort.  Such information should include but is not limited to:  potential materials, engineering design, manufacturing techniques (seaming, stitching, sealing, etc.) and capabilities, test and evaluation results, and affordability.  The LCS CB Liner will interface with the standard M28 CPE Type II vestibule membrane opening and be compatible with existing CP liner closures adopted in the Air Force Medical Shelter System (AF Small Shelter) shelters.   
Approximate dimensions for each liner are: 29 ｽ feet wide by 26 feet long with a height of 10 feet.  Each MSS will use 2 liners that will connect to each other to create approximate a 1,500 ft2 toxic free area.  See pictures and drawings attached, this documentation is to be considered early prototype and should be referenced for information only.

A Draft Request for Proposal (RFP) will be released on or about 15 August 2003.  An electronic version will be posted on the Government Website www.fedbizops.gov

THE SUBMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION IS FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT TO BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR ANY ITEMS/SERVICES, OR FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR THE INFORMATION RECEIVED. NO SOLICITATION DOCUMENT EXISTS OR ARE GUARENTEED TO BE ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THIS RFI.
  
The government will retain comments and information received in response to this RFI.  Proprietary information should be identified as Company Proprietary.  Do not use Government security classification markings.  Sources submitting a response and interested also in making a technical presentation may arrange to do so by contacting              
Mr. Michael Forbis, Contracting Officer, at 210-536-6390 or through e-mail at Michael.Forbis@brooks.af.mil.  All written responses/comments must be received	 by	 4 p.m. CDT, 4 Aug 03.  Firms responding should indicate their business size and status (i.e., small business (S), large business (L), small disadvantaged business (SBD), 8(a), HUBZone, etc.)  Responses should be addressed to:

<DESC>Air Education and Training Command (AETC) needs civilian pilots to fly Air Force T-1A aircraft on Intermediate Navigator training course sorties at Pensacola NAS. These civilian pilots must be type rated in the Beech 400 jet. These civilian pilots must either be commercial pilots type rated in the Beech 400 with an instructor pilot rating in the Beech 400, or they must be an Airline Transport Pilot (ATP) rated pilot with a type rating in the Beech 400 jet. In addition to flying local training sorties for student navigators in the Intermediate Navigator training course, ferry flights of the aircraft must be made for periodic maintenance inspections at Laughlin AFB in Del Rio, Texas. These periodic maintenance inspections are required after approximately each 200 flying hours on each airframe. Student loading in the Intermediate Navigator training course at Pensacola NAS can vary from 120 students annually to 360 students annually. If maximum student loading is experienced, an annual flight load of approximately 6,800 hours for the Intermediate Navigator training course can be expected. The pilots who fly the Intermediate Navigator training course sorties act as the pilot in command of the sortie. This entails a preflight briefing, filing of a flight plan, review of aircraft maintenance forms, preflight of the aircraft, use of all Air Force applicable checklists, obtaining a clearance, taxiing the aircraft, flying a prebriefed profile, filling out aircraft maintenance forms after the flight which could include a maintenance personnel debrief, and a crew debriefing. The contractor should plan on maintaining administrative tracking of all personnel to include tracking of currency of all pilots flying Air Force aircraft. Supervision of all airborne Air Force T-1A aircraft must also be performed by a rated pilot on the ground. This ground supervisor aids airborne crews with inflight emergencies. 

The performance period will be a basic 12 month period with 6 one year option periods.

<CONTACT>Point of Contact - https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop/Public/ASP/dcop.asp
<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>NA The Army Contracting Agency, Dugway Proving Ground, Utah  is requesting proposals for Field Range Testing & Laboratory Support Services to be performed at the West Desert Test Center (WDTC).   The WDTC plans, conducts, evaluates, and reports on development al, operational tests, and operational training scenarios, to assess the military value of chemical and biological (CB) defense systems, incendiary and smoke/obscuration munitions systems, and related operational concepts. The WDTC also plans, conducts, ev aluates, and reports on non-CB testing for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies (e.g., environmental assessment/impact evaluations, weapons and munitions demilitarization, hazard assessments, and technical / logistical support of Air Force operations at DPG). DPG participates in development of technology and methodology to support assigned testing. Test programs include evaluation of munitions, CB detection and protection devices, testing to determine nuclear / biological / chemical (N BC) contamination / decontami nation survivability of various DoD materiel and equipment, and a wide range of developmental testing and applied research related to tactics, techniques, and procedures. Test procedures involve artillery and mortar fire, aeri al spray trials, physical and environmental stress testing, human factors engineering, virtual reality methodology/implementation, accelerated climatic storage, contamination / decontamination evaluations, and performance and reliability testing of items i n the field or within enclosed chambers. Chemical and biological laboratory support is required to conduct these tests.  Such activities include growth and purification of simulants and organisms (including Biolab Safety level 3 operation).  Simulant agent  materials are frequently disseminated to challenge detection and protection equipment and to evaluate concepts of deployment of detection and protection equipment.  Chemical analytical activities are performed to support test and compliance programs to sa tisfy Army, State, and Federal Government regulations on safety, surety, hazardous waste, and the environment.  The WDTC is currently certified under the ISO 9000 international standard. Management has adopted the policy of providing equipment and services  that have requisite quality to guarantee customer satisfaction throughout the test cycle.  The ISO 9000 certif ication is essential in adding creditability to the policy.  To achieve this objective, it is the policy of WDTC to establish and maintain an ef ficient and effective quality system, planned and developed in conjunction with all management functions. Determination of conformance of work with customer and regulatory requirements is verified on the basis of objective evidence of quality.  The Contrac tor shall fully support and comply with the WDTC ISO 9000 and earned value management requirements. The Contractor shall be required to perform various tasks which will include, but not be limited to, testing for evaluation of various interactions of chemi cal agents including, but not limited to, tabun (GA), sarin (GB), soman (GD), distilled mustard (HD) , nerve agent (VX), chemical agent simulants, and non traditional agents (Toxic Industrial Compounds/Chemical (TICS), and or Toxic Industrial Material, (TI MS)) with existing or developmental military material/equipment under various environmental conditions; testing for evaluation of various biological agents including, but not limited to, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Clostrid ium botulinum toxins, Ricin toxin, Staphylococcal enterotoxins, Brucella species, Burkholderia mallei , B. pseudomallei, vaccine strains of bacterial and viral pathogens including vaccines of agents not listed above; and munitions including but not limited  to mortar, 155mm artillery, and smoke and obscurant devices. The Contractor shall be required to set up samplers, test fixtures, photo instrumentation, radio c ommunication, software support, and range control for various field and chamber test sites in support of other types of tests. All generated waste shall be handled in accordance with (IAW) applicable regulations and local procedures. Specific task assignme nts shall be issued by the Government to implement the general requirements of this contract. Each task assignment will define the specific type of field, chamber, virtual reality methodology/implementation, laboratory, test support, analytical, compliance , and protocol functions to be performed.  Each specific task assignment will contain sufficient background information (e.g., specifications, drawings, work breakdown structures, milestone schedules, earned value management (EVM) requirements IAW DoD Manu al 5000.2 (refer to Attachment D of DoD Manual 5000.2 for EVM requirements), quality assurance and inspection standards, and other appropriate descriptive material) for the Contractor to determine the scope of work and the performance criteria used for com pleting the work satisfactorily.  Task performance documentation generated by the Contractor shall be made available for review by the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) and/or Contracting Officer.

My apologies if they are misspelled. 2. LTC Westenhaver covered the elements of amendment 1. The solicitation is an Invitation for Bid (IFB) not a Request for Proposal (RFP) Davis Bacon, wage rates, will apply to this proposed contract On page 11 of the solicitation FAR clause 52.219-3 should be deleted 3. Page 3, item 4 (Additive Bid Item 3) of the solicitation should make reference to Sheet A7.1A rather than Sheet A7.1. 4. Maj. Rick Oxner, the Base Civil Engineer for this project, conducted the rest of the meeting with assistance from the Cromwell representatives. Some of the topics covered were: It is critical that all standoff distances are maintained due to new force protection requirements (example: 82 feet from building to roads and parking lots) Job site is fairly flat so there is not much of a need for excavation other than for utilities. Additive Bid Item (ABI) 2 is remaining landscaping that is not covered in the Base Bid. All sod is in the Base Bid. Do not use square footage tables in the blue prints for your calculations for carpet. Drawings  A.1.3  2ft X 2ft dropped in ceiling and security mesh over mechanical A.3.2  Part of the roof trim will have to be painted to match the brick work on the front. A.6.5 Names will change on the plaque. All system furniture is to be provided and installed by the government. Wall lockers are to be provided and installed by the contractor. Pay particular attention to the transition (carpet to tile) strip under the doors. Do not air-condition bathrooms. They only have radiant heat panels and vents. Underground electrical vaults should be covered with 6 inches of red concrete and then sand. Other elements of the plans, specifications and addendums 1 and 2 were covered and than a site visit was conducted. 5. Two very important components of this amendment are Addendums 1 and 2 which contain numerous changes. 6. Anyone that bought an original set of specifications and drawings from Cromwell Architects Engineers will automatically be sent a free copy of addendums 1 and 2 from Cromwell. Anyone not receiving their free copy by 8 July 2003 should contact Cromwell a t (501) 372 2900. All others wanting a copy of addendums 1 and 2 may also contact Cromwell. 7. Any technical questions regarding this project should be faxed to Major Rick Oxner at (501) 987-8463. Administrative questions should be faxed to LTC Randy Westenhaver at (501) 212 4419. 8.

<SOLNBR>OPR03000682
<RESPDATE>080703
<ARCHDATE>08222003

<DESC>The Legislative Information Management System (LIMS) is the legislative tracking system for the U.S. House of Representatives.  The U.S. House of Representatives requires Contractor management analysis and technical services in four (4) task areas encompassing the final stage requirements of the LIMS Replacement Project as follows:

.	Task 1 - Detailed Analysis of Alternative Solutions (UNIX (HP-UX) vs. WINDOWS 200X). 
.	Task 2 - Proof of Concept Demonstration of the Selected Solution. 
.	Task 3 - Detailed Porting and Implementation Plan of Selected Alternative (Option).
.	Task 4 - Implementation of the Porting Plan (Option).

For purposes of this Statement of Work and the work of this contract, the term 菟ort means the replatforming of application software and data from one operating system to another, where the code and databases are substantially maintained intact.  Changes to components should be restricted to instances where they are necessary due to the differing operating environments.  In addition, for purposes of this RFP, we have stated the current Congress as the 108th.  Since the port may occur in the 109th, the bidders should assume that the port will be for the current and previous Congress at the start of Task 4.  Where this document states Windows 200X, the Contractor should assume Windows 2003 or later.

In summary, Task 1 consists of a detailed alternatives analysis effort that includes the Contractor:

.	Reviewing documentation prepared during the LIMS Requirements Analysis and Technical Recommendation stage (a previously completed stage of the project), 
.	Reviewing the source code, the database, and JCL for the entire system, and 
.	Creating a detailed analysis report that compares UNIX (HP-UX) and Windows 200X as operating systems/environments for the LIMS application with the Natural code and ADABAS tables ported from the original system.  

Task 2 consists of the Contractor performing a proof of concept by porting the Bill Briefs component of LIMS to an UNIX (HP-UX) platform or Windows 200X based platform. The House's decision of which platform will be based on the analysis performed in Task 1.  The Bill Briefs component consists of approximately 308 modules and approximately 53,845 lines of source code and associated JCL.

All subsequent tasks are designated as options to be exercised at the discretion of the House after acceptance of the preceding task.   

During Task 3, the Contractor will provide a detailed porting and implementation plan for the porting of the entire LIMS system from the mainframe to the selected alternative platform.  This plan will need to include the planning for the remaining system life cycle activities (porting, quality assurance and testing, implementation, user acceptance, and sustainment).  The plan must include but will not be limited to the following:

.	The plan must describe in detail how the system will be ported.  It must address whether the system will be ported module by module, bridged to the mainframe, etc.  It must also describe how all of the JCL, source code, and database tables will be ported, converted, or rewritten.   It must address in detail both automated and manual porting approaches.  Since the COBOL and Assembler code must be replaced, the plan must specifically address the source code in these languages.
.	The plan must include a Quality Assurance and Testing plan for the Contractor痴 work and define how the final ported 
system will be verified by the Contractor to ensure the system maintains the same (or better) functionality as the mainframe 
system.   
.	The plan must provide a complete implementation plan including a complete timeline and detailed Work Breakdown 
Schedule (WBS) including key milestones. 
.	The plan must make provisions for user acceptance including detailed acceptance criteria and testing procedures to be conducted by end users.  The plan must define whether parallel data entry or other methods requiring extensive end user input will be required.  The plan must also detail any additional training and documentation necessary for end users that the Contractor will provide in Task 4.   At a minimum, acceptance criteria must include successful automated comparison of all publications, reports, and output files within LIMS on both the mainframe and the ported systems.  User interface acceptance criteria must minimally include all data on the current user interface screens within LIMS.
.	Several non-LIMS systems and LIMS maintain interfaces with one another including the Clerk痴 website, Government Printing Office, the Senate, and the Library of Congress.   The acceptance criteria must include tests to confirm that the data exchanged remains the same as in the current system.
.	The plan must specify the length of time necessary to transfer the required knowledge to House technical personnel to enable them to fully support the system after the completion of Task 4.  
.	The plan must include a configuration management plan including documented procedures to track changes to software and the implementation of those changes. 
	

Task 4 will be the implementation of the entire porting plan as created and approved in Task 3 and the Contractor will accept responsibility for the completion of the port. Beyond the implementation, the Contractor must provide a warranty period assuring support for twelve (12) months in order to handle contractor errors related to the port that may arise.  The Contractor shall provide an hourly rate for any non-port related support issues.

Total SEED assistance for Albania is about $28 million annually, of which USAID/Albania manages roughly $21.5 million.  In addition to the Director, the Mission is staffed with three Direct Hires (USDHs), six US Personal Service Contractors (USPSCs), and 13 Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs).  The Mission痴 Strategic Plan is organized around a Results Framework containing five strategic objectives (SOs), which link with E&E Bureau goals for: strengthened democracy (SO 2.1); civil society and rule of law (SO 2.2); economic restructuring (SO 1.3); health sector reform (SO 4.1); and special initiatives (SO 4.2).

USG interests in reducing corruption in Albania is an important influence on these new directions, so expanded emphasis is being given to rule of law, civil society, democracy, governance, and anti-trafficking of human beings which fall within the above defined SOs.  Based on recent assessments and to streamline management in light of continuing staffing constraints, scopes of work (SOWs) are being developed for a limited number of new umbrella type contracts and grants which will be awarded this fiscal year and early next. The Mission is designing, contracting and implementing these new mechanism in a carefully phased manner to avoid lapses in the provision of key technical assistance and training to the GoA, NGOs, and the Albanian private sector.

As an additional mechanism to strengthen Mission management under existing OE and staffing constraints, Mission intends to contract for the intermittent services of a Senior Multi-sector Advisor (SMA) to provide a management 都urge capability to help deal with peak periods of SO management need at minimum cost.

<DESC>The U.S. Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) seeks sources capable of providing a computer network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Security Information Management System (SIMS) to integrate and improve our Enterprise Security System architecture.  Proposed solutions should address the following:   Objective.  To provide a centralized, real-time, auto-notification and active-response Enterprise Security System.  The vendor will demonstrate the capability to provide both an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and a Security Information Management System (SIMS) console as components of the Enterprise Security System.  The system must provide for secure collection, analysis and storage of raw logs, analyzed data (meta-data) and reports that will allow their admission as legal evidence in a court of law and meet established chain of custody procedures.  I.  Security Information Management System (SIMS) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) requirements:  a. Provide centralized monitoring and control of security tools.  It must securely integrate, normalize and analyze security event data from multiple sources; firewalls, intrusion detections systems, internetworking devices (routers, switches), anti-virus, servers, workstations and other network devices that are capable of providing security data.  The Enterprise Security System should operate using either the Microsoft Windows 2000 or Cisco operating systems.  The ability to integrate and work with an IBM OS/390 mainframe environment is desirable, but not a requirement.  b.

The master SIMS console should allow for remote management of the SIMS and allow the Enterprise Security Staff to create and manage customized SIMS remote management consoles for the use of technical support staff (WAN Engineer, Firewall Administrator, Anti-virus Administrator, System Administrator, etc.) and management staff (status and reporting).  e. The security policy module should create customized security policies for users, groups and devices.  The policies should provide the event type, event description, alert threshold setting, alert notification method and active-response action choices.  The policies should be hierarchical, allowing for automatic inheritance of higher level policies and individual policy customization.  f. The SIMS/IDS appliance/application/agents should be secure and hardened from attack.  It must ensure that intruders cannot compromise the Enterprise Security System environment. Only minimal device maintenance (i.e. security patch management) is required.  The vendor must provide explicit information allowing the RRB to understand that the system is compatible in a Windows/Cisco TCP/IP environment.  Describe what technical skills will be required to operate, maintain, and support the system.  g. Provide Network-based Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) allowing for supplemental Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) as needed.  h. Monitor up to gigabyte speed network traffic.  i. Must not degrade current network bandwidth and capability.  j. The vendor must provide specific minimum and recommended operational hardware/operating system/application information/requirements.  k. The vendor must provide technical information on how the system is hardened and operates. Comparison/independent testing results against similar products is highly desirable, but not required.  l. Product documentation and initial and follow-up/refresher training on the proper installation, configuration, operation and maintenance of the product for key system operators is required as part of the package.  m. The vendor must provide information on their standard and enhanced remote and on-site packages and pricing.  n. The vendor must allow for a limited duration product evaluation and testing period at no expense or obligation to the government.  II. RFI Submission Requirements.  a. Potential vendors should respond with detailed data including, technical literature, pricing details and information describing the degree to which they can comply with the requirements outlined above.  Anticipated additional equipment and material purchases should be discussed.  b. Due to the nature of this notice, a question and answer period shall not be entertained.

Responses to this notice must be submitted within 30 calendar days from the date of publication of this notice.  d. No telephone calls will be accepted.  e. The RRB does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request or to pay for information solicited.  f. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS OR BIDS.  g. The RRB will not transmit acknowledgement of receipt of vendor submissions and will not return any written data or solutions submitted to this office.  III. A current operational summary of the Railroad Retirement Board network follows.  Current RRB Operational Network Summary:  1.

2.	JOB DESCRIPTION:

A.	BACKGROUND

USAID/CAR Background: Central Asia Borders Russia, China, Iran and Afghanistan.  Due to its location amidst these neighbors and its substantial oil and gas reserves, Central Asia is a region of considerable geopolitical and strategic interest to the United States.  With a total population of 55 million and dozens of ethnic groups the five new nations of the region are emerging from isolation and almost two centuries of Russian domination. A recent civil war, threats of religious extremism, ethnic rivalries, authoritarian governments, and lack of viable institutions makes Central Asia a particular challenge for USAID.  The region is considered a Foreign Service hardship post  20% post differential for Almaty, Kazakhstan.

USAID/CAR is responsible, in close consultation with the five U.S. ambassadors in the region, for the design, development and management of assistance programs in five republics.  The central office is located in Almaty, Kazakhstan with offices in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; Bishkek and Osh, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan; and Dushanbe, Tajikistan.  USAID is one of the Agency痴 largest Missions responsible for approximately $100 million of assistance annually, with activities in the areas of energy and water, economics and finance, democracy and media, and health and humanitarian assistance.  Mission works in partnership with over 80 grantee and contractor teams.  USAID/CAR痴 assistance seeks to mitigate conflict and expand opportunities for participation, livelihood and quality of life for the citizens of the Central Asian Republics.  Staff frequently travels to each of the five countries to manage and monitor development assistance.  

Within USAID/CAR Almaty, the Office of Energy and Water (EW) has the primary responsibility for all energy (oil, gas, electric power) and water resources, including water activities related to agriculture.  The office also serves as USAID/CAR痴 contact point for various agricultural activities including the Agency-funded Farmer to Farmer Program, a centrally-funded Collaborative Research Support Program (CRSP) in support of Livestock, and activities with the Israeli International Development Agency (MASHAV).  Additionally, the Mission痴 Environmental Officer is located in the EW Office.  EW is the primary USAID/CAR point of communication and coordination for all energy and water development areas with the governments of the five Central Asian republics, the respective U.S. Embassies, local and international NGOs, other local donors, and private commercial entities.  

Recognizing the importance of the natural resource base of the Central Asia region in fostering the emergence of a competitive, market-oriented economy, USAID/CAR established a strategic objective (SO) to introduce the integrated management of natural resources in the region. Specifically, SO 1.6 的mproved management of critical natural resources, including energy covers the FY2000 to FY2005 period.  Success under this SO, as defined in the USAID/CAR strategic plan, is 都uccessful models of integrated resource management adopted and applied.  Strategy components consist of: a) broad training in environmental and natural resource management, including the development of pilot demonstrations; b) improved policy and regulatory framework; and, c) the establishment of a greater awareness of environmental and natural resource issues among the public.  

Substantial levels of increased development funding for USAID/CAR has been mandated for expanded water-related activities.  These are being carried out primarily in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, and centers on upgrading irrigation and drainage systems and infrastructure at various levels in the distribution system, including the farm level.  They also include a limited municipal/potable water project in the Karakalpakstan region. Another important activity is a transboundary water and energy cooperation project that focuses on regional issues of the Aral Sea Basin. Implementation of these activities is being carried out through the existing Natural Resource Management Project (NRMP) mechanism.

<DESC>NA The Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Industrial Policy, ODUSD(IP), Industrial Base Transformation Directorate (IBT) is the analytical focal point for industrial base competitiveness and financial health issues of interest to the Departme nt of Defense (DoD).  A primary responsibility of IBT is to participate in DoD policy development and decisions regarding mergers, acquisitions, and other corporate relationships between defense suppliers, particularly as they have substantial impact on th e overall structure, competition and technological innovation of the defense industry at all levels of the supply chain.  	To support this responsibility, IBT seeks expert contractor support to help assess the financial dimensions of select corporate mergers and acquisitions within the defense industry.  The contractor will perform assessments working closely with IBT staff, addressing both the financial health of the target firm as an ongoing concern, and the effect of the acquisition on the financial condition of the buyer, in the context of the broader defense market.   As such, to be considered qualified, contractors must first demonstrate they have relevant experience and past performance accomplishing sophisticated financial analysis.  Further, contractors must show that key personnel have sufficient credentials, to in clude education and experience specific to financial analysis and the defense industry.  Finally, since the work will involve working closely with IBT staff, often with very tight timelines to complete analysis for integration into broader assessments, the  contractor must demonstrate a capacity to handle multiple and simultaneous analyses, with start-to-finish durations of 2 weeks or less.

<DESC>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS (SSS).  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  This SSS is being issued to conduct market research and does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP) or an Invitation for Bids (IFB), nor does its issuance restrict the Government as to its ultimate acquisition approach. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this notice, nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Hanscom Air Force Base, MA 01731, is seeking potential sources capable of providing a product Tailoring and Warfighter Applications (PTWA) 2010 Capability for the US Air Force (USAF) and US Army (USA).  The Government is seeking prime contract offeror information at this time.  The Government expects to award a single contract with an estimated dollar value of approximately $125 million incrementally funded over a five (5) year time period. The objective of this acquisition is to employ evolutionary acquisition concepts to deliver a scalable hardware (HW) and software (SW) system to meet Government needs for weather forecast generation, meteorological watch, and observation management, with increased accuracy and decreased latency. This effort will ultimately extend, consolidate, and/or replace the following existing systems: Operational Weather Squadron (OWS) Product System Phase II (OPS II), the New-Tactical Forecast System (N-TFS), the Joint Weather Impacts System (JWIS), the Integrated Meteorological System (IMETS) weather/weather effects at the tactical Army Level, and may expand to include other weather related systems. Increment 1 of the acquisition, estimated to be fielded in June 2005, is intended to provide initial capabilities based upon current systems capabilities and operational requirements (to include IMETS weather/weather effects), aiming towards the consolidation of systems. Increment 1 will provide a single, standardized human-machine interface (HMI) that improves efficiency and reduces training requirements at all levels.  Increment 1 will also address Network-Centric Enterprise Services (NCES)/Defense Information Intiative Common Operating Environment (DII-COE) compliance, as well as interoperability with the Joint Mission Planning Systems (JMPS), Global Command and Control Systms (GCCS), Theater Battle Management Core Systems (TBMCS), Distributed Common Ground Station (DCGS) and the Army's Battle Command System (ABCS). The PTWA capability will be based upon the currently approved Operational Requirements Documents (ORD) and Operational Architecture, but must be adaptable to refined operational requirements, roles, and responsibilities based on the re-engineered Air Force Weather Weapon System (AFWWS) architecture.  The technical framework and design will be consistent and compliant with USAF C2 Enterprise Reference Architecture (C2ERA).  The C2ERA's object-oriented, component-based, open-standards architecture will provide the consistent, standards-based framework for development, modernization, and migration of combat operations and combat support systems. PTWA 2010 must be: (1) certifiable as secure and networthy IAW applicable policies and guidelines; (2) interoperable with existing and future Joint, USAF and Army Command and Control (C2) systems providing meteorological information; (3) tailorable to USAF and Army C2 mission needs and operational environments; (4) capable of receiving, manipulating and re-transmitting relevant mission information; (5) intuitive, utilizing a single standardized human-machine interface (HMI) across all three levels of operational weather support (strategic center, operational weather squadrons, and combat weather teams), enabling a single, integrated system to be used by all weather forecasters at every level of AFW operations in support of USAF and Army weather; (6) structured to exploit the economic benefits from using existing and Government Off-The-Shelf/Commercial Off-The Shelf (GOTS/COTS) hardware/software products; (7) structured not to degrade current manpower and dedicated support requirements; (8) planned to reduce the existing complexity and cost associated with operating and maintaining multiple systems; and (9) able to provide maintenance/sustainment support for those Combat Weather Team (CWT) and OWS capabilities not included in Increment 1. Qualified Source Requirements Offerors must provide a qualification package of past work that specifically addresses the characteristics listed above, but must also demonstrate ability to specify, design, document, develop, produce, integrate, install and test complex hardware and software systems and interfaces.  Offerors should also demonstrate the ability to provide the training and documentation, as well as the ability to transition, migrate, field, maintain and support these (or similar) systems on a global basis (approximately 500 sites).  Possession of current Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model (CMM) Level 3 (or higher) certification, independently assessed against the SEI CMM or equivalent model is required.  Offerors must possess, or have the ability to obtain, a classification clearance up to the US Secret level to support development within classified environments.  The offeror is also expected to have access to secure communication and storage capabilities.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division plans to negotiate with Indra Systems, Inc. on a sole source basis under authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements".   The contractor will be responsible for upgrading Device 2F150A located at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Cherry Point, North Carolina.  Key issues associated with this need are a simulator casualty report (CASREP) deficiency on the existing 2F150A, to have commonality with the 2F150C training device to support the fleet need of having two RNAWST trainers in Cherry Point, schedule, and cost.  The upgrade will include: replacement of the existing visual system that is compatible with the existing database on the 2F150C, a new real time input/output interface common to the 2F150C training device currently being developed by Indra Systems, Inc.  The upgrade will also include a new Instructor Operator Station and incorporate the Marine Corps Tactical Environment Network (TEN) in order to satisfy additional requirements outside the CASREP.    The total period of performance for this upgrade is 18 months with an estimated delivery date of January 2005.  A rough order of magnitude of the cost for this effort is $7.4M.  Currently, the Government does not own the rights for the technical data associated with Device 2F150C.

<SUBJECT>A -- NINDS Clinical Research Collaboration (CRC) Facility to Execute NINDS-Sponsored Clinical Trials
<SOLNBR>NS-03-006
<RESPDATE>030303
<CONTACT>Desiree Wheeler, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email dw76q@nih.gov - Desiree Wheeler, Contract Specialist, Phone 301 496-1813, Fax 301 402-4225, Email dw76q@nih.gov
<DESC>The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is considering issuing a contract for development of a Clinical Research Collaboration (CRC) Facility to assist with the efficient execution of clinical trials and other types of NINDS-sponsored clinical research.  NINDS is seeking input about the technical expertise required and available to create and operate an efficient CRC Facility, as well as input into its specific structure and design.

Background

Recent progress in neuroscience has led to an explosion in neurological treatments that require testing in randomized clinical trials to determine their efficacy and safety.  Conventional approaches to recruitment and follow-up of participants employed in recent NINDS-sponsored trials are slow and inefficient: a recruitment/follow-up infrastructure is developed de novo for individual trials, typically involving a limited number of academically-based neurologists, with recruitment lasting several years.  

The overall objective of the NINDS CRC Facility is to facilitate the efficient execution of NINDS-sponsored clinical research in order to test more treatments, more expeditiously.  Within the CRC Facility, hundreds of academic-based and practice-based neurologists will recruit and follow patients through access to multiple clinical trial protocols.  The CRC Facility will assist investigators holding NINDS grants with the execution of clinical research and with involving the broadest possible range of patients and physicians.  The CRC Facility will be a web-based network, distinctly different from traditional disease-specific investigator research networks.  The CRC Facility will serve as the switchboard to coordinate clinical research projects developed and funded by independent NINDS-supported investigators.  There will be multiple pathways to CRC Facility access, several levels of physician participation, the flexibility to adapt to the needs of specific research studies, and ongoing continuing medical education (CME) as a prominent component. 

The major aims of the CRC Facility are:

1. to expedite recruitment (achieving goals in months rather than   years).
2. to involve a wide spectrum of investigators, especially practicing physicians.      
3. to recruit a broad range of participants, particularly minorities.
4. to minimize the cost of the infrastructure, so that overall cost/participant are not increased.
5. to make participation in NINDS clinical research more accessible to patients.
6. to facilitate the transfer of research results to clinical practice, especially to  community settings.
7. to encourage large, streamlined trial designs, particularly relevant for studies of primary prevention of neurological diseases. 
8. to maintain quality by peer-review of competitive investigator-initiated studies.
9. to make study of ?small neurological diseases? economically feasible.
10. to engender a tradition of  participation in clinical research and of evidence-based therapeutics among neurologists.

These aims must be achieved while maintaining the highest ethical standards in human subject research, setting a benchmark for the entire neurology research community.

Further details about our ideas regarding the proposed CRC Facility are found in Appendix I, derived from input received at the NINDS Clinical Research Collaboration Workshop: Exploring the Options (October 7-8, 2002).  Appendix I can be obtained via email request to Desiree Wheeler, Contract Specialist, NINDS at dw76q@nih.gov.  Proposals for alternative structures to achieve the aims above are solicited as part of this RFI.

Information Requested

Information in the areas listed below will aid in the design of a solicitation to establish and operate a CRC Facility.  We request that interested organizations identify their technical expertise and resources, and capabilities and describe their availability to conduct such an endeavor. 

1.  Design and structure of the CRC Facility

i. What are the major essential components of the CRC Facility?  What expertise, capabilities, and levels of effort are required?
ii. How can continuing medical education (CME) be effectively integrated into the CRC Facility for training and investigator motivation?  What technical, medical, and other professional expertise is required to implement the CME?
iii. What steps (or phases) are necessary for initiation of the CRC Facility?  What is the proposed timeline?
iv. Given a perceived need for more information about motivation/barriers to CRC Facility participation by practicing neurologists, academic neurologists and patients with neurological diseases, if and how should focus group data be used to this end, and what resources would be required?
v. What scientific and technical resources are required to initiate a website to efficiently link eligible patients and physicians to NINDS-sponsored clinical research projects, including assess eligibility on-line?
vi. How can access to children, women and minority participants be assured?
vii. What would be the critical mass necessary to use, operate and maintain such a facility?

2. Subcontract Award and Management

CRC Facility research may involve hundreds of investigators funded through awards issued by the contractor as subcontracts.  Describe the personnel and database requirements associated with awarding and managing multiple subcontracts, including quality control procedures and research support services.

3. Program Management and Evaluation

Initiating the CRC Facility will be a complex and multifaceted process.  The contractor will additionally be required to evaluate the progress of the subcontracted research and of the efficiency of the CRC Facility.

i. Describe your experience with strategic planning and initiation of comparably complex projects.

ii. Describe the technical, medical, and clinical methodological expertise that you possess that is necessary for the design, operation and maintenance for the CRC Facility.

iii. Describe how you would evaluate the overall performance of the CRC Facility at each stage of its development.

iv. Describe your experience with meeting planning.

4. Personnel

Provide an assessment of the number and mix of personnel required to create and operate the CRC Facility and the approximate level of effort required, broken down by its major components.


This Request for Information is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation on the part of the Government.  The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of the responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or the Government?s use of such information. Respondents will not be notified of the Government?s evaluation of the information received.  Should a proposed solicitation materialize, no basis for claims against the Government shall arise as a result of a response to this request for information or the Government?s use of such information as either part of our evaluation process or in developing specifications for any subsequent requirement.  Responses will be held in a confidential manner.  Any proprietary information should be so indicated.

&#61623; Produce units that detect gamma radiation only
&#61623; Produce units that detect both gamma and neutron radiation simultaneously
&#61623; Apply unique markings specific to each unit (i.e. serial number)

Operating Requirements
&#61623; Integration time shall be no more than two (2) seconds
&#61623; Withstand temps between -22ｰF  and 122ｰF and 95% humidity at 95ｰF 
&#61623; Unaffected and operate correctly (shall not alarm) when subject to radio frequency electromagnetic fields up to 10 Volts/meter time-averaged field strength at frequencies from 20 MHz to 1 GHz.  The PRD shall be unaffected when in static magnetic fields of 1 mTesla  ( 10 gauss)
&#61623; The PRD electronics shall induce less noise than would result in one false alarm per day  (8-hour period) in a background field of 10 microrem/hour with an Alarm Threshold of 30 microrem/hour.  (Calibrated with 662 keV gamma photons.)  
&#61623; Detect gamma ray photons with energies as low as 45 keV  
&#61623; Detect neutrons with a range of energy between thermal energies (0.04 eV) and  1 MeV (when applicable)
&#61623; Sensitivity greater than 1.5 counts per second per microrem/hour calibrated for 662 keV gamma photons due to 137Cs 
&#61623; Neutron detection sensitivity of 0.5 counts/second per neutron/sec/cm2   

Logistics Support requirements
&#61623; Develop a support strategy
&#61623; Develop operator training
&#61623; Develop and document a certified Quality Assurance (QA) Program
&#61623; Develop an approved factory acceptance test plan
&#61623; Develop a program to track each unit through shipping and maintenance cycles 
&#61623; Deliver units with minute failure rates that are ready to use upon delivery

Because of the urgency and potential consequences, it is paramount that the technology be deployed as quickly as possible.  With that said, BCBP will require an expeditious delivery schedule that can provide large quantities, meeting the aforementioned requirements, within the timeframe of several months.  In addition, the quality of the PRD must leave them free from defect and allow for instant deployment upon reaching the delivery location. Lastly, because of current events, this deployment is and will be under the close scrutiny of Congress and the public.

<SUBJECT>59 -- Cable Insulation Resistance Measurement System
<DESC>Sandia National Laboratories has designed a cable insulation resistance measurement system to measure the effective electrical isolation between the individual conductors in a cable bundle and between those conductors and electrical ground.  This insulation resistance determination may be made in real-time during transient processes (e.g., cable fire tests) or be used to determine the present quality of electrical isolation for a cable under static conditions.  Also, with appropriate signal generating equipment, the electrical isolation of high frequency cables may be determined.
Features of the system design include:  automated operation once the test cable is connected and the control program is started; the data may be used to determine the insulation resistance between specific pairs of conductors in all combinations and permutations, and between a conductor and ground, providing a full-scope picture of conductor faults and modes; the technique may be easily extended to include cable-to-cable faults; data analysis is based on simple direct V=I*R type calculations; the system works with either AC or DC sources and the input voltage levels may be adjusted to match the normal operating conditions of the cable under test; and, a sweeping frequency generator may be used at the input to test/characterize cables used for high-frequency applications.
The system is scalable to monitor any number of conductors and does not require separate electrical measuring devices or instruments (e.g., voltmeters, ammeters, etc.) for each conductor of the cable under test. The method allows the use of modest power sources instead of requiring multiple or large capacity power supplies.
Sandia is seeking partnerships with industry in terms of commercializing this technology.
For further information please respond by mail or fax ( no phone calls, please) to Alane Dulski within 2 weeks at:  Sandia National Laboratories, MS 0115, P.O. Box 5800, Albuquerque, New Mexico  87185-0115, Fax: (505) 844-8011.  Please indicate the date and title of this notice, the markets in which you would like to apply the technology, and the type of partnering agreement(s) (more information can be found on the Sandia website) your company would be most interested in entering into.

<SUBJECT>66 -- BD Bactec MGIT 960 System
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award, on a sole source basis, a purchase order to Becton Dickerson located in Chicago, Il.  The purchase order is for the purpose of purchasing BD Bactec Mgit 960 System with included instrument starter kit and printer group.  This instrument is needed to replace the obsolete Bactec 460 instrument currently in use.  The 960 instrument will provide automatic readings eliminating the need for manual weekend readings and will eliminate the need for radioactive substrates required for the 460 instrument.  The authority for this sole source procurement is FAR part 6.302-1 in that Becton Dickerson is the only known source with the knowledge required to provide this instrument.  This is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation is available.  Firms that believe they can provide the required services are encouraged to identify themselves and give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the publication date of this synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<SUBJECT>A--TEAMING OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MISSION AND SCIENCE MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA RESEARCH ANNOUNCEMENT (NRA)
<DESC>Description: NASA Langley Research Center is seeking partners to develop proposals for the Mission and Science Measurement Technology - 2004 (MSMT-2004) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) Synopsis: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released a draft NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled, "Mission and Science Measurement Technology (MSMT) - 2004" (see http://research.hq.nasa.gov/code_r/open.cfm). The final NRA is due to be released shortly. The MSMT theme seeks proposals for exploratory research and technology development in the Enabling Concepts and Technologies Program (ECT), which defines new system concepts and develops new technologies to enable scientific measurements in support of the Aerospace Technology Enterprise mission.	The ECT program explores revolutionary aerospace systems, and performs fundamental research and development of high-payoff technologies.  ECT Program objectives are to identify, develop, and transfer breakthrough technologies that have broad potential across many types of systems to provide increased scientific return at lower cost, and to enable missions and capabilities beyond current horizons.  The ECT program is on the front end of the enabling technology pipeline that supplies the focused technology development programs of the NASA Enterprises.   This NRA solicits technologies in three major areas: 1)	 Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology; 2) Large Aperture Technology; and 3) Low Power Microelectronics Technology. (These technology areas can be viewed in greater detail via the NRA cite noted above.) The ECT program primarily focuses on early stage technologies at Technology Readiness Levels of between 1 and 3, unless otherwise noted in the NRA.  The technology requirements guide development of component and subsystem technologies, with emphasis on efficiency, miniaturization, integration, and resiliency.  The goal is to capture innovative ideas from the external community, to leverage emerging technologies, and to complement NASA capabilities in critical areas.  Successful proposals must outline a well-structured program (for up to three years) for development culminating in a proof-of-concept demonstration at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 3-4 by the end of the effort for both the Advanced Measurement and Detection Technology and Large Aperture Technology. (NOTE: The Low Power Microelectronics Technology synopsis requires that proposed activities have an entry TRL of 3 or 4 and that the activity demonstrate a minimum TRL 5 at the end of the proposed activity.) NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is seeking partners from other government agencies, industry, academia, and Federal Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDC) to participate with NASA LaRC Principal Investigators (PI) in the ECT Program to develop a proposal in response to the above NRA and execute development and performance demonstrations of components and subsystems. Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that selected proposal(s) would result in component and/or subsystem contract(s) for the selected partner(s). This partnering opportunity does not guarantee selection for award of any contracts, nor is it to be construed as a commitment by NASA to pay for the information solicited. It is expected that the partner(s) selected would provide (at no cost to NASA) conceptual designs, technical data, proposal input, project schedules and cost estimates consistent with the requirements of the NRA. Potential partners must demonstrate the capabilities and experience to provide components and subsystems consistent with the efforts synopsized for each intended LaRC proposal. Partners must work collaboratively with NASA and other potential government, industry and academic partners to perform the required tasks. Partner selection(s) will be made by LaRC based on the following criteria in the following order of importance: (1) Relevant experience, past performance, technical capability and availability of key personnel This criterion evaluates the proposers' relevant recent experience, past performance in similar development activities, technical capability to perform the development, and key personnel available to support the development. Substantive evidence (points of contact and telephone numbers) of successful participation in similar developments should be included. (2) Cost and schedule control This criterion evaluates the proposers' ability to control both cost and schedule. The proposer should provide evidence of successfully controlling cost and schedule for similar development programs and provide evidence of management processes in this area. (3) Facilities This criterion evaluates the proposers' facilities (development, testing, and analyses) to conduct the development or demonstration of the proposed task. The proposer should discuss facility availability, access, and the ability to meet the proposed objectives. Responses should be limited to 5 pages (12 point font) and address each of the criteria. A single proposal may be submitted to more than one instrument team.  All responses should be sent to: NASA Langley Research Center, Attn: William (Chris) Edwards, Mail Stop 469, Building 1208A, Room 106, Hampton, VA 23681. The preferred method of submission is via email to: william.c.edwards@nasa.gov. The due date for submission is COB July 17, 2003.  Technical questions should be directed to Dr. Marty G. Mlynczak, 757-864-5695, m.g.mlynczak@larc.nasa.gov Procurement questions should be directed to Mary Jane Yeager, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-2473, m.j.yeager@.nasa.gov or to Tom Weih, NASA LaRC Procurement Office, 757-864-3878, c.t.weih@larc.nasa.gov The following LaRC technology proposal is seeking partnerships.  Uncooled Infrared Detector Technologies: NASA Langley Research Center is actively planning and developing a variety of sensors to measure the Earth's radiation budget and climate, and the temperature, moisture, and chemical composition of the atmosphere from space based satellites. The Center also envisions developing instrumentation to image planets and moons and to conduct measurements of atmospheric composition and planetary climate within our solar system. These measurements will be made by a variety of instruments including but not limited to Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) instruments and advanced radiometers. Measurements of infrared emission from the planets and their atmospheres will be made as well as measurements by the techniques of solar and stellar occultation.  To achieve these goals NASA would like to develop advanced infrared detectors that operate at wavelengths longer than 15 micrometers, out to beyond 100 micrometers. These detectors would operate at temperatures achievable with conventional passive cooling in space and with cryogenic engines capable of cooling focal planes to temperatures between 10 Kelvin and 80 Kelvin.  The Center is therefore seeking partners with which to develop infrared detector technology to meet a variety of needs. Particular requirements include: ｷ  Spectral sensitivity: Wavelengths from 4 to 100 micrometers (mid-to-far-infrared)  ｷ  Optical modulation frequency: 100 to 2000 Hz, with emphasis on higher frequencies as required for imaging FTS instruments  ｷ  Noise Equivalent Delta Temperature: &lt; 200 milli-Kelvin for a 0.5 cm-1 spectral interval	ｷ  Specific Detectivity (D*): &gt; 1010 cm Hz1/2 W-1  The technologies solicited include (but are not necessarily limited to) individual detector elements and detector arrays (10 x 10 to larger than 500 x 500). Partners selected under this synopsis would participate in the development of a proposal to the anticipated NASA Mission Science and Measurement Technology - 2004 Research Announcement.

This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). The  BAA (Steps I and II) with evaluation criteria is listed at http://www.navair.navy.mil/business/ecommerce/index.cfm  (Business Opportunities/Open Solicitations). 

I. INTRODUCTION.  NAVAIR is soliciting proposals for research and development (R&D) concepts in sensor integration and communication technologies. Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology. 

II. BACKGROUND.  NAVAIR is working with various sponsoring agencies to advance the science and technology of sensor integration and testbed technologies. Future weapon systems will increasingly rely on the merging of sophisticated datasets collected from a myriad of collection sources. The promise of combining sensor data into a single integrated picture of the battlespace depends on key advances in sensor data networking and integration architecture. Developmental and operational testbed activities focused on these systems architectures systems must be adaptable to accommodate the most recent technological advances in both sensors and weapons systems. The overall program objectives are: (A) to explore new concepts in both sensor integration and testbed design and applications architectures, (B) invest in key technologies and create adaptations to better suit the needs of the war-fighting community, (C) certify the sustainability and safety of candidate systems, and (D) promote those systems through the procurement process. The size, weight, and cost of the sensor system or sensor network are of particular concern.  Historically, awards have been in the area of one-to-two million dollars; however, this does not preclude awards of a lower or higher dollar value.

III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST.   Proposals are being solicited in three areas:

A.	New Operational Concepts for integration of sensors with aircraft and weapons, both unmanned and manned. New approaches and applications for integrated sensors. New testbed architectures for supporting advanced weapon system concepts. Concepts should address possible ways to deploy and operate systems from Naval Aircraft or from sea-based platforms. Examples of the type of concepts that could be proposed are:  

1.	Sensor integration concepts such as reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition (RSTA) cloud concepts with multiple, smart, or computational sensors operating collaboratively to create seamless view of the battle space.
2.	Real-time sensor data networking concepts involving high-speed nodes and an instantaneous view of critical battle space information.
3.	Concepts involving  rapidly deployable sensor networks.
4.	New command and control (C2) concepts for managing sensor, and time sensitive, multi-INT data sources for operators and platforms on the move.
5.	Concepts involving new approaches to conducting integrated testing of future weapons systems utilizing advanced sensor inputs.
6.	Large area concepts where low-power, deeply deployed sensors communicate over large areas or relay data to an airborne, shipboard control station, or land-based hub.
7.	Virtual test range concepts employing sensors integrated with simulated activities to provide realistic environmental data.
8.	Sensor networking or testbed concepts that have dual use applications including counter terrorism, homeland security, force protection, and humanitarian and disaster relief.

B. Technologies that advance the state-of-the-art in performance and suitability of theatre-wide or tactical sensor networks.

1.	Multi-mode integrated electronics technologies that combine distributed sensor components to form a combined data output.
2.	Advanced communications and networking component technologies that offer significant improvement beyond the state-of-the-art either for aircraft platforms or C2 links.
3.	Advanced weapons technologies with sophisticated on-board processing for complex or alternative forms of sensor data input.
4.	Innovative tools, encryption devices, and networking algorithms for instantaneous remote sensor integration.
5.	Ultra-wide-band or other geolocation sensor network technologies. 
6.	Advanced sensor technology offering improved size, weight, or performance features such as intelligent data collection and conditioning, larger field of regard or instantaneous signal bandwidth.
7.	Technologies that enable the fabrication of advanced sensor devices and integrated assemblies.
8.	Advanced components and subassemblies that enable significant improvements to naval aviation and other defense systems.
9.	Software or intelligent agent constructs that augment sensor data processing for improvements in sensor data accuracy and reporting.
10.	Small, ruggedized packaging concepts for processing, routers, data servers, and other components for fiber optic, optical and wireless RF communication and relay nodes.

C.	 Systems Integration and Demonstration Testing

1.	Testbed demonstration activities utilizing state-of-the-art sensors in collaborative mode.
2.	Networking and data link system demonstrations for transmittal of imagery and multiplexed sensor data.  New approaches for high-bandwidth, multiplexed, digital, LPI/LPD links as well as approaches for network management.
3.	Fires and targeting demonstrations utilizing sensor networks or relays from a sensor network to transient platform such as UAV, a weapon, or group of loitering munitions.
4.	 Applications that address issues of autonomous or semi-autonomous, advanced weapons seeker requirements.
5.	Test activities for high energy weapons or weapons requiring increased target dwell time and utilizing networked command, control and diagnostic sensing.
6.	RSTA demonstrations to provide complete instantaneous awareness of a battlespace and communication of information to battlespace components.
7.	Mobile sensors and sensor grid demonstrations that provide real-time sensing and communication of a tactical perimeter.
8.	C2 on the move applications including Ship-to-Objective Maneuver demonstrations or those linking sensor integration systems to Expeditionary Strike Group missions.
9.	Urban warfare applications utilizing unique deployment, C4I and sensor control schemes.
10.	Dual use test and demonstration activities addressing needs for homeland defense, counter terrorism, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.


IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE.  NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371 and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research; or, by contacting Sue R. Wainwright at (301) 757-9746,  e-mail:  wainwrightSR@navair.navy.mil.  Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.

NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition In Contracting Act.

<DESC>Request for Proposals
Commercial News USA

SECTION 1:  SUMMARY/BACKGROUND

This Request for Proposals (RFP) seeks proposals from contractors to be implemented at NO-COST to the U.S. Government, to implement the online and print export promotion products described below. 

Contractors are to be paid their costs and a reasonable profit out of program revenue generated.

The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service ("US&FCS" or "Commercial Service"), part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, International Trade Administration (ITA), operates over 100 domestic Export Assistance Centers (EACs), and approximately 175 Commercial Posts in 78 countries overseas. US&FCS is statutorily mandated to promote U.S. exports by providing export promotion and facilitation services, products and programs to small-to-medium-sized U.S. business enterprises (SMEs).  US&FCS Commercial Officers and Specialists in our overseas posts, and Trade Specialists in our EACs in the United States, counsel U.S. firms, offer strategic export planning expertise, assist with trade event participation, and develop and deliver market intelligence and trade data on a cost-recovery fee basis. 

US&FCS services designed to assist SMEs and relevant to this solicitation include the following two periodicals:

Commercial News USA (CNUSA) is a monthly magazine that promotes U.S. exports around the world to buyers, distributors, and representatives in more than 145 countries.  This widely-read publication is currently distributed outside the United States, free of charge to foreign importers and businesses through U.S. Embassies, Consulates, and trading partners worldwide.  The magazine has been published for more than 20 years and has a companion Web site - www.cnewsusa.com.  The contract between US&FCS and the current private sector publisher of CNUSA will expire on September 30, 2003.  US&FCS seeks at this juncture to produce the CNUSA magazine and discontinue the www.cnewsusa.com website.  The contract resulting from this RFP may be extended by amendment to include the marketing of BuyUSA.com at a date yet to be determined.  

BuyUSA.com is a Government-to-Business (G2B) website intended to assist U.S. SMEs in the location of qualified international buyers and trading partners.  In the near future, the site will offer to users the ability to create a product/service brochure or catalog, interactive connection to promising trading partners, and a variety of educational information and guidance on conduct of international business.  BuyUSA.com membership is available to U.S. exporters under a tiered system.  Basic listings on the site are available for roughly $50 while enhanced listings will be available for a more significant fee. All fees will be determined on a cost-recovery basis.  

Qualified potential foreign buyers of U.S. exports are allowed to register free of charge, leading to robust foreign traffic on the site.  This is a major selling point in the eyes of potential U.S. companies. 

The BuyUSA service and program is specifically structured to integrate US&FCS and other internet-based service delivery with the unique global physical network of US&FCS field offices, offering BuyUSA.com users direct access to and assistance from experienced US&FCS Trade Specialists and Commercial Officers with expertise in all major industry sectors/subsectors, and in all major country and regional markets worldwide. The BuyUSA.com website is fully owned by US&FCS, and is located at http://www.BuyUSA.com.

US&FCS also owns BuyUSA.gov, a series of Web sites that showcase international trade service providers (e.g., freight forwarders, interpreters, local law firms) available to help U.S. companies' export to a specific country.  For example, BuyUSA.gov/Switzerland lists Swiss business service providers that can help U.S. exporters in the Swiss market.  BuyUSA.gov is linked to BuyUSA.com.

SECTION 2:  SCOPE, PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE

This solicitation seeks a contractor to produce and distribute the magazine.  Specifically, the contractor will be responsible for:
1)	selling listings and display ads to U.S. companies;
2)	copy writing and editing of listings; 
3)	camera copy production and making electronic version (.PDF) of the magazine available electronically; 
4)	printing;
5)	distribution; and 
6)	customer service.

At a later date, the contract resulting from this RFP may be amended to include the marketing of BuyUSA.com to U.S. exporters and international trade service providers.  Please note that the site maintenance for BuyUSA.com and BuyUSA.gov is handled through a separate, existing contract.

This solicitation seeks proposals as described above from U.S. firms that:
"	Currently produce and distribute a magazine or similar publication;
"	Currently market print advertisements in magazines;
"	Currently facilitate the buying, selling, or promoting U.S. goods and services; or 
"	Currently promote and/or facilitate the export of goods and services from the United States.

US&FCS is seeking business proposals from firms interested in providing contract services to US&FCS to structure and implement value added, print and internet based export promotion/facilitation tools to primarily benefit small- to medium-sized U.S. exporters.

US&FCS specifically does NOT seek to fund the activities covered by this RFP, but rather seeks proposals in which contractor produces and distributes the print version of CNUSA and recovers its costs and a reasonable profit from program revenue generated by these products.  Thus, services or capabilities are to be proposed at NO COST to US&FCS.  Respondents are encouraged to propose creative marketing strategies but are directed to review Office of Management and Budget circular A-25 regarding the government mandate for full cost recovery.  Generally, under Circular A-25, US&FCS must fully recover the costs of services it provides to identifiable recipients. We are open to creative partnering agreements with other groups that might be interested in promoting or distributing the magazine.

Proposals should, ideally, generate sufficient revenue to share between US&FCS and the contractor so that US&FCS recovers the costs it incurs related to the subject programs and the contractor recovers its costs and a reasonable profit.  

SECTION 3:  PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

Offerors shall propose a comprehensive marketing/sales strategy that ensures "critical mass" for CNUSA.  Specific duties include:

a.	Promotion - The contractor shall use its market research, budget, channels of distribution and schedules to develop and, with the cooperation of US&FCS field offices, implement a domestic promotional campaign for CNUSA.  We anticipate that the vast majority of advertising revenue will be generated by the contractor's sales staff.  

b.	Copy Writing - The contractor shall be responsible for writing and editing listings from materials it receives from qualified clients, ensuring that what is written, accurately describes the product or service in a manner that facilitates comprehension by potential overseas importers whose native language may be other than English.

c.	Production - The contractor shall, with US&FCS oversight, determine the cover design, editorial format, style and content, graphics, feature articles, etc., for CNUSA.  Also, using established DOC industry codes, the contractor shall determine the industry category of individual "listings" that shall appear in each issue.

d.	Layout - The contractor shall be responsible for producing the camera copy layout for the final printing of each issue.  The contractor shall publish individual "listings" promptly within a period not to exceed 45 days from any given issue's closing date.

e.	Printing - The contractor shall use its own resources and facilities, either in-house or on a subcontract basis, to print the appropriate number of copies up to 80,000, of CNUSA for each of the no less than six (6) issues that are to be published annually.  The current publication schedule includes 11 issues per year.

f.	Distribution - the contractor shall distribute appropriate quantities of each issue of CNUSA to all distributing posts and eligible domestic recipients in a timely manner.  The contractor shall be authorized and may at its option elect to use (a) its own resources and facilities, either in-house or on a subcontract basis, to distribute CNUSA; or (b) distribution methods currently offered by US&FCS and described below.  Regardless of the circulation for CNUSA, US&FCS shall receive, at no charge, no less than fifty (50) copies of each issue.

g.	The contractor shall make a .PDF version of the magazine available on BuyUSA.com and setting up an electronic email system to notify clients when each new issue is available.

Current Distribution is made by: (a) Diplomatic Pouch; (b) Military Postal Service (APO/FPO); and private sector vendor.  The current distribution charges are estimated at roughly $50,000 per issue for 120,000 copies, but please note that such charges may change.  Under this solicitation, we anticipate distributing significantly fewer e.g. approximately 50,000 -80,000 copies, and respondents are strongly encouraged to develop cost-saving strategies and partnership arrangements for the distribution of the print magazine.  Please note that simply providing the magazine in an electronic format is not currently an acceptable strategy for overseas distribution because many of our recipients are not Internet enabled.

The contractor shall notify the Department of all subcontractors, including printing and distribution subcontractors, providing services under this contract prior to the first issue of CNUSA that involves any subcontractor.  If the contractor elects to employ Department of Commerce distribution channels, the Department will provide the contractor with distribution invoices within eight weeks of the shipment date and the contractor shall reimburse the Department for all costs within 30 days of receiving the invoice.

The contractor shall, on a semi-annual basis, assess and report to US&FCS, the effectiveness of CNUSA.


SECTION 4:  DELIVERY SCHEDULE/DELIVERABLES

Contractor Deliverables
The contractor shall have its sales force operational within one month of contract signing.  The first issue of the magazine shall be published and distributed within 90 days of contract signing.

US&FCS Deliverables
US&FCS will, as relevant and appropriate, provide contractor with contact information for current online and print advertisers upon contract award.  US&FCS will also provide current marketing materials, training materials and other information deemed relevant to the program.

SECTION 5:  RELEVANT INFORMATION 

In order to assist firms considering or preparing a response to this solicitation, the following areas are of interest to US&FCS in its relationship with the contractor, with further details to be articulated in the ensuing contract.  
 
a)	Sales/Marketing:  Proposals should articulate an effective sales/marketing strategy to populate CNUSA.  Proposals should articulate how the contractor will generate enough revenue to ensure that the program is commercially viable.

b)	Cost Recovery:  US&FCS is required to charge sufficient costs for its services to recover its costs of developing and implementing said services.  Respondents should develop their own budgets regarding sales staffs, layout and printing costs, distribution, and other expenses.  Revenue sharing proposals should be developed by the bidder for print advertisements sold by the contractor and those sold by US&FCS personnel keeping in mind that current distribution cost of $50,000 per issue should be substantially cut and shall be borne entirely by the winning offeror.

c)	Applicability of USG Statutes, Policies and Audit/Review:  All project financial systems, operations and procedures shall comply with applicable Federal and U.S. Department of Commerce statutes (e.g. see US&FCS statute below), regulations, standards and policies, and shall be subject to Commerce and General Accounting Office audit.  US&FCS will perform quarterly review of the project's operations and revenues. 

d)	Pricing: US&FCS is statutorily mandated to focus on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Given the price sensitivity of SMEs, proposed prices for the project's services for 1/9 page ad must be agreed upon by US&FCS and the contractor to ensure that the prices are reasonable for the U.S. SME client base, while meeting the needs of both US&FCS and its contractors.

e)	Intellectual Property Provisions:  With respect to all content prepared by or for contractor under this Agreement, such as articles, collections of data, graphics, Web design, charts, and all other materials, the US&FCS will reserve the right to own, via assignment or otherwise, any works on which copyright is claimed by the contractor or its agent(s), ultimately resulting in copyright being owned by USFCS, to the extent permissible by law.

Property Rights: Although US&FCS and the contractor shall work jointly to produce the publication, it is understood that the name, title, and logotype of Commercial News USA, BuyUSA, and the U.S. & Foreign Commercial Service shall remain the property of the United States Government, as shall, in the case of logotypes, any reasonable resemblance thereto.  Similarly, the US&FCS will own all newly created domain names and trademarks arising under this Agreement.  Both parties recognize that the current Commercial News USA and BuyUSA client and/or subscriber mailing lists are, and shall continue to be, the property of the United States Government.  Any advertiser list developed exclusively by the contractor shall be the property of the contractor, but provided this or subsequent contracts are in effect, the contractor shall, on a monthly basis, provide US&FCS full access to such lists, at no charge to US&FCS, for US&FCS's own uses.

Liabilities:  US&FCS will require the contractor to maintain adequate insurance in the event of any disputes arising from use of CNUSA by customers. 

Confidentiality Agreement:  The contractor and its employees or other associates under this contract must be willing, if appropriate, to sign confidentiality agreements.

Additional Information

Contract Award and Implementation.  Selection will be made by US&FCS based on (1) assessment of offeror responses against criteria provided above; and (2) direct discussions between US&FCS and offerors addressing business programmatic, technical and business aspects of contract. 

(2) Any firm currently publishing a similar Department of Commerce publication or engaging in a similar export promotion activity (e.g. publication or on-line marketing) may be considered to have an organizational conflict of interest as defined by FAR 9.5 and if so would not be considered for this award. The winning firm may be not be eligible for future contracts or other arrangements with the Department of Commerce for similar publishing or export promotion activity that would create conflicts with this CNUSA
contract.  This prohibition would be in place so long as this contract for CNUSA is in effect.

SECTION 6:  PERIOD AND PLACE OF PERFORMANCE

The initial term of the resulting contract will be for a period of two (2) years with options for three (3) one-year periods based upon satisfactory performance.  The place of performance will be the contractor's place of business.

The Pop-up Archival Transmitting Tag must meet the following specifications:  
1)	Weigh 80 grams or less, excluding tether and attachment (to animal) material, and positively buoyant when released from tether; 
2)	Operational range in open ocean environment attached to moving animals to depths of 1000 m, temperatures of 0 to +40 deg C, and placed globally; 
3)	Lithium battery sufficient to sample data for one year and transmit at least 10,000 32 byte transmissions; 
4)	Capability to capture and store data collected every minute, or less, over at least a 9 month period; 
5)	>2Mbytes of non-volatile flash memory; detailed data are stored in archival tag and summary data are transmitted at release; transmission of summarized archival data in histograms: time-at depth, time-at-temperature, time at depth-temperature, and light level; duration of time summarized in histograms to be specified by user
6)	On-board real-time clock temperature-compensated to accurately time data readings and release date;
7)	Tag can be programmed to pop-off at a specified date or after a specified duration following deployment or as a result of meeting premature release criteria; 
8)	12-bit analog converters to provide high-accuracy depth and temperature readings; 
9)	Depth accuracy of 1% or better, measurable between 0-1000 m with a resolution of 0.5 m; -21 to 149.5 m is saved with resolution of 1 m; 150 m to 385.5m  is saved with resolution of 4 m; 386-705.5m is saved with resolution of 16m; depth correction tables verified; depth-temperature tables verified; depth automatically corrected for drifting
10)	Temperature accuracy of 1% or better, measurable from 0 to +40 deg. C with a resolution of 0.05C; -2.5 deg C to 47.45 deg C is saved with resolution of 0.2 deg C; internal temperature correction tables verified
11)	8-bit analog-to digital converter for light level and battery voltage readings;
12)	Light level measured as irradiance at a wavelength of 550nm, measurable from 5 X 10 -12 W.CM2 to 5X10-2 W. cm2 in logarithmic units; measured over the range of 0 to 255 LLU, with resolution = 1 LLU; light level correction tables verified; longitude accuracy up to 0.5 degrees; 
13)	Fully controllable and upgradable onboard software; all parameters are user-programmable;
14)	Attachment pin that breaks away with a static weight of 100#; 
15)	Quickly corrodible link to tether that releases the tag when either the user-programmed release date is reached or the pre-mature release criteria are met.


PRE-MATURE RELEASE FEATURES MUST INCLUDED: 
1)	RD-1500 to sever tether at depth of approximately 1550 m;  
2)	User-programmable software to release tag from tether (via corrodible link) when tag has been at a nearly constant depth over a period of time (programmable threshold duration up to 8 days) and with a variance set by the user and on option of no outliers; 
3)	Priority transmission of detailed data corresponding to the days prior to premature release of tag; (the number of days to be user-specified)    
4)	Transmission at pop-up to ARGOS satellite (at 0.5 W power with repetition rates of 54-66 seconds) of frequency tables of depth distribution and temperature distribution, depth-temperature profiles, light level and location data, and tag status data for each sampling interval specified by the user; priority of transmission of these data determined by user 
5)	Transmission to include checksum error testing; 
6)	User-controllable start up of tag without computer link, once the user has programmed the tag.  
7)	Epoxy, external labels containing the following information:  Sea Turtle Program, 75 Virginia Beach Dr., Miami, FL  33149, Tel:  1-800-437-3936.  

ADDITIONAL DESIRED FEATURES  (IN ORDER OF PRIORITY) 
1)	Power-saving feature to transmit only when the antenna is above water and ideally only in a broad window that would encompass the times when the ARGOS satellite was overhead; and 
2)	Detection of the tag out of water, triggering transmission
