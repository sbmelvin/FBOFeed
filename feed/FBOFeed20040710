<SUBJECT>B -- Study to evaluate effective vaccines against the virus that causes AIDS.
<SOLNBR>000HCK72-2004-11388

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), NCHSTP,DHAP, plans to conduct negotiations on a sole source basis with Caribbean Primate Research Center and Unit of  Comparative Medicine (CPRC, UPR), for a study that will further the efforts to evaluate effective vaccines against the virus that causes AIDS. 
BACKGROUND
Appropriate animal studies are a critical adjunct to the evaluations of HIV 1 vaccine strategies as an active prevention approach.  Evaluation of safety and immunologic responses to candidate vaccines are necessary assurances prior to Phase I human trials.  Furthermore, animal response profiles to different vaccine candidates and to immunization schedules can give important insight into the best candidate vaccine to move forward to human trials.  From an earlier completed project 2 vaccine candidate strategies based on naked DNA technology and a prime-boost regimen have been given to rhesus macaques and compared for elicited immune responses.  In addition, following mucosal challenges with live virus, we have documented protective effects of these vaccine strategies.  The current study proposal is a design for an additional 6-month monitoring period and virus re-challenges of these same vaccinated animals beginning at week 18 post their first virus challenge.  This study design will allow for a more in-depth understanding of the vaccine-induced protective effects observed in these animals.

The proposed use of 18 animals incorporated into this design permits the evaluation of vaccinated animals (two groups of 8 vaccinees) along with naïve control animals (n=2).  Monitoring the course of immunologic responsiveness post-vaccination will include longitudinal specimen collections through 6 months for vaccine-induced T-cell responses, serologic responses, and hematologic changes (e.g., CD4 & CD8 T cells) indicative of an adverse response to vaccination.  In addition, monitoring the outcome after virus exposure will include longitudinal specimen collections through 6 months for virus levels in plasma (& possibly rectal wash specimens), provirus detection in PBMC, peripheral virus isolations, serologic responses, and hematologic changes (e.g., CD4 & CD8 T cells).  A study involving rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) is appropriate due to the susceptibility of this macaque species to a variety of human pathogens including HIV-like retroviruses
The complex nature of host responses and vaccine product expression and antigen presentation requires the use of live animals to address the research aims in this study.  In vitro studies have always preceded in vivo experiments to minimize the number of animals used in our research and the experimental approaches are designed to provide the best possible model for human retroviral infection.  Given the highly reproducible rate of retroviral infection among our experimental animals, the utility of such a system as an animal model for studies of vaccine efficacy is clear.  

All specimen collection procedures for this investigation will be performed by trained staff at an approved regional primate center.  Expert CDC staff will likely participate in a quality exchange of selected techniques used successfully here at CDC.


PURPOSE 
To monitor HIV vaccinated macaques that have been challenged with virus to explore lasting protective effects of the vaccination regimen.  To continue to maintain and monitor sixteen (18) adolescent macaque monkeys.  Knowledge gained from this study will be valuable for the formulation of vaccines against HIV-1 in humans.

OTHER REQUIREMENTS
Vendor authorizes CDC unrestricted use of this data.

MINIMUM VENDOR QUALIFICATIONS
Knowledge of laws, regulations, and guidelines pertaining to housing, maintaining, and conducting research involving rhesus macaques (both naïve & virus-infected) as evidenced by regional primate center designation.
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS AND WHY THESE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO FULFILL THE NEEDS OF CDC.
Reliability, knowledge and experience in housing, maintaining and conducting research involving rhesus macaques as evidenced by Regional Primate Center designation.  CDC, as a part of the federal scientific research establishment that is responsible for developing guidelines for the ethical care and use of animals in research, must uphold the highest possible standards in its use of animals in research studies and collaborate only with other scientists and institutions that are required to uphold the same high standards.  Therefore, the minimum requirement for a vendor for this work is that the vendor be designated a regional primate center.  This designation ensures that the facility meets government standards for the type and size of animal cages and housing conditions; the qualifications and training of veterinarians, research scientists, technicians, and animal handlers; the quality of the animal care and feeding; and the protection of the animals used in research procedures from unnecessary harm.  Government funded regional primate centers also require that research protocols involving animals are reviewed by an institutional animal care and use committee, which additionally insures careful and efficient use of animals in research protocols.
In addition, this project requires 18 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) due to the susceptibility of this macaque species to a variety of human pathogens including HIV-like retroviruses.  Previous HIV research experience is also required.
CPRC has specialized in the breeding, husbandry, and research use of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)  that can be traced back to 1938.  The susceptibility of this macaque species to a variety of human pathogens including HIV-like retroviruses, in this case, make it advantageous and the hallmark nonhuman primate to use for our outlined studies.  Thus, CPRC offers a highly valuable resource and much needed expertise in this area of CDC-sponsored research.  
CAPABILITIES REQUIREMENTS:Through this announcement, potential vendors must demonstrate their capabilities to provide the services specifically identified above. To be considered qualified, sources must submit a capabilities statement, which demonstrates in writing that they have the intricate knowledge of the data needs and programmatic demands of the project and possess the following expertise in: 1) housing and maintenance of Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaques) in accordance with federal regulations for research animal use and care. 2)
HIV research experience. 3) DNA and MVA vaccination using cloned products from HIV-1 subtype A/G strains. 4) administering intrarectal virus challenges to macaques with an inoculum containing SHIV162p. 5)monitoring animal health for symptoms of adverse reactions after virus challenges, as characterized by hemogram abnormalities, cachexia, loss of CD4+ T cells.
This expertise should be demonstrated through a combination of publications, track record of completed methodological projects, and invited presentations addressing these topics.  
Ability to collect, process, package and ship blood samples for overnight delivery in accordance with IATA regulations for in vitro virologic and immunologic evaluations
Ability to prepare reports reflecting the results of monitoring and testing.
Ability to perform virus challenges and evaluation of macaques within the timeframe specified in the statement of work.

<DESC>The Agency for Health Research and Quality  (DHHS), through the Program Support Center, intends to negotiate a sole-source award with the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, England .

Purpose:

 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has requested a cost-effectiveness analysis of disease-modifying biologics used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in the United States. Specifically, CMS is interested in the incremental cost-effectiveness of the self-administered immuno-modulating drugs etanercept, adalimumab, and anakinra which will be covered under a Medicare demonstration program mandated by Section 641 of the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act (MMA) – relative to that of physician-administered infliximab, which is currently covered under Medicare Part B.  An analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the demonstration project that extends coverage to these therapies is required under the MMA.  CMS is also interested in the cost-effectiveness of these disease-modifying drugs relative to conventional RA therapy.

The Technology Assessment Program provides scientific oversight for technology assessments, cost-effectiveness models and related studies that are produced through contracts with outside organizations. The costs of the contract are paid with funds transferred from CMS to AHRQ through an IAA. 

The Office of Research, Development and Information of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has asked AHRQ to provide a cost-effectiveness model of disease-modifying therapies for the treatment of RA. The final report provided under this contract will be used to inform the evaluation of the demonstration project that will pay for self-administered drugs and biologicals prescribed as replacements for drugs currently covered under Medicare Part B.   A Report to Congress that incorporates the results from this study will be completed by CMS staff and is due June 2006. 
Sheffield’s cost-effectiveness model is the only model of RA drugs that contains all of the drugs of interest and used state-of-the-art probabilistic sensitivity analyses where there are no current conflicts regarding the results of research.  


THE PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION ACTION IS FOR SUPPLIES OR
SERVICES FOR WHICH THE GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO SOLICIT AND		
NEGOTIATE WITH ONLY ONE SOURCE UNDER AUTHORITY OF FAR 13.106-1 
INTERESTED PERSONS MAY IDENTIFY THEIR INTEREST AND CAPABILITY TO
RESPOND TO THE REQUIREMENT OR SUBMIT PROPOSALS WITHIN 7 DAYS
AFTER THE DATE OF PUBLICATION OF THIS NOTICE.  A DETERMINATION BY
THE GOVERNMENT NOT TO COMPETE THIS PROPOSED SIMPLIFIED
ACQUISITION BASED UPON RESPONSES TO THIS NOTICE IS SOLELY WITHIN
THE DISCRETION OF THE GOVERNMENT.  INFORMATION RECEIVED WILL
NORMALLY BE CONSIDERED SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER TO CONDUCT A COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT.

<DESC>The United States Marshals Service/Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System (JPATS) intends to issue individual personal services Contract Guard purchase orders.  These purchase orders will be issued with a fixed hourly rate and a not to exceed total dollar value, and will be for the government fiscal year beginning 01 Oct 2004 and ending 30 September 2005.  The personal services purchase orders will be for on call, as needed, armed and unarmed guard services for the transportation of federal prisoners and illegal aliens/detainees on JPATS airlifts.  A fit for duty medical examination and drug test will be required prior to award at the prospective guard’s expense.  In addition, minimum experience, background investigation, and physical fitness requirements must be met.  The location for guard services is Alexandria, LA.  Guards will support hangar security, backend aircraft security, and the Federal Transfer Center (FTC).  Crews fly daily and guards must arrive at the site ready to perform.  There is minimal lead-time and missions can be cancelled at the last minute.  Guards will be responsible for assisting Aviation Enforcement Officers (AEO), Deputy United States Marshals (DUSM), Immigration and Naturalization Service Detention Enforcement Officers (INS/DEO) and Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Officers in the secure custody of any prisoner/alien/inmate from the time the detainee is accepted into the custody of JPATS and until the detainee is properly removed from the custody of JPATS.    "Secure custody" of a prisoner/alien/detainee means the guard can physically control the prisoner in the event of an attempted escape.    Guards may have to carry firearms and other tactical equipment in order to carry out their duties.    There is significant travel associated with this position.    It is possible that the guard will have to remain overnight in a location with little or no advance notification.    The guard  will be responsible for arranging overnight lodging when it occurs, but will be reimbursed for the travel expenses in accordance with the Government Travel Regulations.    Upon award, all guards must complete an approved, certified flight safety training program.  It is requested that interested offerors provide the Contracting Officer for an information package no later than 30 calendar days following publication of the notice in the FedBizOps.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  NO SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE.  Respondents to this notice may be requested to provide additional information/details based upon their initial submission.

The personal services purchase orders will be for on call, as needed, armed and unarmed guard services for the transportation of federal prisoners and illegal aliens/detainees on JPATS airlifts.  A fit for duty medical examination and drug test will be required prior to award at the prospective guard’s expense.  In addition, minimum experience, background investigation, and physical fitness requirements must be met.  The location for guard services is ST. CRIOX,US Virgin Islands .  Guards will support hangar security, backend aircraft security, and the Federal Transfer Center (FTC).  Crews fly daily and guards must arrive at the site ready to perform.  There is minimal lead-time and missions can be cancelled at the last minute.  Guards will be responsible for assisting Aviation Enforcement Officers (AEO), Deputy United States Marshals (DUSM), Immigration and Naturalization Service Detention Enforcement Officers (INS/DEO) and Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Officers in the secure custody of any prisoner/alien/inmate from the time the detainee is accepted into the custody of JPATS and until the detainee is properly removed from the custody of JPATS.    "Secure custody" of a prisoner/alien/detainee means the guard can physically control the prisoner in the event of an attempted escape.    Guards may have to carry firearms and other tactical equipment in order to carry out their duties.    There is significant travel associated with this position.    It is possible that the guard will have to remain overnight in a location with little or no advance notification.    The guard  will be responsible for arranging overnight lodging when it occurs, but will be reimbursed for the travel expenses in accordance with the Government Travel Regulations.    Upon award, all guards must complete an approved, certified flight safety training program.  It is requested that interested offerors provide the Contracting Officer for an information package no later than 30 calendar days following publication of the notice in the FedBizOps.  This notice is for informational purposes only.  NO SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE.  Respondents to this notice may be requested to provide additional information/details based upon their initial submission.
