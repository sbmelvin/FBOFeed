In order to obtain information from FedTeDS, you will first be required to register with CCR.  The Central Contractor Registration database is a part of the Business Partner Network, an e-gov initiative, and will be used to validate vendor identity.  Effective October, 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  You may access CCR at the following URL www.bpn.gov.    Once you have registered with CCR you will be required to register with FedTeDS.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.

<CONTACT>JERE SCOLA jere.scola@hanscom.af.mil
<DESC>The Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) is required to replace the AN/TPS-75 radar as the principal USAF long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aircraft and missiles in support of the Joint Forces Air Component Commander through the Ground Theater Air Control System.  The primary mission of the 3DELRR will be to provide long-range surveillance, control of aircraft, and theater ballistic missile detection. The 3DELRR will provide air controllers with a precise, real-time air picture of sufficient quality to conduct close control of individual aircraft under a wide range of environmental and operational conditions.  In the case of theater missile defense operations, the new radar will have the capability to detect, track, and disseminate target information to respective command and control nodes such as the USAF Control and Reporting Center to disseminate for warning and engagement.  Similarly, the joint targeting process will benefit from trajectory information provided by the 3DELRR, which will include launch and impact location.  The 3DELRR will correct current radar system shortfalls by providing the capability to detect and report highly maneuverable, small radar cross section targets as well as classify and determine the type of a non-cooperative aircraft.  It will also mitigate most of the sustainability and maintainability concerns which plague the current system.

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Station Support/Simplified Acquisition (SS/SA) Branch, on behalf of the National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) intends to solicit, negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive basis to the Department of Neurology under Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

<DESC>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) intends to do one-year bridge contract from PBGC01-CT-03-0667 with Morneau Sobeco of Montreal, QC, on as sole source basis.     Morneau Sobeco is currently providing the services to deliver mission-critical pension benefit calculations and valuations, plan administration support and Application Service Provider services.  PBGC is preparing to re-compete this requirement in Fiscal Year 2008.  This bridge contract would be from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008.  


In view of the provider's familiarity with the complexities and the modifications to their propritary software required by PBGC, extensive systems experience with PBGC's environment, and the time already spent in providing services under this contract, it is PBGC belief that it would be in our best interest for the current provider to continue services for a one-year period until a re-competition can be advertised.  

This is not a request for proposal.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>MTO Office-Wide BAA 07-18: Amendment No. 4

DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) No. 07-18, Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) Office-wide BAA is hereby amended to add Advanced Photonic Switch (APS) as an additional (first round) research topic area.  With the exception of the APS-specific guidance/requirements provided by this amendment, all DARPA BAA 07-18 guidance/requirements (through Amendment No. 3) shall remain unchanged.  

The Advanced Photonic Switch effort seeks to develop advanced, high performance on-chip photonic switching devices for communications networks.  It is envisioned that these switching devices will benefit low power, high bandwidth, low latency, photonic communications networks, thereby benefiting a broad array of U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) problems and the larger US National interest.

This amendment solicits inputs for on-chip photonic switching devices that are fabricated in a CMOS-compatible process and that maximize switching speed while simultaneously minimizing device power dissipation, transmission losses, area, and sensitivity to ambient temperature variations.  The basic building block 1x2 photonic switch can be a spectrally broad-band switch capable of simultaneously switching multiple, high bit-rate wavelength channels spanning, for example, the communications C-band near 1550 nm, or a wavelength-selective switch in the same spectral region.  DARPA MTO is especially interested in validated designs that can be scaled to complex MxN switches.   

In addition, DARPA MTO is interested in understanding the fundamental limits to the performance of such switches and in demonstrating switch performance approaching these fundamental limits, and also in exploring novel physical mechanisms that may extend these fundamental limits beyond our current understanding. 

Proposals of greatest interest will clearly define aggressive quantitative performance goals, for example, switching time < 1 ns, bit rate > 40 Gb/s, total power dissipation < 1 mW, area < 100 microns2, spectral bandwidth > 30 nm, and tolerance to thermal variations over plus/minus 10 C.  Component designs that achieve or exceed these goals are expected to optimize the overall performance of the photonic switch.  

Proposals must clearly define an aggressive timeline and milestones for fabricating the proposed photonic switches and experimentally validate specified performance goals.   The first phase of the effort should concentrate on demonstrating aggressive performance goals for the building block-switch that optimize the overall switch performance, and on a validated design for a complex, on-chip MxN switch for optical networks.  A period of performance of 18-months is expected for Phase 1 however, in accordance with the evaluation criteria, proposals with a more aggressive period of performance are encouraged.  An optional second phase demonstrating the complex MxN switch may also be proposed.  Proposals from individuals or small teams addressing these issues are encouraged.   Proposed research and development (R&D) should investigate innovative approaches that enable revolutionary advances in switching device physics, design and fabrication.  Specifically excluded is R&D that primarily results in incremental or evolutionary improvements to the existing state of practice.

Abstracts are not required or requested for this amendment.  To be considered for funding, full proposals must be submitted by 4:00 PM EST on January 10, 2008.
BAA07-18, Amendment No. 4 will remain open through 4:00 PM  EST on January 10, 2008 (45 days) to allow proposers to address the specific Advanced Photonic Switch (APS) topic area discussed herein.   Proposals responding to the APS topic area received after the 45 day period has expired may not be evaluated.

Dr. Jag Shah, Jag.Shah@darpa.mil, is the primary technical POC for this amendment.

<DESC>In review of Industry input to the earlier request for information (RFI) posted under this action, it has been determined that the current competitive acquisition will cover the design, implementation, installation, test and evaluation of Mode S Elementary and Enhanced Surveillance Testing Capability.  This will include ongoing technical support from the contractor during the five-year duration of the contract.  Requirements for 
Mode 5 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) and Next Generation (NexGen) CNS/ATM workstations will be addressed at a later time under separate acquisitions. Under the current acquisition for Mode S, the identifier is changed to Mode S Test and Evaluation Center (MSTEC).  The earlier ACTFAST identifier is not applicable as Mode S is a stand-alone system.  The Solicitation will be FA9302-07-R-0005 under this MSTEC requirement. The next FedBizOpps posting will be under the new solicitation number and identified as MSTEC.  An Aug 2007 posting will be the formal Request for Proposal (RFP).  Offerors will have thirty (30) calendar days to provide complete proposals.  It is anticipated it will be a best value source selection.  Further, that all evaluation factors other than price, when combined, will be significantly more important than price.  However, price will contribute substantially to the award decision.  The Government anticipates a ceiling price of no more than $5M under the Mode S acquisition with award of contract in Nov 2007.  A draft Statement of Work (SOW) and CDRLs that are specific to the Mode S requirements are part of this posting.  Industry is encouraged to provide any comments on the attached draft SOW and CDRLs.  Responses to the draft SOW and CDRLs will be addressed to joanne.eldredge@edwards.af.mil and are due no later than 4:00 PM (local time) on 06 Aug 2007.  Industry is reminded that all future postings to FedBizOpps will be under Mode S Test and Evaluation Center and Solicitation FA9302-07-R-0005.

<DESC>The US Forest Service is seeking sources for solicitation for butterfly autecology studies that will support the development of a management strategy.  

Project Area
The Spring Mountains National Recreation Area (SMNRA)includes a total of 316,000 acres and is located 30 miles northwest of Las Vegas, NV.

Project Summary and Goals
The U.S. Forest Service (FS) and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) work cooperatively under a Conservation Agreement (CA) to protect sensitive species on the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area.  Four of these species have been identified as priorities for conservation:  the Mt. Charleston blue butterfly (Icaricia shasta charlestonensis), Morand's checkerspot (Euphydryas anicia morandi), Spring Mountains acastus checkerspot (Chlosyne acastus robusta), and Spring Mountains dark blue butterfly (Euphilotes enoptes purpura).  There is a need to develop a sound management strategy for these four species.  In order to develop this management strategy it will be imperative to identify and fill key information gaps in our understanding of the following:

Key life history and habitat information for each of the four butterfly species;  

Population management needs and objectives for these four species;

Potential long-term threats and management prescriptions for these species.

General Project Schedule:

The U.S. Forest Service intends to post a Request for Proposals, (A seperate Pre-solicitation Notice will be published for that purpose),in the December 2007 - January 2008 time frame.  Currently, we are developing a list of firms interested in providing a proposal for these services.  

It is anticipated that a contractor would be selected in March of 2008, and that a work plan would be due from the selected contractor in April or May of 2008.  If the response to Sources Sought supports it, this procurement will be set-aside for other than large business.  If the market research fails to produce an adequate number of small businesses, then the procurement will be advertised for full and open competition.  The selected contractor will conduct studies for two consecutive field seasons.  (May - October of 2008 and 2009). 

Interested parties should reply to this sources sought inquiry and furnish the following information to the Contracting Officer:  

Qualifications of key personnel who would be utilized for these studies.  Include a CV, Resume, or other instrument for each key person and the company or firm as a whole, (if applicable), which demonstrates education, training, background and experience in these types of studies;

Contact Information for references on past projects;

Descriptions of past related projects completed (including location, species studied, purpose, methods, and summary of results)

Information packages should be sent to the Contracting Officer.  Please send in electronic format, via E-mail, if at all possible, otherwise mail to the address given below.  Electronic submissions should be made to sroehr@fs.fed.us.  Please let us know your business size, and any other applicable socioeconomic information about your company such as Disabled Veteran Owned, HubZone, 8(a), Small Disadvantaged business, Woman owned, etc..

<DESC>A.General Information

TRICARE Southwest Region, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in California announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Bathing System ? Single-Use, No-Rinse Wipes & Disposable Washcloths with a possible multi-vendor award.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

 The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; & Naval Hospital Lemoore.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil. 

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of RIA selection with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated RIA selection date is February 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The RIA selection will be determined utilizing best value/ trade off criteria.

Phone:  (619) 532-8517


D. Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities within the Southwest Region. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria.  Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed by the TPRB to determine acceptability.  After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.  The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTFs by 4:00 PM PST on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both.

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process. All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing offer should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume agreement for a two-year period with (3) three possible one-year option periods (not to exceed a total of 5 years).  Vendors that fail to offer an incentive discount from DAPA will be disqualified.

1. Technical Criteria Evaluation

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and which vendors are disqualified based on their responses to the technical/company criteria.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  The vendors who meet the technical/company criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process.
1)Vendors must provide Bathing System ? Single-Use, No-Rinse Wipes & Disposable Washcloths for adult, pediatric and neonatal patients.  At a minimum, the following items are required: (pre-moistened cloths in a sealable pack and rinse free shampoo & conditioner).

<SUBJECT>70 -- Rittal Server Racks
<DESC>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) plans to procure brand name Rittal server racks to support existing Rittal hardware infrastructure that is installed in its data center facilities.  This announcement is considered a brand name justification.  This is not a solicitation.  This acquisition will be conducted utilizing Part 13 of the FAR, Simplified Acquisition procedures, and the test program authorized in FAR subpart 13.5, and the Patent and Trademark Acquisition Guidelines (PTAG). This acquisition will be conducted utilizing existing USPTO's Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quanity (ID/IQ) contracts for Information Technology products, a small business set-aside.  Rittal server rack hardware is the USPTO's established standard based commercial product in accordance with the USPTO's Technical Reference Model (TRM), which defines a comprehensive set of information technology standards, services, interfaces, supporting data formats, and protocols.  It is essential that the USPTO acquire Rittal server racks for consistency and flexibility.  Currently, the USPTO has 170 installed Rittal server racks.  The Rittal racks are much more versatile because they will handle all manufacturer servers, including Dell, IBM, HP and SUN (x386 (Intel) as well as HP UNIX).  By using the Rittal racks, we are able to support all manufacturers and move servers within the data center as necessary to support operations without having to purchase manufacturer specific racks.  Rittal is the manufacturer for Dell, HP and some of the IBM racks but because these racks are built for a specific manufacturer, they are a higher cost.  Since Rittal is the supplier for the other server manufacturers as well as those mentioned above, we are actually able to purchase a better rack at a lower cost then buying manufacturer specific racks.  The need is to continue their use for continuity and for efficient use of replacement parts and spare parts.  These racks are for phase 2 of the Patent File Wrapper (PFW) project.

<SUBJECT>A -- TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY UltraSpec: Ultrahigh Energy-Resolution Gamma and Fast-Neutron Spectrometer
<DESC>TECHNOLOGY/BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY
UltraSpec: Ultrahigh Energy-Resolution Gamma and 
Fast-Neutron Spectrometer

Opportunity: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the Lawrence Livermore National Security (LLNS), LLC under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is offering the opportunity to license its technology UltraSpec: Ultrahigh Energy-Resolution Gamma and Fast-Neutron Spectrometer.

Background: As nuclear technology experiences a revival and more stringent requirements are placed on characterizing, storing, and safeguarding nuclear materials and facilities, improved analytical capabilities are becoming increasingly more important. The fast, simple, and reliable characterization of nuclear materials is important to determine the proper operation of processes, especially during re-processing of nuclear material, or to determine the composition of unknown materials in waste containers or orphan sources.

In addition, as the nation?s security environment continues to face new challenges, agencies anticipate possible scenarios that involve terrorist use of radioactive materials to fashion destructive devices targeted for civilians, structures, or national events. Identifying and distinguishing illicit from benign sources of radioactive materials quickly is critical for front-line law enforcement officers, airline and customs inspectors, and other individuals engaged in nuclear forensics and non-proliferation applications. UltraSpec can provide nuclear scientists and technicians, security officials and first responders an automated instrument with high precision capability for Gamma-and neutron analysis.

Description:  UltraSpec is a new analytical tool for examining nuclear materials non-destructively. UltraSpec is a high-energy resolution spectrometer that can be used to characterize and identify gamma-ray or neutron sources quickly. UltraSpec uses microcalorimetric techniques at very low temperatures in which an ultra-sensitive superconducting thermometer measures the energy of radiation from the increase in temperature upon absorption of a gamma ray or neutron. UltraSpec can be configured as either a gamma-ray or neutron spectrometer, depending on the choice of radiation absorber that is attached to the superconducting sensor. As a gamma-ray spectrometer, it provides energy resolution that is ten times better than conventional gamma-ray spectrometers based on high-purity germanium. Configured as a neutron detector, UltraSpec combines the high energy resolution and simple response function of time-of-flight spectrometers with the high efficiency of solid state devices. UltraSpec can be converted from Gamma spectrometer into neutron spectrometer by opening the instrument and changing the sensor inside.  To view a photo of the UltraSpec: Ultrahigh Energy-Resolution Gamma and Fast-Neutron Spectrometer, go to:
	https://ipo.llnl.gov/technology/profile/announcement/UltrahighEnergyResolutionGamma_FastNeutronSpectrometer.php
Advantages:

?	UltraSpec bridges the gap between mass spectrometers and germanium
gamma-ray detectors by offering a precision comparable with mass spectrometry at lower price, and ease of operation characteristic of gamma-ray spectroscopy. 

?	The instrument is automated and transportable, allowing security officials and other technicians with little training to rapidly characterize and identify dangerous or shielded radioactive materials. 

?	The instrument can increase precision of gamma-ray analysis by a factor of 10 over conventional gamma-ray spectrometers that use germanium detectors.

?	The increased precision that UltraSpec instruments offer allows analytical scientists, technicians, and security officials to identify minute differences in sample composition that reveal the sample?s origin, processing history, and intended use.

?	As a fast-neutron spectrometer, UltraSpec offers higher energy resolution and a simpler response function than conventional He-3 tubes, and higher efficiency than time-of-flight neutron spectrometers.

?	While, nuclear materials shielded inside heavy metals such as lead have reduced gamma-ray signals, neutrons would travel through the heavy metals in ways that would provide UltraSpec with a signature.


Potential Applications:  

?	UltraSpec can be used as a general analytical tool for high-precision nuclear analysis by ultra-high resolution Gamma-ray or fast-neutron spectroscopy.

?	UltraSpec can increase the precision of non-destructive isotope analysis, for example to determine composition, age, origin and intended use of nuclear material, to ensure the reliability of processes and the safety of stored nuclear material at nuclear processing and power plants, weapons stockpiles, and waste facilities, and to trace the sources of illicit nuclear materials.

?	UltraSpec can be used in non-destructive evaluation applications where gamma-ray spectrometry with conventional germanium detectors is already a routine technique.
 
?	UltraSpec fast-neutron spectrometers can determine the composition of nuclear materials through shielding, and it can identify the shielding materials or light-element inclusions from the associated spectral details.

<SUBJECT>A -- EXACTO Program Industry Day Announcement
<DESC>The EXACTO Program is an exploratory development program with the overall objective to develop a 50-caliber bullet capable of high accuracy at long distances against moving targets.  The EXACTO system will address the fundamental limitation of accuracy, i.e. the uncontrolled vari-ability in the environment and the round.  

The EXACTO program goal is to develop a system consisting of two components:  1) a guidance system that provides information to direct the projectile to the target regardless of environmental or target perturbations; and, 2) an actively-controlled 50-caliber projectile that uses this information for real-time directional flight control.  

The program's mission is to identify system architectures that are capable of potentially meeting this goal, to develop the underlying technologies required to accomplish both of these tasks and then to integrate these technologies into a system capable of performing the overall function.  The purpose of this program is the acquisition of all information and the development of all technologies necessary to realize this goal: the complete integration of these technologies into a demonstration system, and the use of this demonstration system to verify that all program quantitative goals have been met.

It is anticipated the program will be divided into three phases: 1) component development (actuation, control, guidance) including Monte Carlo hardware-in-the-loop simulation, risk reduction, and conceptual design, exiting with a Preliminary Design Review and an option for continuation task; 2) integration, prototype and technology demonstration phase to include initial packaging and system demonstrations, ending with a prototype technology demonstration;  3) critical design review, automated packaging demo and full system demonstration.

The initial dissemination of information on this initiative will be the EXACTO Program Industry Day on December 11, 2007.  The goals of this meeting are threefold: 1) to familiarize partici-pants with DARPA's interest in guided projectile technology, 2) to identify potential Offerors and promote understanding of the BAA proposal requirements, and 3) to promote discussion of synergistic capabilities among potential program participants.  It is our desire to facilitate the formation of strong teams and business relationships in order to develop comprehensive, quality responses to any potential DARPA solicitation.

The Industry Day will be held at 3811 N. Fairfax Drive, Ste 400, Arlington VA 22203.  This announcement serves as a pre-solicitation notice and is issued solely for information and program planning purposes.  The Industry Day does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals or proposal abstracts.

<SUBJECT>A -- Request for Information (RFI): DARPA ASIC Development
<DESC>The DARPA Information Exploitation Office (IXO) is requesting information from vendors capable of developing and fabricating Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) chips to support the development of an RF tracking device.  Based on the current design of this device, two separate ASIC chips are required: one digital and one analog.  While it is preferred that a vendor be capable of developing, designing, and fabricating both chips, DARPA reserves the right to consider vendors with the ability to only develop, design, and fabricate one type of ASIC.

A Government laboratory has performed the initial development and design work on these components and has used MOSIS and the IBM trusted foundry processes for limited fabrication of both digital and analog ASICs to demonstrate the basic functionality of these components.  The digital ASIC was fabricated using the 8RF process and 7HP was used for the analog ASIC.  However, DARPA is now interested in completing the development and design through a commercial source to support the ?commoditization? of these devices and to reduce the overall risks of large-scale manufacturing.

The analog ASIC contains the following basic components, in addition to related peripherals:  A low noise receiver of GPS signals; Analog-to-digital converter (ADC); Digital-to-analog converter (DAC); Two stage class E transmit amplifier that produces about 17dBm of output power in the S-band frequency range; Phase locked loops for both receiver and transmitter.

The digital ASIC contains the following basic components, in addition to related peripherals:  ;Specialized GPS signal processor implemented in VHDL code; ARM7TDMI CPU; Memory - 128kB OS RAM, 4kB ROM, 256kB scratch RAM; Memory controller; Binary waveform generator; Power conditioning circuits for both digital and analog ASIC.

Design information for both the digital and analog ASICs will be provided by the Government to vendors selected as the result of this RFI so that they may prepare proposals for the completion of the design and fabrication of these components.  DARPA plans to host a Workshop to familiarize selected vendors with the goals of this development effort at a date to be announced.  Attendance will be by invitation only based upon a technical review of white paper submissions, clearance capabilities and ITAR restrictions.

DARPA invites responses from all qualified vendors interested in participating in the Workshop for these components.  However, note that due to programmatic requirements, prospective vendors MUST have the following capabilities:

1.	All personnel involved in the chip design and layout of these components to have minimum DoD final SECRET clearances.
2.	Due to ITAR restrictions, all ASIC chip design and fabrication facilities are to be located within the continental United States.

Interested and qualified vendors should submit brief white papers to SN08-08@darpa.mil no later than 1400 EST, Tuesday, 11 December 2007.  These white papers should not exceed 6 pages, including figures and/or tables, and should summarize the capabilities of the vendor to perform the necessary development, design and fabrication tasks for the digital and analog ASICs.  Pages in excess of the 6-page maximum will not be read by the reviewers.  This summary should specifically address the selection criteria listed below.  If respondents plan to use another vendor for fabrication, this should be indicated and the credentials and experience of that vendor also to be provided in the white paper.

These white papers will be reviewed and selection for further consideration will be based on the following criteria:
1.	Demonstrated capabilities and experience in the fabrication of similar ASIC components within the past 3 years
2.	Applicability and version of available design tools and how these tools are used to design, predict and verify the performance of the ASICs as they pertain to the above listed features
3.	Fabrication facilities and experience with similar ASIC fabrication and how the respondent will process prototype fabrication runs of approximately 100 ASIC chips of each type, as well as large scale production runs of >1,000 ASIC chips of each type.
4.	Experience of likely lead personnel should the vendor be selected for further consideration


INSTRUCTIONS TO RESPONDERS

DARPA appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources. White papers should adhere to the following formatting and outline instructions:

1.	Format specifications include 12-point font, single spaced, single-sided, 8.5 by 11 inches paper, with 1-inch margins.

Program and agrees that his/her duties will be carried out in such a manner as to be fully commensurate with the responsibilities that this entails.

?	One large aperture solar simulator with four 575 watt metal halide lamps and four reflectors arranged in quadrature, designed to deliver on solar constant at a 1.0 meter distance without uniformity option, and with the approximate beam area.
?	3.5 degree x .07 degree solar subtense suitable for use in thermal vacuum chamber.
?	Lamp power supply must consume no more than 1300W average power at 230 Vac 50 Hz.
?	Cover glass attenuation of simulator irradiance must not exceed 79%.
?	Variations in intensity over illumination area must not exceed a factor of three between any two points within the illumination area.
?	Spectrum, when fit to a blackbody curve, must have a simuated temperature between 5600K and 6100K

The instructor shall present a neat appearance and be easily recognized as a contractor employee.  The instructor shall maintain control of the learning time so that the presentation of information and exercises remain organized and timely and that key points and course objectives are met, and breaks are provided within the overall course schedule.  The instructor shall also observe the effect of the instruction on the class, and as necessary, clarify, provide examples and if required amplify the course material to help correct problems and improve participants opportunity to learn.

Core Ideas. The contractor shall be comfortable and in general agreement with the following foundational ideas:
-	Innovation in all-source analysis can work along many vectors.  Information technology, organizational structure, socio-cultural dynamics, ergonomics, and various forms of cognitive enhancement can all compel profound and observable improvements in the process and quality of analytical content.
-	A return to fundamentals can provide insight and value.  Critical Thinking is a necessary, critical, core skill which should be understood and, ideally, mastered before any intelligence-specific analytical toolset is approached.
-	The definition of ?Critical Thinking? is lacking in consensus,  but at the minimum an operational definition would reflect the following cognitive actions: 

o	Creating. Generating new ideas, products, or ways of viewing things
Designing, constructing, planning, producing, inventing.
o	Evaluating. Justifying a decision or course of action
Checking, hypothesising, critiquing, experimenting, judging.
o	Analyzing.  Breaking information into parts to explore understandings and relationships. Comparing, organising, deconstructing, interrogating, finding.
o	Applying. Using information in another familiar situation. Implementing, carrying out, using, executing.
 
-	Recent scholarship has demonstrated that Argument Mapping, as a pedagogical technique, has driven improvement in critical thinking skills. 
-	All intelligence assessments have a bottom line.  Every bottom line is a judgment. Every judgment is a conclusion.   Facility in argument will improve facility in analysis.

Course Objectives.  The contractor instructor shall ensure course objectives are met. The key course objectives are:
-	Introduce Argument Mapping as a practical and useable method to improve 
            critical thinking skills and produce better intelligence analysis.
-	Introduce advanced Argument Mapping techniques and provide resources and trajectory for follow-on study
-	Develop mastery in the basic Argument Mapping lexicon, tools, and techniques
-	Provide classroom instruction and practical exercises to ensure mastery of argument construction (aggregation) and graphic display 
-	Provide classroom instruction and practical exercises to ensure mastery of argument deconstruction (disaggregation) and graphic display
-	Provide classroom instruction and practical exercises to ensure mastery of specified formal and informal logical fallacy identification. Critical fallacies to focus upon will be determined at later date.
-	Inspire students to continue practice and application of Argument Mapping in their work.
-	Introduce students to dynamics of hypothesis generation  in a ?chaotic? environment 
-	Demonstrate, through the use of metrics (tbd), the efficacy of Argument Mapping as the optimal approach to Critical Thinking training.

Compulsory Vendor Attributes.  The contractor shall retain instructors who reflect the following attributes and academic competencies:
-	 Staffed by PhD-level philosophers with specific background in formal and symbolic logic, Philosophy/History of Science, Epistemology, and Argument Mapping theory and practice (to include IT-enablement)

//The provisions at FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation _ Commercial Items applies to this solicitation. // Addendum to 52.212-2:

BASIS FOR CONTRACT AWARD: This is a competitive best value source selection  in which competing offerors? past and present performance history will be evaluated on a basis approximately equal to price and technical capability. By submission of its offer, the offeror accedes to all solicitation requirements, including terms and conditions, technical requirements, and will be determined technically acceptable.  All such offers shall be treated equally except for their prices, technical proposals, and performance records.  Offerrors must clearly identify any exception to the solicitation terms and consitions and provide complete accompanying rationale. The evaluation process shall proceed as follows:

A. Initially, the government technical evaluation team shall evaluate the technical  proposals on a pass/fail basis, assigning ratings of Acceptable, Reasonably Susceptible of Being Made Acceptable, or Unacceptable.  The proposals shall be evaluated against the following subfactors:

1.  Subfactor 1- The contractor has furnished a quality technical plan for execution, to include agenda down to hour-by-hour fidelity
2.  Subfactor II- The contractor has furnish material and information addressing compulsory contractor attributes

B. Using questionnaires, the contracting officer shall seek relevant performance information on (1) the past and present performance efforts provided by the offeror and (2) data independently obtained from other government and commercial sources.  The following ratings will be used in evaluating the relevancy of the offeror?s past performance:

(a) Very Relevant- Past performance effort within the last year on any contract providing the development and implementation for providing the development and implementation for critical thinking and argument mapping training services as outlined in the Statement of Work similar to or greater in scope , magnitude and complexity of this requirement to include Quality and Satisfaction Rating.  

(b) Relevant- Past performance effort within the three last (3) years on any DoD or commercial contract providing the development and implementation for providing the development and implementation for critical thinking and argument mapping training services as outlined in the Statement of Work similar to or greater in scope , magnitude and complexity of this requirement to include Quality and Satisfaction Rating.  

(c) Somewhat Relevant- Past performance effort within the last five (5) years on any commercial contract providing the development and implementation for critical thinking and argument mapping training services as outlined in the Statement of Work similar to or greater in scope , magnitude and complexity of this requirement to include Quality and Satisfaction Rating.  

(d) Not Relevant- N/R. No relevant experience.

The purpose of the past performance evaluation is to allow the government to assess the offeror?s ability to perform the effort described in this RFP, based on the offeror?s demonstrated present and past performance.  The assessment process will result in an overall performance confidence assessment of High Confidence, Significant Confidence, Satisfactory Confidence, Unknown Confidence, Little Confidence or No Confidence as defined in AFFARS Mandatory Procedures 5315.3, Table 3.  Relevant performance includes performance of efforts involving critical thinking and argument mapping as outlined in the Statement of Work that are similar or greater in scope, magnitude and complexity than the effort described in this solicitation.  The government reserves the right to seek information on higher priced offerors if none of the lower priced offerors receive a ?High Confidence? performance assessment rating.  Past performance regarding predecessor companies, key personnel who have relevant experience, or sub-contractors that will perform major or critical aspects of the requirement will not be considered as highly as past performance information for the principal offeror. Offerors with no relevant past or present performance history shall receive the rating ?Unknown Confidence?, meaning the rating is treated neither favorably nor unfavorably.

C.  In evaluating past performance, the government reserves the right to give greater consideration to information on those contracts deemed most relevant to the effort described in this solicitation.

D.  If the lowest priced evaluated offer is judged to have a ?High Confidence? performance rating, that offer represents the best value for the government and the evaluation process stops at this point. Award shall be made to that offeror without further consideration of any other offers.

E. In the event that the government does not make an award pursuant to paragraph D above, the government reserves the right to award a contract to other than the lowest priced offer if that offeror is judged to have a performance assessment rating of ?Significant Confidence? or lower.  In that event, the Source Selection Authority shall make an integrated assessment best value award decision.

F. Offerors are cautioned to submit sufficient information and in the format specified in the proposal preparation instructions. Offerors may be asked to clarify certain aspects of their proposal or respond to adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond.  Adverse past performance is defined as past performance information that supports a less than satisfactory rating on any evaluation element or any unfavorable comments received from sources without a formal rating system.  Communication conducted to resolve minor or clerical errors will not constitute discussions and the contracting officer reserves the right to award a contract without the opportunity for proposal revision.

G. The government intends to award a contract without discussions with respective offerors. The government, however, reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed in its best interest.
