Also required is the capability to generate CADD files and to convert files such as photos, publications, CAD drawings, and other types to non-editable files such as PDF files.</p>
<p>Work sites to include Altus AFB, OK (AAFB) which could include work at the Sooner Drop Zone (SDZ) located in Harmon County, OK; and at the Clinton-Sherman Airfield located in Burns Flat, Washita County, OK; or at Sheppard AFB, Wichita Falls, TX (SAFB) which could include work at Lake Texoma Recreational Annex located approximately 120 miles east of SAFB in Briar Creek Cove on Lake Texoma, Grayson County, Texas; and Frederick Auxiliary Air Field in Frederick, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Projects will vary by type, scope, and complexity, requiring the use of various and multiple facility design disciplines and related technical services. Services provided by the A-E will be primarily for execution of sustainment, restoration and modernization (SRM) type projects: construction of new whole buildings requiring all disciplines; minor construction (addition/remodel) and maintenance (repair/alteration) of existing real property requiring various combinations of disciplines; and/or support of government in-house designs and other Government IDIQ construction contracts requiring one or more disciplines. Design services provided within each engineering discipline shall be performed under the direct supervision of state licensed architects and engineers.</p>
<p>The government anticipates awarding two (2) A-E ID/IQ contracts. One contract will be awarded full and open, and the second contract will be awarded as small business set-aside. Contracts will be awarded to the most highly qualifed firms for capabilities required by the Government. Contracts will cover a one-year base ordering period with four (4) one-year option periods. Individual contracts will not exceed $2,500,000.00 for the entire contract period, including options. A minimum of $5,000.00 is guaranteed in the basic year. Services may be funded with either appropriated or non-appropriated funds.</p>
<p>Notice to Offerors: Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this synopsis until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this synopsis, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this synopsis, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs.</p>
<p>Design requirements will range from studies or charrettes, to 30% designs, to 100% complete designs. For less than 100% designs, emphasis will be on quick response. Most project construction budgets will range from $50,000.00 ($50k) to $750,000.00 ($750k).</p>
<p>Direct design fees have a statutory limitation of 6% of the construction budget.</p>
<p>The criteria for selection, in relative order of importance, and point values assigned to each criterion are as follows: <br />(1) Professional qualifications of the staff to be assigned to the project necessary for satisfactory performance of required services-30 points; <br />(2) Specialized experience and technical competence in the type of work required, including, where appropriate, experience in energy conservation, pollution prevention, waste reduction, and the use of recovered materials-20 points; <br />(3) Past performance on contracts with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules-18 points; <br />(4) Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time-12 points; <br />(5) Location in the general geographical area of the project (defined herein as location within a 300-mile radius of the key personnel of the prime A-E firm intended to support any resulting contract) and knowledge of the locality of the project; provided, that application of this criterion leaves an appropriate number of qualified firms, given the nature and size of the project-10 points; and <br />(6) Volume of work previously awarded to the firm by the Department of Defense (DOD) during the previous 12 months, with priority given to equitable distribution of DOD contracts. However, we will not reject the overall most highly qualified firm solely in the interest of equitable distribution of contracts-10 points.<br /><br />Each firm will indicate whether they want to be considered for the small business set-aside, the full and open award, or both. All firms will indicate selected consultants to include, but not limited to, the following design disciplines: Architectural (including landscape architects), Civil Engineer (general and airfield design), Structural, Mechanical (primarily HVAC and plumbing, fire protection required), Environmental (hazardous waste identification and design), and Electrical (building design, fire detection and alarm systems, exterior lighting, and underground distribution). Consultants, joint ventures, or complete in-house capability of the listed design disciplines is acceptable. <br /><br />Firms desiring consideration shall submit one (1) original and three (3) copies of their Standard Form (SF 330), Parts I and II"Architect-Engineer Qualification." Also, firms shall include one (1) CD containing their Standard Form 330 (SF 330), Parts I and II, "Architect-Engineer Qualification." <br /><br />Submit to:<br />97 CONS/LGCB <br />Attn: Lori Clinton<br />308 N 1st Street, Ste. 2301 <br />Altus AFB, OK 73523 <br /><br />no later than (COB (16:30 CST)&nbsp;3&nbsp;June 2013). <br /><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

<DESC>Exception is taken to this requirement FD2030-13-01635 of the synopsis publicizing IAW with FAR part 5.202(a)(13), exception:
(i)	 Is for an amount not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold
(ii)	Will be made through a means that provides access to the notice of proposed contract action through the GPE.
(iii)	Permits the public to respond to the solicitation electronically.
Electronic commerce is defined at 41 USC sec. 426 as electronic techniques for accomplishing business transactions, including electronic mail.  Thus, provided the complete solicitation package is available through the GPE and offerors are permitted to respond electronically (i.e., email in this case), the proposed contract action would not need to be synopsized.
Therefore, synopsis is hereby waived as this acquisition is not expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold, request for proposal will be made through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOps), and the offerors will be able to respond electronically.

Government First Articles may be required from newly approved sources. This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.

Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation, regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set aside, foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). 
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, in its solicitation for the described supplies or services. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.

Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. 
Note: While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. Award will be made only if the offeror, the product/service, or the manufacturer meets qualification requirements at the time of award in accordance with FAR clause 52.209-1. 
The solicitation identifies the office where additional information can be obtained concerning qualification requirements as cited in each individual solicitation. AWARD WILL NOT BE WITHHELD AWAITING QUALIFICATION. For qualification information/source approval requests contact OC-ALC/BC, 3001 Staff Drive, Ste #1AC85A, Tinker AFB, OK 73145-3009.

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command - New Jersey, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of PM Soldier Weapons, intends to solicit, negotiate and award a sole source contract to United Support Solutions, Inc. of Cedar Grove, NJ 07009-1240, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(g)(1)(A) as implemented by FAR 13.106-1(b)(1)(i).  The anticipated effort requires a delivery quantity of 10,000 M2 Link Guides for Common Remotely Operated Weapon Stations (CROWS).  This contract will be a one-time buy with an expected period of performance of three months from contract award.   The M2 Link Guide is a bent piece of sheet metal with black oxide finish that is to be built to a U.S. Government Technical Data Package.  This piece sits on the ejection side of the weapon on the Soft Mount Assembly of the M153 CROWS.  It has two chamfered through holes for mounting with flat screws to the soft mount.  This piece effectively guides disjointed links that are ejected from the receiver of the weapon away from the weapon and away from critical components such as the Sight Servo Assembly.  <br>  <br> The M2 Link Guide requires the engineering and design of a specialized set of stamp dies to produce the necessary bends to meet the drawing specifications.  The cost of designing and producing the dies necessary for this production is significant.  United Support Solutions has already designed and fabricated the dies required for this product under a previous contract.  United Support Solutions is the sole contractor possessing the ability to provide this item without introducing significant duplication of costs to the program.  The additional cost for another contractor to perform this task is not expected to be recovered through competition and is considered to be unacceptable. <br>  <br> Please note that this notice does not constitute a Request For Proposal (RFP).  A determination by the U.S. Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the U.S. Government.  The anticipated award timeframe for this action is 4QFY13. <br>

<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) National Training Center (NTC) located at 9828 North 31st Avenue Phoenix, AZ 85051 seeks qualified contractors to perform miscellaneous educational support services via Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPAs). There is no guarantee of any work coming from these BPAs. That is because they are being made to streamline the acquisition process should circumstances make their use necessary. The BPAs will be of one year duration. The BLM NTC intends to re-announce each year for each years renewal of the BPA program. If it turns out that a BPA holder is under a GSA contract for the service(s) in the BPA, the BLM NTC BPA is automatically converted to a GSA contract BPA and all prices are automatically converted to the GSA contract price(s). These services will be under PSC U009 Education Services; NAICS Code 611710 Educational Support Services. The line items indicate which services are needed. For the services that you are qualified for and willing to perform, put in the hourly rate that you will perform that service at. For the services that you are not qualified for and/or not willing to perform, do not put in an hourly rate to be charged.  Do not include travel costs in your hourly rate. Travel costs will be calculated around the time they are to be done. Travel costs are to be the market price of the airline ticket for coach class (BLM IM OC-2012-054 specifies that BLM employees must travel coach class and this sets the standard) except for travel by POV (Privately Owned Vehicle) which will be at the published federal government rate per mile (available from GSAs website), the published federal government rate for lodging in the particular city (available from GSAs website) and the published federal government per diem (lodging and M&IE) (available from GSAs website). In regards to hourly payment while traveling ex on Sunday a BPA holder is traveling to the location of performance  take the hourly rate of payment for traveling to be one-half the hourly rate of the service to be performed on the BPA. If made, a BPA call (task order on the BPA) to you will be for your lump sum (one line item) cost for performing the service plus travel costs. A cost breakdown sheet is required to show cost reasonableness of the lump sum. All contractors wishing to do business with the federal government must have a current entry in the SAM (System for Award Management, www.sam.gov). This procurement is a 100% set aside for small business. Direct all questions to Contract Specialist Pete Smolinski ((602) 906-5563;Psmolins@blm.gov).

<p>CAUTION NOTICE: CLAUSE 52.215-9023 REVERSE AUCTION (AUG 2011) DLAD is being included in the solicitation to permit the Contracting Officer to utilize this on-line reverse auctioning technique as a means of conducting price discussions if deemed advantageous to the government.

<p>CAUTION NOTICE -- TWO-PHASE TECHNICAL/PRICE EVALUATION <br />(AUG 2007) DSCP<br />The Government anticipates that numerous offerors will submit proposals on solicitation. In the event that eight or more proposals are received, the Government may use a two-phase evaluation process, which allows the Contracting Officer to conduct a preliminary evaluation of all offers, in order to determine which offers are the least likely to be candidates for further consideration. During this preliminary evaluation, all offerors' Product Demonstration Models (PDMs) and proposed prices will be evaluated. Certain offerors may be excluded from further consideration at this point, if their PDM ratings and/or offered prices are not competitive when compared with PDM ratings and prices proposed by other offerors. The remaining offers will then be evaluated for the remaining technical evaluation factors. After the completion of this review, the Contracting Officer will determine whether to establish a competitive range and enter into negotiations, or to award without discussions. This process is set forth in provision 52.215-9P23, Two-Phase Technical/Price Evaluation contained in solicitation.</p>

<DESC><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span>:<br />
<p><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</strong></p>
<p><br />The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute, (NHGRI), intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to Teryveyden JA Hyvinvoinnin Laitos, P.O. Box 30, Helsinki, Finland 00271 to generate primary fibroblast cell lines.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Procurement:</strong></span></p>
<p>1.	The Contractor shall generate primary fibroblast cell lines from 150 subjects in the FUSION study of "Type 2 Diabetes".</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></span>:</p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Genetic Technology Branch (GTB) Molecular Genetics Section is currently working on a generation of primary fibroblast cell lines project from Finnish subjects enrolled in NHGRI project: R01 DK062370-06A1: "Genetic analysis of type II diabetes in the Finnish population". This project has been developed over the past 16 years in collaboration with Teryveyden JA Hyvinvoinnin Laitos (THL) to discover the genetic basis of diabetes. THL clinical laboratory has existing IRB approval from Finland, phenotyping and DNA analysis of thousands of individuals living in Finland has been conducted.</p>
<p>The object of this procurement is a part of a research project identifying genes for type 2 diabetes: FUSION - R01 DK062370-06A1. To identify genes increasing susceptibility to type 2 diabetes and to fine map these loci to identify the predisposing variants. To achieve this goal, NHGRI will obtain biological specimens and phenotype information and examine the correlation of mRNA expression with genotype and phenotype in a subset of FUSION samples. Expression studies based on muscle and adipose samples from a select group of highly informative study subjects are likely to be critical in functional genomics efforts to identify the predisposing genetic variant(s). The purpose of this substudy is to establish fibroblast cell lines from the collected skin samples.</p>
<p>NHGRI require the cell lines from these specific subjects because they are part of a longitudinal study where the subjects are exact same persons for which NHGRI have an immense amount of medical history, genotype and phenotype information.  The required clinical laboratory Teryveyden JA Hyvinvoinnin Laitos is uniquely qualified for the biopsy of skin samples and the generation of primary fibroblast cell lines. An approved well tested protocol for the collection, processing and shipping of the samples to NHGRI for analysis has been established with THL</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE</strong></span></p>
<p><br />May 2013 through January 31, 2014</p>
<p><br /><strong>DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p>Delivery of cell lines will be within 4 Weeks of receiving approved purchase order.  All deliveries will be handled exclusively by TERVEYDEN JA HYVINVOINNIN LAITOS (THL)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>JUSTIFICATION</strong></span></p>
<p>TERVEYDEN JA HYVINVOINNIN LAITOS (THL) is the site for collection of the patient samples. THL is the only clinical laboratory approved under the IRB OH95-HG-N030 "Mapping Genes for Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus" for the contact and collection of samples from the Finnish Population.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REGULATORY AUTHORITY</strong></span></p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b) Soliciting from a single source, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</strong></span></p>
<p>Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541711, Research and Development in Biotechnology and the Small Business Size Standard is 500.  The acquisition is being conducted under FAR Part 13, simplified acquisition procedures, therefore the requirements of FAR Part 6 B Competitive Requirements are not applicable (FAR Part 6.001). The resultant Contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 05-66 (April 1, 2013). This requirement is under the SAT of $150,000.00.</p>
<p>The determination by the Government to award a purchase order on a sole source on competitive basis for generation of primary fibroblast cell lines from 150 Finnish Subjects is a continuation of a previous order [HHSN268201100398P, September 8, 2011] issued for this requirement. Any information received as a result of this pre-solicitation / notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct any future competitive procurements.  The determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses to this notice shall contain sufficient documentation to establish the interested parties' bona-fide capabilities for fulfilling the requirement.

<DESC>This is a Pre-Solicitation/Notice of Intent Synopsis for a sole source noncompetitive award to Life Technologies, Corporation, Carlsbad, CA for Preventative Maintenance Services for two Applied BioSystems Genetic Analyzers and one Applied BioSystems Sequence Detection System.<br /><br />The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), Office of Acquisitions (OA), on behalf of the DIR / Hematology Branch intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a sole source noncompetitive basis for preventative maintenance services for two Applied BioSystems Genetic Analyzers (S/N #1604-018 and S/N #1352-014) and one Applied BioSystems Sequence Detection System (S/N #200564) to Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA. (Note: during the last quarter of 2012, Applied Biosystems legally became Life Technologies). <br /><br />Investigators in the Hematology Branch study the clinical features and laboratory pathophysiology of a wide variety of bone marrow failure states, hematological malignancies, and single or multi-lineage cytopenias. There are many active IRB-approved Hematology Branch research protocols for these types of subjects where requests are made for CLIA regulated diagnostic genetic analysis.
<p>An example of our protocols/projects requiring genetic analysis is for patients who participate in Clinical Protocol # 97-H-0041 or Project #94-H-0010. In these studies, some patients with aplastic anemia (AA) or severe aplastic anemia (SAA) are screened for Telomerase RNA component (TERC) gene mutations and these gene mutations are revealed by genetic analysis using the ABI 3130xL and the TF, Big Dye Terminator (BDT) v3.1 reagent &amp; SEQ BUFFER (the companion sequencing buffer). TERC is an RNA gene found in eukaryotes, which is a component of telomerase used to extend telomeres. This procedure using the genetic analyzers and the associated reagents and instruments/accessories manufactured by Life Technologies (formerly Applied Biosystems). The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) regulate all laboratory testing (except research) performed on humans in the U.S. through the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). The Division of Laboratory Services, within the Survey and Certification Group, under the Office of Clinical Standards and Quality (OCSQ) has the responsibility for implementing the CLIA Program. Diagnostic testing under CLIA regulation requires that the genetic analyzers be calibrated and maintained in accordance with manufacturer specifications.</p>
<p>The period of performance will be one-year from date of award.<br /><br />The basis for the sole source determination is based upon the fact that: Life Technologies does not authorize any third party service provider to perform maintenance and repair on Applied Biosystems instruments. Life Technologies is the only manufacturer authorized service provider for AB instruments. Life Technologies maintains IP rights to its collection software and service tools software. Third party resellers and service providers are strictly prohibited from accessing, using or selling this software. Life Technologies has not entered into any agreement with any Asset Management or Insurance company.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) as set forth under FAR Part 13.106-1 (b) and is exempt from the requirements of FAR Part 6, Competition Requirements.</p>

<p><br /><strong>THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT, NOT A REQUEST FOR A PROPOSAL. A SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED AND PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE REQUESTED.</strong></p>
<p>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Office of Acquisition (OA) on behalf of the National Human Genome Research Institute intends to negotiate and award a purchase order on a noncompetitive sole source basis to International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC) Podoconiosis Research, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia to conduct a research trial that compares a standardized parent-directed health behavior change intervention (SHE) promotes consistent shoe wearing by an index child aged 3 to 6 regarding footwear practices among children at high risk for podoconiosis in Ethiopia,to produce intervention materials for a podoconiosis prevention and education research study.  <strong>This is a Follow-On requirement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Period of Performance</strong>: May 2013 through October 2013.</p>
<p>The sole source determination is based on the fact that National Institute of Health (NIH) is the nation's leading medical research agency and the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting medical discoveries that improve people's health and save lives. The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), Social &amp; Behavioral Research Branch (SDRB) in partnership with the Mossy Foot Treatment and Prevention Association (MFTPA) in Ethiopia, has conducted formative research to support the development and delivery of prevention and education intervention to address the problem of podoconiosis in the Wolaita region of Ethiopia.  The National Human Genome Research Institute has been partnering with the Mossy Foot Treatment and Prevention Association (MFTPA) and Addis Ababa University in conducting extensive qualitative research regarding footwear practices among children at high risk for podoconiosis in the Wolaita zone of Ethiopia.  A complement of focus groups, individual interviews and case studies with parents and children now have been completed in four target communities.  The intervention was developed and testing started in September 2012 with necessary approvals gained from NHGRI's IRB and the government of Ethiopia. This has allowed NHGRI to start collecting preliminary data to base the study on. Over the past 8 months the contract workers in Ethiopia have determined appropriate candidates and met with families in the Woliata Zone of Ethiopia. After reviewing the initial data, it was determined that it is vital to this project that the next step in data collection be undertaken to utilize the effects of the rainy season in this zone.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</strong></span></p>
<p>The overarching objectives of the activities proposed is to conduct a research trial that compares a standardized parent-directed health behavior change intervention (SHE) promotes consistent shoe wearing by an index child aged 3 to 6 (as reported by the participating adult in affected families who receive shoes from the MFTPA - henceforth "high risk children").  Additionally the research trial will evaluate whether supplementary education about inherited susceptibility to soil exposure added to the SHE intervention decreases stigma among affected (self-stigma) and unaffected (e.g., social distancing) adults, and in turn, consistent shoe wearing among high risk children. The contractor shall continue to oversee the conduct of a 3 group controlled intervention trial that uses quasi-experimental methods to evaluate 2 different health education approaches to increase consistent shoe wearing among high risk children. The study has moved past the randomization of sites, selection of affected and unaffected households, the public health campaign, and delivery of training by Lay Health Advisors into the next phase.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Qualitative assessment of Group 3</span>. Inherited susceptibility education response:  A random sample of parent-participants from affected (10% or approx 20 parents) and unaffected households (5% or approx 20) will be asked to participate in a semi-structured interview to occur within 2 weeks of the initial household intervention (that is described in the next section). The interview questions will be based on the common-sense model and be aimed to explore in more depth, participants' reactions to the curriculum on inherited susceptibility to soil sensitivity.  Understanding of the joint contribution of susceptibility and exposure as causes of podoconiosis will be explored.  Additionally, the effects these understandings have on perceived preventability of podoconiosis and its impact on stigma will be explored.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3-month follow-up data collection.</span> Trained research assistants shall visit the 600 affected and 1200 unaffected households previously participating in the baseline data collection.  Research assistants shall obtain consent and then administer a 25-minute 3-month follow-up survey.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Affected households in Groups 2 &amp; 3 - Booster session</span>.  Approximately 6 months after the initial household education session, a booster session of approximately 90 minutes will be conducted with each participating adult in affected households.  The objectives for the booster visit will be to:  (a) refresh didactic information about protecting the child's foot from exposure to soil and how best to wear shoes and maintain foot hygiene; (b) to go over experiences dealing with barriers to foot wear and reinvigorate efforts to overcome barriers, and (c) to address barriers specific to the upcoming rainy season that will make it harder to consistently wear shoes.  Additionally for Group 3, the LHA shall review issues related to (d) inherited soil sensitivity and discuss/correct any recurring misconceptions.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community intervention booster.</span> The contractor shall see that communities assigned to Groups 2 &amp; 3 are exposed to a second public health campaign to raise general awareness of the importance of children wearing shoes.  As for the first campaign, posters, stickers and buttons with the study logo, and a children's song will be used around the time of second shoe distribution.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Contractor Requirements</strong></span></p>
<p>The contractor shall provide scientific oversight of the conduct of the research trial.  The specific requirements are to:</p>
<p>&bull;	Possess extensive expertise in the epidemiology of podoconiosis and experience in conducting public health interventions in the Wolaita zone of Ethiopia;<br />&bull;	Speak Amharic and Wolatinya (dialects used in the Wolaita zone);<br />&bull;	Relationships with community and religious leaders;<br />&bull;	Experience conducting surveys with those speaking Wolatinya;<br />&bull;	Experience training lay health workers in the Wolaita zone; and<br />&bull;	Lead and steer the intervention activities that will take place in Wolaita, Ethiopia, in collaboration with the local communities and the Mossy Foot Treatment and Prevention Association.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Government Responsibilities</span></strong></p>
<p>The Government will print health educational materials, field data collection tools (e.g., surveys, audio-recording equipment).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reporting Requirements and Deliverables</strong></span></p>

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Office of the Director, on behalf of the National Institute of Deafness and other Communication Disorders (NIDCD), intends to solicit and negotiate on a non-competitive basis with only one source, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas. The cited authorities are 41U.S.C. 253(c)(1), as set forth in FAR 6.302-1. The anticipated period of performance is a one-year base period with two (2) one-year option periods.
<p><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) via the NIH Intramural Center for Tobacco Regulatory Science (ICTRS) will provide support for this project, "Genetic factors in taste perception and tobacco usage."</p>
<p>This project is a collaborative investigation into the role of inherited differences in taste perception in tobacco use, taking advantage of our substantial experience in the genetics of human taste perception and the role of taste variation in tobacco use.</p>
<p>During the course of this project, we will catalog and quantify the variation in genes that encode the taste perception system and use these to measure association between taste-specific genetic variants and tobacco use in a large multi-ethnic U.S. population sample. This will include studies of the genes encoding receptors for menthol, bitter, sweet and savory, sour, and burning tastes. It also includes genes encoding the downstream signaling components in taste cells. These variants will be assayed in study population that has been well characterized for cardiovascular risk factors including tobacco use.<br /><br />The overall goal of this project is to determine whether variation in the genes encoding the menthol and other taste receptors is associated with tobacco use, including the use of mentholated cigarettes.</p>
<p>The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center owns and possesses samples from the Dallas Heart Study population.&nbsp; There is no other population sample of comparable size and ethnic composition that has DNA samples and tobacco use data available.&nbsp; The use of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center DNA sequencing core facility is mandated by UT Southwestern, who is the sole owner of the Dallas Heart Study DNA samples.&nbsp; This organization has the resources to perform whole-exome DNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses of the existing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA sequence variation in this data.<br />&emsp;<br />Organizations having demonstrated experience in performing the above requirements are invited to submit capability statements.&nbsp; Capability statements must document the following:</p>
<p>1) Perform bioinformatic analyses of the existing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) DNA sequence variation data in the identified study population (approximately 20,000 SNP loci per individual) to determine the haploypte structure and search for associations with 14 existing tobacco use measures in these individuals.</p>
<p>2) Perform whole-exome DNA sequencing in study population subjects who represent the highest 12.5% and lowest 12.5% of tobacco use. Exome capture will be performed using the Illumina TruSeq exome selection/enrichment system and sequencing will be performed on an Illumina HiSeq 1000 instrument to generate &gt;50-fold coverage of the exonic sequences in these individuals. Quality control measures will be performed on Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer and Applied Biosystems quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) instruments.</p>
<p>3) Gather and analyze data on four aspects of mentholated or other flavored tobacco use of individuals described in Section 2 above; existing genotypes typed across the genome in the identified study population will be evaluated directly.</p>
<p>4) Data will be managed and stored in ANSI-compliant PostgreSQL relational database maintained at the contractor's location, with state-of-the-art protection of anonymity and confidentiality of all human subjects.</p>

<RESPDATE>052013
<CONTACT>Shanna Cermak, Contracting Officer, Phone 7323231576, Email shanna.cermak@navy.mil
<DESC><p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Lakehurst, NJ intends to release a DRAFT Request for Proposal (RFP) for the successful design, development, integration, test, qualification, and production of a Sustainment Lighting System (SLS) for the United States Marine Corps.</p>
<p>The mission of the NAVAIR EAF Program is to provide the Marine Corps with the equipment necessary to support the rapid deployment and establishment of self-sustaining airfields in austere, expeditionary operating environments with minimal infrastructure. This capability is achieved through the installation of one or more EAF subsystems, which include airfield surfacing systems, expeditionary arresting gear, terminal guidance systems and airfield lighting and marking systems. Headquarters Marine Corps has identified the need to replace legacy EAF airfield lighting systems in order to increase operational capability. Presently fielded EAF airfield lighting systems are not capable of supporting runway operations in Category I (CAT I) Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) metrological conditions, and a need exists to improve compatibility with Night Vision Devices (NVD) at both runways and Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) sites.</p>
<p>The SLS shall be comprised of two individual, but interoperable, airfield lighting modules to appropriately scope the capability and optimize the equipment necessary to meet the diverse operating needs of Marine Aviation during deployments and at garrison training sites. These two modules and their contents are described as follows:</p>
<p>&bull; VTOL Module shall provide the components necessary to support nighttime vertical lift aircraft operating in Visual Flight Rules (VFR) meteorological conditions at remote sites and within an airfield complex without the need for an external power interface. The VTOL Module consists of edge lighting, wind indication and controllers (both portable and pilot-activated).</p>
<p>&bull; Runway Module shall provide the components necessary to define the operating surface of a 6,000 foot long bi-directional runway and its associated taxiways, in addition to providing visual approach aids, wind cones, informational lighting and signage, and controllers. The Runway Module shall provide additional runway edge lighting and associated cabling and hardware to expand the runway by up to 2000 feet in length as a separate package. The composition of components must allow for system installations to be scaled for different airfield dimensions and for the ability to continue aircraft launch and recovery operations as meteorological conditions degrade. The Runway Module shall include three approach light systems in order to support runway operations in VFR, Non-Precision IFR, and CAT I IFR meteorological conditions, as defined by the Marine Corps below:</p>
<p>VFR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1000 foot ceiling, 3 statute mile visibility<br />Non-Precision IFR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 250 foot ceiling, &frac34; statute mile visibility<br />CAT I Precision IFR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200 foot ceiling, &frac12; statute mile visibility</p>
<p>In addition to the above requirements, the DRFAFT RFP will also include production options to procure Runway Modules, VTOL Modules and a Schoolhouse Runway Module, as well as options for the procurement of training and associated data, operations manuals and data rights. These options may be exercised at the Government's discretion. <br /><br />The Government intends to procure the above items under a full and open competition, resulting in a single award being made. All contractors seeking award must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) Database. The Statement of Work (SOW), Specification and all Attachments/Exhibits will be available, upon request, when the draft solicitation is released. Upon release of the draft solicitation, please contact Shanna Cermak at shanna.cermak@navy.mil to request of copy of aforementioned documents.</p>
<p>In addition to being on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website, the draft solicitation will also appear on the NAVAIR homepage located at http://www.navair.navy.mil/doing_business/open_solicitations/ . Select "Business", then "Doing Business with Us", and finally "Open Solicitations".</p>
<p>The draft solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps and the NAVAIR Web Site on or about 07 May 2013 as N68335-13-R-0028.</p>

<DESC>NSN 1R-5998-014648929-EY, TDP VER 002, QTY 60 EA, DELIVERY FOB ORIGIN. This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in
order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures, as approved
by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over
the part in the intended application. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source. If you are not an approved source you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in one of the NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (NAVSUP WSS) Source Approval Information Brochures
listed below. Spares: www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx Repair: www.neco.navy.mil/sarr.aspx These brochures identify the technical data required
to be submitted based on your company's experience in production of the same or similar item, or if this is an item you have never made. If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which forwarded your request for source approval. Offers received which fail to provide all data required by the Source Approval Brochure or document previous submission of all data required by the Source Approval Brochure will not be considered for award under this solicitation. Please note, if evaluation of a source approval request submitted hereunder cannot be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the ability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs. The NAVSUP
WSS Commercial Item Identification Brochureis now available at: "https://www.neco.navy.mil/cib.aspx". -SEE NOTES 9, 22, 26

<DESC>The United States Government seeks to lease office and related support space consisting of approximately 10,900 rentable square feet of office and warehouse space and 1.6 acres of wareyard space in Las Vegas, Nevada. The space should yield a minimum of 10,900 ANSI/BOMA square feet (minimum 900 ABOA office and 10,000 warehouse). The office, warehouse and wareyard space shall be contiguous (the office must be inside the office/warehouse building and the wareyard must be immediately contiguous to the office/warehouse building). <br /><br />The warehouse space offered must have a minimum ceiling clear height of 16'. The space offered must be modifiable to install windows in the exterior walls to provide natural light for the office area and to install roll up doors with a minimum dimension of 14'H x 12"W. The wareyard area must be securable via a fence and adequate lighting. An up-to-date Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment will be required. <br /><br />The proposed space must be located within the following delineated area and must have the following characteristics: <br /><strong><br />North</strong>: Sahara Avenue;<br /><strong>South</strong>: South Hollywood Boulevard, Pabco Road, Warm Springs Road;<br /><strong>East</strong>: Blue Diamond (Rainbow to I15), St Rose Parkway (I15 to 215), 215/564 (564 to Warm Springs Road);<br /><strong>West</strong>: South Rainbow Boulevard.<br /><br />The space should be located in areas similar in nature to an industrial area which is open and has a low population density. Because the agency uses very large vehicles to perform their mission, the space cannot be located in high traffic areas to ensure agency vehicles have adequate turning radius' (are able to exit onto streets and roads in a timely manner without waiting long periods for other vehicles to clear) and are not creating traffic disturbances (blocking traffic). Spaces which are located in areas with easy access to large thoroughfares are preferred.<br /><br />Fully serviced leases are sought. All services, supplies, utilities and tenant alterations are to be provided as part of the rental consideration. The offered space must meet the Governments requirements for Fire, Life-safety, and Handicapped Accessibility. <br /><br />Property located within a base floodplain (100 year floodplain) or wetland will not be considered. <br /><br />The term of the proposed lease is ten (10) years, five (5) years firm. Occupancy is required on or before July 31, 2012. <br /><br />SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS:<br />Expressions of interest must be submitted in writing and should include the following information at minimum (This is not an invitation for bids or a request for proposals):
<p>&bull; Building name/address<br />&bull; Legal property description, recent survey, and property identification numbers (PIN).<br />&bull; Location of space in the building and date it will be available.<br />&bull; One-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered and Site Plan..<br />&bull; ANSI/BOMA defined office area/useable square feet (USF).<br />&bull; Rentable Square Feet (RSF) offered and rental rate per square foot, specifying services, utilities, and tenant improvement allowance included.<br />&bull; Common Area Factor used to determine the RSF.<br />&bull; Name, address, telephone number, and email address of authorized contact.<br />&bull; In cases where an agent is representing multiple ownership entities, written acknowledgement, and permission to represent multiple owners for the same submission</p>
<p>AUTHORIZED CONTACTS:<br />GSA is using a tenant broker to represent the Government in lease negotiations for this transaction. In no event shall a potential offeror enter into negotiations or discussions concerning a space to be leased with representatives of any federal agency other than the authorized officers and employees of the General Services Administration (GSA) or their authorized representative CBRE, Inc.<br /><br />Interested parties should submit pertinent information to the tenant broker and the GSA Contracting Officer:</p>

<p>Public transportation, public and commercial parking at reasonable rates, and/or on-site parking shall be available within two (2) blocks of the proposed space. Restricted or metered parking of one (1) hour or less within the two-block area of the space does not meet parking requirements.</p>
<p>Parking for the disabled shall be located within the same block. Where onsite parking for the handicapped is not available, a loading/unloading zone shall be provided directly outside the building entrance.</p>
<p>Offered space must be contiguous on one floor.</p>
<p>Site must have direct access from the adjacent street.</p>
<p>Space requiring ramps within the office area will not be acceptable.</p>
<p>Street level space is preferred.</p>

<p>Offered space must not be more than twice as long as it is wide.</p>
<p>Offered space must have a minimum column spacing of 20 feet.</p>
<p>Offered space must allow for two separate and distinct points of ingress and egress to/from the tenant suite for employee and public access.</p>
<p><br />The Government intends to use this information from prospective sources to issue a Request for Lease Proposals (RLP).</p>

The proposed leased space shall be fully serviced. Offered space shall not be in the 100 year flood plain.</p>
<p>The Government is considering alternative space if economically advantageous. The Government will use the information it receives in response to this advertisement as a basis to develop a cost-benefit analysis to determine whether to compete the lease requirement or pursue a sole source justification to remain at its current location. In making this determination, the Government will consider, among other things, the availability of alternate space that potentially can satisfy the Government's requirements, as well as costs likely to be incurred through relocating, such as physical move costs, replication of tenant improvements and telecommunications infrastructure, and non-productive agency downtime.</p>

Statement of work
Pallid Sturgeon Use, Migrations and Spawning in the Milk River and Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam Background Federally endangered pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) in the upper Missouri River basin have spawning access to the Yellowstone River, Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam, and the Milk River.  The Yellowstone River exhibits mostly natural hydrologic and thermal regimes, but upstream spawning migrations are interrupted by Intake Diversion Dam  a passage barrier located about 113 km upstream.  The Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam provides spawning access to 300+ km of free-flowing river habitat; however, this system is hydrologically and thermally altered due to regulated discharge and hypolimnetic releases from Fort Peck Dam.  As a tributary to the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam, the Milk River provides seasonal inputs of warm turbid water that enhance hydrologic and thermal conditions in the Missouri River (Braaten and others 2009).  Enhanced environmental conditions resulting from Milk River inputs may improve suitability of the altered Missouri River for pallid sturgeon migrations and reproduction.
During 2011 and 2012, the Yellowstone River and Missouri/Milk river systems were the focus of collaborative work between Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks (MFWP) and U. S. Geological Survey Columbia Environmental Research Center (USGS) as studies examined river use, migrations, and reproduction of wild pallid sturgeon in the two river systems.  Whereas the Yellowstone River is the primary center of pre-spawn migrations and spawning activity (Bramblett and White, 2001; Fuller and others, 2008; Braaten and others, in prep), the altered Missouri River below Fort Peck provides habitat suitable for spawning when environmental conditions are enhanced.  Specifically, working under a USGS contract in FY2011, the MFWP determined that elevated flows from the Milk River in spring 2011 combined with releases of water from the Fort Peck spillway stimulated migrations and residency of several pallid sturgeon in the upper portions of the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam and in the Milk River. High intensity use of the Missouri and Milk rivers by pallid sturgeon as observed during 2011 was unparalleled as earlier research indicated very limited use of these rivers during the spawning season.  Furthermore, the first documentation of pallid sturgeon spawning in the upper Missouri River occurred during 2011 as MFWP collected a genetically confirmed wild-produced pallid sturgeon free embryo.  This individual represented the first account of a genetically confirmed wild-produced pallid sturgeon in the entire Missouri River basin.  Expanding on the 2011 work, research by MFWP in the Missouri/Milk river systems was continued during 2012 to determine if river use patterns, migration and spawning events observed in 2011 would be replicated under environmental conditions characteristic of the system in 2012.  In contrast to 2011, limited use of the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam by adult pallid sturgeon occurred in 2012 and no spawning was documented.  
Expanding on work conducted during 2011 and 2012, research activities for 2013 will focus on examining use, migrations, and potential spawning of pallid sturgeon in the Missouri/Milk river systems below Fort Peck Dam. In addition, this work will be highly complementary to 2013 USGS-MFWP research activities on the Yellowstone River as complete coverage of the Yellowstone/Missouri river hydrosystem will provide an holistic assessment of pallid sturgeon migrations, spawning events, and verification/quantification of successful incubation, hatch, and drift of free embryos and larvae.
Contactor Tasks.
The Contractor shall: 1. assess adult pallid sturgeon reproductive state, migrations, and use of the Milk River and Missouri River between Fort Peck Dam and the Yellowstone River confluence,
2. verify and quantify reproductive products (eggs, free embryos, larvae) in the Milk River and in potential spawning reaches of the Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam, and
3. assess and quantify settlement of pallid sturgeon larvae from the drift based on collections of young-of-year pallid sturgeon in the Missouri River.
Task Approaches.
1. Assess adult pallid sturgeon reproductive state, migrations, and use of the Milk River and Missouri River between Fort Peck Dam and the Yellowstone River confluence,
As part of past and ongoing research activities conducted by MFWP and USGS, a research population of wild adult male and female pallid sturgeon (50+ individuals) is currently implanted with radio and sonic transmitters.  Female reproductive status is either known or suspected based on past reproductive events; however, individuals will be assessed during April/May 2013 to confirm reproductive readiness.  In addition to reproductively assessing individuals, radio transmitters will be replaced in those individuals that carry an expired/expiring transmitter.  Migrations into and use of the Milk River and Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam by the research population of transmitted pallid sturgeon shall be assessed from early May through July using a combination of manual tracking and automated logging from ground-based telemetry stations positioned in the Milk River and at several locations in the Missouri River.  Reproductive stage shall be assessed (via blood samples, gonad samples) as individuals enter, reside, and exit the two river systems.  A change in reproductive state (for example, female loss of weight, body cavity void of eggs, blood-hormones indicative of post-reproductive levels) will provide an indication of pallid sturgeon spawning.
2. Verify and quantify reproductive products (eggs, free embryos, larvae) in the Milk River and in potential spawning reaches of the Missouri River downstream from Fort Peck Dam Sampling for free embryos and larvae shall be conducted in the lower Milk River and Missouri River near Wolf Point following methods outlined in Braaten and others (2010).  Sampling will be conducted at least two times per week at multiple replicate locations using paired rectangular frame nets (0.75 m width, 0.50-m height, 1.0-mm mesh) deployed to the river bed.  Nets will be fitted with a flow meter to estimate velocity and volume of water sampled.   Additional sampling locations will be targeted for intensive sampling if aggregations of pallid sturgeon are identified at a specific location.  Sampling for free embryos and larvae shall commence no later than June 3 and persist through July 31.  In the event that telemetered pallid sturgeon do not migrate into the Milk River or Missouri River, larval sampling will still be conducted in the Milk River and near Wolf Point as it is possible that non-telemetered pallid sturgeon may be spawning in either river.  All acipenseriform free embryos and larvae collected shall be live-extracted from the detritus (Fuller et al. 2008) and preserved in 95% ethanol.  Genetic testing of all acipenseriform free embryos and larvae shall be conducted to definitively identify specimens as pallid sturgeon, shovelnose sturgeon or paddlefish. 
3. Assess and quantify settlement of pallid sturgeon larvae from the drift based on collections of young-of-year pallid sturgeon in the Missouri River. Whereas telemetry coupled with gonad/hormone assessments and targeted sampling for pallid sturgeon free embryos will provide an indication of successful spawning in the Milk River or Missouri River, targeted sampling for young-of-year pallid sturgeon will provide an additional assessment of successful spawning. Targeted sampling for young-of-year pallid sturgeon will follow trawling methods outlined in Braaten and Fuller (2007).  Multiple replicates at two sites (Missouri River upstream and downstream from the Yellowstone River confluence) shall be trawled at weekly intervals between mid-July and early September.  Fin clips shall be obtained for Scaphirhynchus sp. collected, stored in 95% ethanol, and genetically processed to distinguish individuals as pallid sturgeon or shovelnose sturgeon.  Pallid sturgeon  positive samples from collections obtained in the Missouri River upstream from the Yellowstone River confluence will provide conclusive evidence of successful spawning events in the Missouri/Milk river systems. Young-of-year pallid sturgeon sampled from below the Yellowstone River confluence may contain a mix of progeny from spawning events in the Yellowstone River, Missouri River or Milk River. In either case, collections of a young-of-year pallid sturgeon will indicate sufficient riverine drift distance occurs between known or suspected spawning areas and settlement areas.
Deliverables 1.  All telemetry data shall be provided to the USGS in digital format as required by the Sturgeon Information Management System (SIMS).  The USGS will provide the computers, software, and a differential GPS unit to facilitate digital acquisition of telemetry data.
2.  Quarterly progress reports shall be prepared and provided to the USGS within 7 days after the end of the reporting period; the USGS will provide the report template.
3.  A draft report detailing scope of effort, methods and results shall be submitted to the USGS by December 31, 2013. USGS will have 21 days to review the draft reports and provide comments to the contractor. This material will be included in the USGS 2013 annual report, of which the MFWP will be designated as co-athors.
4. A final report that synthesizes telemetry results, spawning activities, captures of free embryos and larvae, and young-of-year pallid sturgeon collections from 2011-2013 shall be submitted to the USGS by March 31, 2014. 
Additional publication in the scientific literature and dissemination of research results at scientific meetings is encouraged.  All publications with USGS co-authorship shall be subjected to the USGS Fundamental Science Practices review process.
Contractor Points of Contact. To be determined.

<DESC>By way of this Notice, and in accordance with FAR 6.302-1, the USACE, Chicago District announces its intention to award a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>FOLLOW-ON</strong></em></span>&nbsp; Time &amp; Materials contract to Jay Dee Contractors (hereinafter, "JDC") for the continued performance of responding to and repairing any failures of the Critical Systems within the McCook Distribution Tunnel System (DTS). Critical Systems are defined as components that are in either intermittent or continuous operation and that would cause additional failures within the DTS should they no longer become operational. Such Critical Systems include the Sump Pumps (4 each), Electrical Switchgear (1 each), Hydraulic Power Units (HPU), and the Heating and Ventilation System. Critical Systems also include support equipment required to facilitate repairs to said Critical Systems, which includes the Bridge Crane (1 each). To fulfill this requirement, the Government requires JDC, a contractor with the detailed knowledge of the past failures and repairs so that further degradation of the facility can be prevented through proactive and effective measures implemented with efficient and prompt response times to alarms.
<p><br /><br />&nbsp; - As the original source provider of these services, JDC has the volume of expertise and proven ability to work safely in the DTS, a controlled environment. It has available, the necessary technical staff and resources to address any critical issues, which is essential to sustain the operability of this&nbsp;major and complex system.&nbsp; An inexperienced contractor could inadvertently delay or prolong troubleshooting and / or repairs of systems components, which could in turn, lead to additional damages and repairs costs. This scenario is likely due to the complexity of the various systems and would take time to fully understand. The contractor would need to develop his own protocol to respond to alarms and troubleshoot the situation. With JDC continuing the work, this would not be the case, as it has demonstrated that it can respond quickly and efficiently as been shown on their current contract.</p>
<p>JDC was established in 1965 and has completed over 637,000 linear feet (over 120 miles) of tunnels in a variety of soil conditions. To reemphasize, Jay Dee has a staff of highly skilled professionals who combine technical expertise with extensive field experience in tunneling and underground construction. Jobsite safety is a major concern at Jay Dee and the company is committed to providing a safe working environment for its employees and promoting a culture of safety throughout the company.</p>
<p>JDC constructed the Cady Marsh Drainage Ditch Tunnel project, contract number W912P6-04-C-0008 for the Chicago District, started in 2004 and completed in 2007. The project consisted of an approximately 6,440-foot long, 10-foot finished diameter, concrete-lined tunnel. It received an Outstanding rating for the work with such comments as: "Jay Dee's steadfast dedication to achieve a quality product exceeded the expectations of the Government", "Jay Dee's field office and home office proved to be customer-focused and worked well with the Corps of Engineers and local sponsor", "their superintendent was very organized and ensured that all punch list items were completed in a timely manner", "was able to complete the work prior to the contract completion date despite delays caused by sponsor requested contract changes" and "had a thorough safety plan which included Jay Dee's own inspection program policy".</p>
<p>JDC has constructed three projects this Agency's Local Sponsor of the McCook Distribution Tunnel System, Metropolitan Water District of Greater Chicago. They built the Thornton Transitional Reservoir (two tunnels totaling 10,600 LF through dolomite limestone), Calumet Tunnel system (19,000 LF of various sizes of connecting sewer and entrance conduit structures), and Richton Park Outlet (10,030 LF sewer tunnel). A partial list of other projects they have completed or are working on are: City of Columbus (20,000 LF of 14' diameter tunnel for sewer system), King County, Washington (21,000 LF of 13' tunnel in glacial till), City of Philadelphia (3,600 LF of storm water conduit), City of Detroit (16,000 LF of 7' diameter tunnel), Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (overhaul of wastewater treatment plant), Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District (10,030 LF of 5' diameter sewer tunnel), the City of Houston (16,700 LF of sewer tunnel) and Mobil Oil Refinery in Beaumont, Texas (2,500 LF of 8.5'<br />diameter fiberglass storm water separation tunnel).</p>
<p>The performance time for this FOLLOW-ON Time &amp; Materials Contract will be approximately 365 calendar days from the date the contractor acknowledges the Notice to Proceed.</p>
<p>This notice is NOT a Request for Proposals; therefore, NO solicitation documents will be issued. Award is anticipated on or about 31 May 2013.</p>
<p>Any response to this notice must demonstrate that competition would be advantageous to the government. In doing so, interested sources must submit technical capabilities, pricing, and other information that demonstrates their ability to meet the requirements described above. Detailed capabilities must be submitted to Kim Beard prior to 4:00 p.m. (CDT) on 19 May 2013 via email to kim.m.beard@usace.army.mil, with a copy furnished to Regina Blair at regina.g.blair@usace.army.mil (ENSURE that the Solicitation Number of "W912P6-13-R-0011" &amp; Project Title is included in the subject line of your email). Note that any electronic files (EMAIL) CANNOT EXCEED this Agency's size limit of 20MB (includes email and its attachments); files exceeding this size will be denied access to Ms. Blair's and Ms. Beard's email inbox.</p>
<p>No contract will be awarded on the basis of offers received in response to this notice, but<br />offers will be used to determine if a comparable source is available and more advantageous to the government. If no affirmative written response is received by 4:00 p.m. (CDT) on 19 May 2013, a contract may be issued to JDC without further notice.</p>
<p>Points of Contact for this Notice are Kim Beard at 312-846-5378 and Regina Blair at 312-846-5371.</p>

<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command New Jersey, on behalf of the Office of the Program Manager, Close Combat Systems, (PM CCS) Picatinny Arsenal, NJ are currently seeking sources for the manufacture, assembly, inspection, testing, packaging, shipping and delivery of the Receiver, Magneto-Inductive Firing Device: Non-Electric Blasting Cap Actuating, M40 and the Training Kit, Magneto-Inductive Receiver: M331. <br>  <br> The M40 and  M331 are part of the Magneto Inductive Remote Activation Munition System (MI-RAMS) which is a firing device that provides an untethered capability to command control the detonation of demolition charges and munitions. MI-RAMS can penetrate through media such as earth, rock, fresh water, salt water, dense foliage, and man-made structures by utilizing Ultra Electronics' Magneto-Inductive (MI) communication channel. The MI-RAMS consist of a M27 Transmitter and two types of receivers, the M39 receiver and the M40 receiver. The M40 receiver produces an explosive output (one-shot receiver) capable of detonating a wide variety of demolition and munition systems. The M40 Receiver, upon receipt of a correct unique coded MI signal from an M27 Transmitter, produces an explosive output capable of detonating a secondary explosive lead/cap that is attached to any demolition charges and munitions. The M331 trainer is an inert functional trainer device, designed to replicate the functions of the M40 Receiver. Therefore, the trainer is capable of performing all operational functions of the M40 with the exception of the explosive output which is replaced with a visual indicator such as a flashing Light Emitting Diode (LED) as the only indication of firing.   <br>  <br> Potential sources shall be capable of producing, manufacturing, assembling, inspecting, testing, packaging and shipping the M40 and M331 in accordance with a Government Technical Data Package (TDP), drawings and specifications. The Government Technical Data Package will not be provided.  <br> The applicable NAICS code for this effort is: 325920 Explosive Manufacturing.  <br>  <br> The M40 is Arms Ammunition and Explosive (AA&E) category IV with a 1.4S Hazard Classification, therefore respondents to this survey shall state their ability to handle AA&E items and their ability to comply with DoD 4145.26 M and DoD5100.76M, as applicable and all required Federal Acquisition Regulations applicable to the production and manufacturing of AA&E and hazardous items.  <br>  <br> Key Specifications for the M40 Receiver are as follows:  <br>  <br> a.     Shall have the capability of initiating one energetic lead equivalent to the M7 non-electric military blasting cap to create or initiate a high order detonation of the charge being primed with the device. <br> b.     Shall interface with the standard military blasting cap well on standard U.S. military explosives. <br> c.     Shall interface and be compatible with current military demolitions and munitions with attached energetic lead. <br> d.     Shall have the capability of being programmed and functioned by only one unique transmission code of any MI-RAMS M27 Transmitter until reset. <br> e.     Shall indicate that the receiver has been successfully programmed via the LED indicator. <br> f.     Shall retain the programmed transmitter code when turned off in memory for 30 days. <br> g.     Shall have a test function allow transmitter code verification indicated via the LED indicator. <br> h.     Shall have an employment time of 15 days. <br> i.     Shall not weigh more than 1.25 lbs when including the indigenous power source and excluding the antenna. <br> j.     Shall utilize an antenna with a connector that allows the user to remove the antenna. The antenna shall weigh no more than 1.0 pounds. <br> k.     Shall fit into the cargo pocket of the ACU trouser. <br> l.     Shall measure near-field MI noise levels and actively indicate whether it is in an area of acceptable noise via the use of an LED. <br> m.     Shall have a 5-minute safe separation time prior to the receivers arming. <br> n.

<DESC>DESCRIPTION OF INTENT: <br>  <br> THIS IS A MARKET SURVEY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IN SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING POTENTIAL REQUIREMENT.  No contract will be awarded from this announcement.  This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP) or an announcement of a forthcoming solicitation, nor is it a request seeking contractors to be placed on a solicitation mailing list.  Response to this survey is voluntary and no reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this market survey and any follow-on information requests.  Data submitted in response to this market survey will not be returned.  No solicitation documents exist at this time, and calls requesting a solicitation will not be answered. <br>  <br> TOPIC: <br>  <br> The Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) Ground System Survivability (GSS) group is conducting a market survey soliciting information from industry concerning an Electronic Warfare Countermeasure (EWCM) apparatus capable of defensive counteractions against Anti-Tank Guided Missiles (ATGM) to protect US Army ground vehicles.  The objective of this Request for Information (RFI) is to elicit written reports from competitive and highly experienced industry sources with the goals of: identifying potential EWCM suppliers who have the capability to develop, integrate, test, produce, and support an EWCM apparatus; determining the status of the state of the art of the technology; and assessing the potential for TARDEC GSS to obtain an EWCM apparatus capable of meeting a set of requirements that will be integrated into a vehicle demonstrator and successfully complete live threat defeat testing.  The information gathered from this RFI will aid in determining and defining the viability and framework of a US Army EWCM program research and development strategy, along with assessing the risks involved with implementing an EWCM capability on US Army ground vehicles.  It may facilitate and influence the trade space and requirements of a prospective Request for Proposal (RFP) for an EWCM apparatus. <br>  <br> TARDEC GSS is requesting a detailed itemization of: the current state of the EWCM's threat defeat capability; test results (lab and/or live-fire); technology readiness level; growth potential; modularity; and cost, schedule, and logistics necessary to mature the EWCM technology. TARDEC GSS is primarily seeking information concerning countermeasures; however, data regarding cueing sensors or system controllers, although not being specifically sought, will be reviewed if received. <br>  <br> Although not all inclusive, a set of questions have been developed in establishing the types of information TARDEC is interested in being addressed as part of this RFI. Utilizing the provided questions as guidance, each responding participant shall provide a detailed description of the EWCM system to include the integration requirements needed to support the technology. They shall: identify the components of the system; provide the function of each component; and provide the space, weight, cooling, and power required for each component.  They shall provide a detailed status report on the EWCM system including: which classes and/or models of ATGM threats whose guidance, tracking and/or sensing behavior are disrupted; a description of tests and analyses completed to date; an assessment of the system technology readiness level; system interface compatibility; and the growth potential to counter additional and future ATGMs.  They shall provide a maturation plan that includes specific design and development tasks, cost estimates, and any component or system level testing necessary to mature the technology to a higher Technology Readiness Level (TRL).  The maturation plan should be presented as an Integrated Master Schedule (IMS) compatible with Microsoft Office 2007. <br>  <br>  <br> RESPONSES: <br>  <br> Responses must be postmarked no later than 45 days after announcement. <br>  <br> Please address any questions regarding this market survey via email to john.m.reed9.civ@mail.mil Include name, phone number and email address for a response.  Questions may be answered via email or phone. <br>   <br> a. Each response should address the questions in the questionnaire and should include three (3) documents (at a minimum): <br> 1.

DoD Components may provide additional clarifications for Software.  Supplemental definitions follow the table. <br>  <br> Technology Readiness Level (TRL)&Description <br>  <br> 1.  Basic principles observed and reported: <br> Lowest level of technology readiness.  Scientific research begins to be translated into applied research and development.  Examples might include paper studies of a technology's basic properties. <br> 2.  Technology concept and/or application formulated: <br> Invention begins.  Once basic principles are observed, practical applications can be invented.  Applications are speculative and there may be no proof or detailed analysis to support the assumptions.  Examples are limited to analytic studies. <br>  <br> 3.  Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept: <br> Active research and development is initiated.  This includes analytical studies and laboratory studies to physically validate analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology.  Examples include components that are not yet integrated or representative. <br>  <br> 4.  Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment: <br> Basic technological components are integrated to establish that they will work together.  This is relatively  quote mark low fidelity quote mark  compared to the eventual system.  Examples include integration of  quote mark ad hoc quote mark  hardware in the laboratory. <br>  <br> 5.  Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment: <br> Fidelity of breadboard technology increases significantly.  The basic technological components are integrated with reasonably realistic supporting elements so it can be tested in a simulated environment.  Examples include  quote mark high fidelity quote mark  laboratory integration of components. <br>  <br> 6.  System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment: <br> Representative model or prototype system, which is well beyond that of TRL 5, is tested in a relevant environment.  Represents a major step up in a technology's demonstrated readiness.  Examples include testing a prototype in a high-fidelity laboratory environment or in simulated operational environment. <br>  <br> 7.  System prototype demonstration in an operational environment: <br> Prototype near, or at, planned operational system.  Represents a major step up from TRL 6, requiring demonstration of an actual system prototype in an operational environment such as an aircraft, vehicle, or space.  Examples include testing the prototype in a test bed aircraft. <br>  <br> 8.  Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration: <br> Technology has been proven to work in its final form and under expected conditions.  In almost all cases, this TRL represents the end of true system development.  Examples include developmental test and evaluation of the system in its intended weapon system to determine if it meets design specifications. <br>  <br> 9.  Actual system proven through successful mission operations: <br> Actual application of the technology in its final form and under mission conditions, such as those encountered in operational test and evaluation.  Examples include using the system under operational mission conditions. <br>  <br>  <br> DEFINITIONS: <br>  <br> BREADBOARD:  Integrated components that provide a representation of a system/subsystem and which can be used to determine concept feasibility and to develop technical data.  Typically configured for laboratory use to demonstrate the technical principles of immediate interest.  May resemble final system/subsystem in function only. <br>  <br>  quote mark HIGH FIDELITY quote mark :  Addresses form, fit and function.  High-fidelity laboratory environment would involve testing with equipment that can simulate and validate all system specifications within a laboratory setting. <br>  <br>  quote mark LOW FIDELITY quote mark :  A representative of the component or system that has limited ability to provide anything but first order information about the end product.  Low-fidelity assessments are used to provide trend analysis. <br>  <br> MODEL:  A functional form of a system, generally reduced in scale, near or at operational specification.  Models will be sufficiently hardened to allow demonstration of the technical and operational capabilities required of the final system. <br>  <br> OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT:  Environment that addresses all of the operational requirements and specifications required of the final system to include platform/packaging. <br>  <br> PROTOTYPE:  A physical or virtual model used to evaluate the technical or manufacturing feasibility or military utility of a particular technology or process, concept, end item or system. <br>  <br> RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT:  Testing environment that simulates the key aspects of the operational environment. <br>  <br> SIMULATED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL:  Either 1) a real environment that can simulate all of the operational requirements and specifications required of the final system, or 2) a simulated environment that allows for testing of a virtual prototype; used in either case to determine whether a developmental system meets the operational requirements and specifications of the final system. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> UNCLASSIFIED <br>  <br>  <br>  UNCLASSIFIED: Dist A.

<DESC>This sources sought notice is issued for information and planning purposes only.  No solicitation is available at this time.  The purpose of this notice is to identify sources with the requisite qualifications that could provide the services stated herein.  All business, large and small business, to include certified Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), certified 8(a), Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB), Economically Disadvantage Woman Owned Small Business (EDWOSB), Veteran Owned Small Business (VOSB), Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), or Small Disadvantage Business (SDB) capable of performing the requirement indicated below are encouraged to respond to this notice by completing and submitting the attached Sources Sought Questionnaire to the Government.  You are advised that providing responses to the questions will not automatically include you in the acquisition process for future solicitation.  An important outcome of this research is the possibility of setting aside this acquisition for exclusive competitive participation within a specific Small Business Administration (SBA) program in accordance with (IAW) FAR 19.201(a).   <br>   <br> Description of services.  Joint Base Lewis-McChord Range Support and Gray Army Airfield Airspace Information Center require real-time displays of aircraft position, altitude, and speed while aircraft are operating at low altitude in the JBLM Tactical Terrain Flight Training Area.  Due to terrain obscuring existing RADAR signals, these RADAR feeds do not identify aircraft operating below approximately 500' Above Ground Level (AGL).  The altitudes routinely flown by JBLM aircraft operating within the TTFTA are from the surface to 300' AGL.  A Wide Area Multilateration (WAM) system overcomes the RADAR limitation of terrain obscuration by utilizing a network of aircraft surveillance sensors installed within and in the vicinity of the area in which surveillance coverage is required.  See attached draft PWS for more information. <br>  <br> Disclaimer.  This Sources Sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposals (RFP), Invitation for Bid (IFB), or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services.  Responses to this Sources Sought shall not serve as proposals, bids, or offers, which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  MICC JBLM will not accept unsolicited proposals related to the subject of this Sources Sought.  The responder must clearly identify any information it considers sensitive or proprietary.

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement seeking responses from all business concerns, to include: large businesses; 8(a), HUBZone, and women-owned small businesses;   veteran-owned small businesses; small disadvantaged businesses; service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses; and, economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses.  The Mission and Installation Contracting Command (MICC)-Fort Eustis, Virginia is seeking competition for contract support services for the Army Capabilities Integration Center (ARCIC) to execute its mission regarding current and future warfighting challenges.  This requirement is for an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) multiple award task order contract (MATOC) to acquire mission support services.  The Government anticipates a maximum ceiling value of $240M over the life of the ARCIC MATOC. <br>  <br> Background:  The ARCIC, a subordinate organization of U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) at Fort Eustis, Virginia, is one of the leading organizations that assist the Army in preparing for current and future warfighting challenges.  The mission of the ARCIC is to develop, evaluate, and integrate warfighting concepts, requirements, and solutions for the Army across the domains of Doctrine, Organization, Training, Materiel, Leader development, Personnel, and Facilities (DOTMLPF) to provide Soldiers and units the capabilities they need to support Combatant Commanders' operations in a Joint, interagency, intergovernmental and multi-national (JIIM) environment.  The successful development and integration of DOTMLPF solutions by the ARCIC is critical to improving the survivability of the Army.  ARCIC actively supports the Army's transition to a future force - one that is focused on developing adaptive leaders and organizations, modernizing equipment, and revolutionizing training. <br>  <br> Because the combat operations in which the Army participates are inherently Joint, the ARCIC cannot accomplish its mission in isolation.  The ARCIC must coordinate its activities with the TRADOC staff, TRADOC's subordinate schools and Centers of Excellence (CoEs), other Army commands (ACOMs), the Services, and JIIM partner organizations. <br>  <br> Task order requests (TORs) may originate from any ARCIC subordinate organization, Department of Defense (DOD), or Department of the Army (DA) agency working initiatives in support of the ARCIC.  Work is predominately located at Fort Eustis, Fort Bliss, White Sands Missile Range, the National Capital Region, and to a lesser extent at the TRADOC Centers of Excellence, which include Fort Benning, Fort Gordon, Fort Huachuca, Fort Lee, Fort Leonard Wood, Fort Leavenworth, Fort Rucker, and Fort Sill.  However, attendance at meetings, briefings, conferences, and events both locally and at remote locations, including possibly OCONUS, shall be required.  Individual task orders will specify specific requirements in detail, along with acceptable levels of performance and other pertinent information relative to the task(s).  Known contract requirements anticipated to be issued via TOR(s) currently exist within the following ARCIC activities: ARCIC Forward; Operations, Plans, and Policy Division; Joint and Army Experimentation Division; Future Warfare Division; Joint and Army Models/Simulations Division; Concept Development and Learning Director's Office; Joint Interdependency Coordination Division; Human Dimensions Task Force; LandWarNet Division; Sustainment Division; Maneuver Division; Maneuver Support/Protection Division; Fires Division; Accelerated Capabilities Division; Studies and Analysis Division; Mission Command, Intelligence and Cyber Division; and the Brigade Modernization Command. <br>     <br> Required mission support may consist of any single or a combination of multiple task areas from the four task areas defined below: <br>   <br> Task Area One - Capability Development Support:  This task area seeks support to develop concepts (how the Army operates) and capabilities (what the Army can do) that provide affordable solutions to meet warfighter needs.  Concepts involve broad descriptions of what the Army must do, what capability gaps impact whether the Army can do them, and how to address these gaps.  Concept development is the foundation for future capability determination efforts.  Concepts consist of future capabilities descriptions within a proposed structure of military operations for a period of 10-20 years into the future.  From these concepts, ARCIC determines the specific capabilities the Army needs.  Capability determination involves the identification of gaps in what the Army can do associated risks, and the development of solutions to resolve or mitigate unacceptable risks.  Capability development involves detailed research and analysis of possible solutions for one or more components of DOTMLPF.  It also consists of determining, prioritizing, and documenting changes in DOTMLPF, as well as supporting analysis and studies. <br>  <br> Examples of requirements for this task area are: <br>  <br> Simulation Solutions:  Compare current Army capabilities against available simulation solutions and recommend live, virtual, and constructive integrating architecture (LVC-IA) solutions to include advanced systems recovery tools to ensure minimal downtime.  Support includes research, analysis, and test (create operational vignettes) of various LVC-IA solutions to assist ARCIC in the identification and selection of cost-benefit trade-offs for solutions that will provide the best performance and end-user experience.  LVC-IA is a network-centric linkage that collects, retrieves, and exchanges data among live instrumentation, virtual simulators, and constructive simulations as well as Joint and Army Battle Command Systems.  The LVC-IA defines  quote mark how quote mark  information is exchanged among the LVC domains and Battle Command Systems.  The LVC-IA includes common LVC components such as command and control adapters, terrain databases, multi-level security, and hardware/software.  White papers include as a minimum:  abstracts, analysis on advantages / disadvantages, implementation plans, and recommendations. <br>  <br> Warfighter Needs Analysis:  Identify, analyze, summarize, and capture needed warfighter capabilities into a warfighter needs database and then extract the accumulated data to produce reports for use by combat developers designing the future force. <br>  <br> Emerging Technologies:  Conduct studies, assess, and offer recommendations on applicable emerging technologies.  This includes the design, development, and execution of web-based capabilities, knowledge management capabilities, cloud computing, social networking, and collaboration technologies. <br>  <br> Capabilities Development for Rapid Transition (CDRT) analysis:  Identify, assess, and make recommendations regarding CDRT nominations.  CDRT involves non-program of record DOTMLPF materiel and non-materiel capabilities that have been rapidly fielded to Army units.  The objective is to assess rapidly developed capabilities equipped to deployed units and transition those proven in combat and relevant to future operations to an enduring status as quickly as possible. <br>  <br> Select and Develop Capabilities:  Support the identification of criteria and selection of capabilities to be accelerated from operational command headquarters' requests and the pre-deployment development activities.  Support ARCIC to identify required concepts of operation (CONOPS), tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), training support packages (TSPs), target organizations, interactive multimedia instruction, connecting Soldiers to digital applications initiatives, unique materiel, leader strategy development, personnel skill sets, facility requirements, budget requirements, home station training, milestones, coordination with the community of interest, etc.  Support ARCIC and/or its partners in the preparation or review of:  CONOPS documents; TTP reports; TSPs; and, Army and Joint doctrine and manuals. <br>  <br> Task Area Two - Experiment and Evaluation Support:  This task area provides support to experiments and evaluations that explore innovative methods of assessing proposed concepts and capability solutions.  Experiments and evaluations apply structured assessment procedures to substantiate the effects of proposed warfighting capabilities using discovery, hypothesis-testing, and demonstration approaches, as appropriate.  Experiments and evaluations reduce the risk to warfighters by providing credible analytical underpinnings to support decision-making and identify and verify acceptable solutions for required changes in DOTMLPF.  Experiments (generally associated with concept development) aid in validating the feasibility and utility of future requirements determination efforts.  Evaluations (associated with capability determination) are generally on a larger scale than experiments and require the set-up, conduct, execution, and documentation of live, constructive, and virtual simulations and analytical studies.  Experiments and evaluations are conducted in such environments as war games, battle labs, and exercises.  This task area involves executing, analyzing, and reporting on the results of experiments and evaluations, to include: <br>     Modeling, simulation, scenario building, and objectives analysis. <br>     Designing experiment and evaluation environments. <br>     Developing guides, procedures, and manuals to assist users and administrators of environments. <br>     Planning, preparing, and delivering training on environments. <br>  <br> Examples of requirements for this task area are: <br>  <br> Wargame Support:  Support ARCIC to plan, design, and coordinate execution of wargame events.  Support ARCIC in develop of draft plans of execution, event materials, participant manning documents, participant reference material, and structure and schedule of events.  Support ARCIC in development and modify scenarios to reflect the capabilities and concepts for Blue, Red and other forces used in wargame events.  Support ARCIC by recording and maintain copies of emerging insights from game players, analysts, facilitators, and personnel that will contribute to daily assessment sessions during the events.  Coordinate execution of wargame events with the Government, based on each event design and established timeline. <br>  <br> Battle Lab Collaborative Simulation Environment (BLCSE) Technical Support:  Maintain the technical aspects of the BLCSE Federation for both standing technical baselines and event specific versions and modifications.  Support technical integration of various simulations and simulation federations through development of Federation Object Models and Simulation Object Models under the procedures of the High Level Architecture IEEE-1516 standard and enumerations and protocol data units under procedures of the Distributed Interactive Simulation IEEE-1278 standard. <br>   <br> Joint and Army Experiments Analysis:  Investigate and assess results of key Joint and Army experiments conducted during the previous fiscal year, as well as lessons learned from ongoing military operations.  Research and provide recommendations that prepare the ARCIC to conduct future experiments by:  identifying detailed assessment objectives; highlighting discrete issues to be examined within and across the warfighting functions; informing participants on the new warfighting tenets to be assessed in the experiment; identifying key participants and their preferred qualifications; and preparing advance materials for the experiments.  Recommend adjustments to selected experiments so that they achieve their intended objectives or adapt to meet the demands of emerging objectives.  Assess the campaign objectives for experimentation events and activities, identifying the degree to which each event achieved the stated objectives.  After the conclusion of the previous fiscal year's Army experimentation campaign, analyze the results and recommend enhancements to the next year's experimentation guidance, policies, and processes. <br>  <br> Environment Enhancement:  Implement and document approved LVC integrated training environment enhancements to the Brigade Modernization Command's Mission Command Complex (BMC-MCC).  This includes: <br>     Exercise facility preparation, prior to events/exercises, and recovery to include simulation/stimulation injects and product enhancements. <br>     Development of draft BMC-MCC systems administration manual and standing operating procedures (SOP). <br>     Equipment inventories and maintenance. <br> Unit Instruction:  Teach and train units to use simulations and technology. <br>     Consult with users to design, create, and configure systems to meet their training requirements. <br>     Travel to locations to attend training and gain skills required for installation, configuration, scenario development, and end-user training. <br>     Plan, prepare, and deliver training on simulations and technology to trainers and users (Soldiers) and develop training methods and material such as curriculum, lectures, and computer-based training aids based on consultation with client and user specifications. <br>  <br> C4ISR Architecture:  Develop and update the Horseblanket (HB) for the Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) architecture for each Network Integration Evaluation (NIE).

The current SSTC SOW is located at the SST II procurement website: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/sstII/		  This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Request for Information or Solicitation for Planning Purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This document is for information and planning purposes to allow industry the opportunity to verify reasonableness and feasibility of the requirement, as well as promote competition. Interested small business parties are requested to 1.) Review the current SSTC SOW, and other information available in the technical library, if applicable. 2.) Submit a statement of their firms capabilities, qualifications and state whether it is the intention of the firm to submit as a subcontractor or prime contractor.  Interested small business parties may submit capabilities and qualifications other than the areas listed above, if desired.  The determination to set aside this effort for a small business will be determined after responses are received and evaluated.  Responses must include the following: 1.	Name and address of firm; 2.	Size of business; 3.	Average annual revenue for past 3 years and number of employees; 4.	Ownership; e.g. large, Small Business (SB), SDB, 8(a), WOSB, VOSB, SD-VOSB, HUBZone, HBCU/MI; 5.	Number of years in business; 6.	Affiliate information:	parent company, joint venture partners, potential teaming partners, prime contractor (if potential sub) or subcontractors (if potential prime); 7.	List of customers covering the past five years.  Please be sure to include the following: a.	Relevant work performed.  All relevant work should be linked to where this work would be performed in the current SSTC statement of work; b.	Contract numbers, contract type, dollar value of each procurement; c.	Point of contact - address and phone number. Your response is requested by 4:00 p.m. local time on May 30, 2013. Attachment 3: Request for Organizational Conflicts of Interest NASA/JSC is requesting information from industry regarding potential organizational conflicts of interest (OCI) arising from the Simulation and Software Technology II (SST II) contract. The nature of the work anticipated under SST II may create a situation, where there could be a potential for an OCI as currently described in FAR Subpart 9.5. Each potential offeror should review FAR Subpart 9.5 in light of NASAs anticipation of OCI issues and consider carefully the extent to which an OCI may arise before making the decision to compete for the SST II. A link to the NASA Guide on Organizational Conflicts of Interest has been posted to the SST II procurement website at: http://procurement.jsc.nasa.gov/sstII		 .  Please reference this document for additional information about NASAs policies with respect to OCI issues. You are requested to provide electronic responses via e-mail to the Contracting Officer listed at the end of this synopsis. Your response is requested by 4:00 p.m. local time on May 30, 2013. Potential offerors are requested to address the following questions: 1. What type of OCI issues would your company or potential team identify, if any, should you choose to propose on the SST II contract? 2. What strategies would you anticipate proposing to mitigate the OCI issues that you identified (if any)? Please provide strategy details, previous examples/experience with other contracts with NASA or other agencies, etc. 3. Does your company foresee any OCI issues associated with the SST II contract that would cause you to decide not to propose on the potential SST II requirements? NASA intends to assess any responses received regarding potential OCI and each offerors proposed OCI mitigation strategy, responding to each company who submits a mitigation strategy in writing. NASAs response will simply be an attempt to preliminarily examine possible circumstances which might lead to or eliminate an OCI.  It will not be a confirmation that, in fact, an OCI will ultimately exist or that an offeror can successfully eliminate or mitigate an OCI.  Furthermore, the response in no way alters or interprets the application of FAR 9.5 as it applies to a final statement of work or a final proposal submission, should a potential offeror elect to submit a proposal in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) issued under a solicitation for SST II. Subsequent to the initial submission and response, the Government will not consider further information as it relates to this RFI. Responses to the RFI shall include the company name, address, and point of contact. The Government intends to release the company names, addresses, and points of contact of all respondents unless specifically requested not to do so by the respondent. This information will be provided on the SST II procurement website in an Interested Parties List. Any communications in reference to this RFI shall cite the RFI number in the subject line and be directed to the point of contact identified in the RFI. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. The Government is under no obligation to issue a solicitation or to award any contract on the basis of this RFI. The Government will not pay for any information solicited. No evaluation letters and/or results will be issued to the respondents. You are requested to provide electronic responses to all Attachments (limited to 50 pages, using no less than 12 point Times New Roman font) via e-mail to stacy.g.houston@nasa.gov.   In your response please indicate which Attachment you are addressing.  Your response is requested by 4:00 p.m. CST on May 30, 2013. No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in FedBizOpps and on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service.  It is the potential offerors responsibility to monitor these sites for the release of any solicitation or synopsis.  The Government intends to review the responses submitted by Industry.  The documents on the NASA procurement website are for information and planning purposes, to allow industry the opportunity to comment, and to promote competition only.  NASA will not affirmatively release any information received in response to this RFI to the public, but may use information received in developing the best approach for a contract strategy, and therefore such information may be recognizable to the potential offeror who submitted it.   Therefore, any data that is submitted as part of a companys response that is marked Proprietary will not be reviewed and will be returned to the respondent. Any information submitted in response to this RFI that is marked as Confidential Commercial or Financial Information will be considered as voluntarily submitted in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act.

<DESC>Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Acquisition Management Division, 100 Bureau Drive, Building 301, Room B129, Mail Stop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD, 20899-1640
<p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) seeks information on commercial vendors that are capable of providing a Terahertz Imager to support research and development in the Physical Measurement Lab.</p>
<p>Measurement and alignment of high power Terahertz (THz) laser beams requires a compact, focal plane array (FPA) camera system sensitive in the long-wave region of the spectrum. Characterization of THz beams is crucial for experiment alignment and to determine propagation characteristics of the generated beam. Until recently, the commercial marketplace was limited for these and related applications including, for example, scene evaluation for homeland security and threat detection (for DHS requirements). NIST wishes to procure a sensitive FPA system for both beam characterization and scene imaging</p>
<p>After results of this market research are obtained and analyzed, and specifications developed, NIST may conduct a competitive procurement and subsequently award a Purchase Order for a Terahertz Imager. If at least two qualified small businesses are identified during this market research stage, then any competitive procurement that resulted would be conducted as a small business set-aside.</p>
<p>The THz-FPA Imager should be able to meet or exceed the following specifications:</p>
<p>1. Operation at 30-60 Hz frame rate is required. Ability to control the repetition rate in the range is preferred.</p>
<p>2. Lock-in detection (with external chopper synchronization) for improved Signal-to-Noise (SNR) image acquisition and software or hardware pixel binning required.<br /><br />3. 240 x 320 or larger pixel microbolometer array format with no external cooling required. Pixel pitch size 30x30 micron or smaller.</p>
<p>4. Sensitivity in the 1 (or lower) to 5 THz (or higher) inclusive wavelength range.</p>
<p>5. NETD of 75 mK or smaller required - smallest value is best.</p>
<p>6. USB readout for fast frame rate output and post signal processing.</p>
<p>7. Integrated system software for camera control, image data collection and post processing.</p>
<p>8. Ability to accommodate external infrared lenses and filters with standard camera mounts.</p>
<p><br />NIST is seeking responses from all responsible sources, including large, foreign, and small businesses. Small businesses are defined under the associated NAICS code for this effort, 334516, as those domestic sources having 500 employees or less. Please include your company's size classification and socio-economic status in any response to this notice.</p>
<p>Companies that manufacture a Terahertz Imager are requested to email a detailed report describing their abilities to eric.bubar@nist.gov no later than the response date for this sources sought notice. The report should include achievable specifications and any other information relevant to your product or capabilities. Also, the following information is requested to be provided as part of the response to this sources sought notice:</p>
<p>1. Name of the company that manufactures the system components for which specifications are provided.</p>
<p>2. Name of company(ies) that are authorized to sell the system components, their addresses, and a point of contact for the company (name, phone number, fax number and email address).</p>
<p>3. Indication of number of days, after receipt of order that is typical for delivery of such systems.</p>
<p>4. Indication of whether each instrument for which specifications are sent to eric.bubar@nist.gov is currently on one or more GSA Federal Supply Schedule contracts and, if so, the GSA FSS contract number(s).</p>
<p>5. Any other relevant information that is not listed above which the Government should consider in developing its minimum specifications and finalizing its market research.</p>

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;">THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS, AN INVITATION FOR BIDS, OR A REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS. FURTHER, IT DOES NOT REPRESENT A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT TO PAY FOR COSTS INCURRED IN PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF DATA OR ANY OTHER COSTS INCURRED IN RESPONSE TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a Sources Sought Notice (PUR-13-0245) with the intent to award a sole source contract to the Chesapeake Defense Services, Inc., under the authority of FAR 13.106 based on their unique technical qualifications as the only known vendor that has the capability to provide the required scans, that is within the required locality requirement, and has the availability within the required timeframe to complete the scans. The Safety Board knows of no other sources capable of meeting the scanning requirement within the timeframe described below. Notice is provided as information to the marketplace, market research, and is an invitation for any other qualified companies to express their interest in and demonstrate their capability to provide services that performs the required work.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Background<br /></strong>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is an independent Federal agency with the primary missions of investigating civil aviation accidents in the United States and significant accidents in the other modes of transportation -- railroad, highway, marine and pipeline -- and issuing safety recommendations aimed at preventing future accidents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The NTSB is planning to conduct teardown examinations as soon as possible of several aircraft batteries similar to one involved in an aircraft incident. This urgent requirement is in support of accident investigation DCA13IA037 that occurred in Boston, MA. To facilitate those examinations, CT scans of these batteries and their subcomponents are required to non-destructively determine as much information as possible about those components. In addition, batteries and battery cells of the same type which have been subjected to known test conditions will also be scanned. These scans will be conducted both before and after the test conditions are applied. Since these batteries are of the lithium ion type and have substantial shipping restrictions (including a requirement for ground shipping only using specially qualified hazardous materials shippers which would cause a delay of several days to accommodate), these scans need to be conducted at a location close to Washington, D.C. to allow the NTSB to transport the battery to the contractor and thereby avoid shipping and other logistical complications. They must also be completed within the shortest timeframe possible to provide the fastest possible receipt of this information to avoid potential future accidents involving this type of aircraft battery. Since the FAA has recently approved a plan intended to result in the Boeing 787 being approved for a return to service, the information from these tests (and the CT scans required to support these tests) is needed as soon as possible. A scan report that documents items such as the x-ray source power used, x-ray focal spot size, detector used, integration time, number of views, image pixel size, slice thickness, total length scanned, number of slices, etc. is due no later than&nbsp;10 days after the end of the scanning activity. The NTSB has a requirement for CT scanning services to begin on 5/6/2013. Therefore, this requirement is urgent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The NTSB has a requirement for CT scans of eight (8) Boeing 787 batteries cells. In addition, the NTSB has a requirement for additional scanning work for up to 40 additional battery cells or their equivalent scanning effort to be used as needed at the discretion of the NTSB. The scanning work for the "up to 40 additional battery cells" will be conducted in two installments. The cells will first be scanned in a "before testing" configuration, and then scanned again after testing has been completed with the cells. Finally, the NTSB requires at least 2 digital radiographs per component (90 degrees apart).<br /><br /><strong>Required Services<br /></strong>1. Task Area 1 - Digital Radiograph (DR) of Component: The Contractor shall produce a DR of the component that shows the entire part or region of interest, as designated by the NTSB. The DR image shall be produced with the highest level of resolution possible, unless otherwise directed by the NTSB. The Contractor shall supply all parts and labor required to mount the component as required to be scanned in their equipment. <br /><br />2. Task Area 2 - Computed Tomography Scan of Component: The Contractor shall produce a CT scan of the component that shows the entire region of interest, as designated by the NTSB. CT scan images shall be produced with the smallest slice thickness and highest level of resolution as possible (consistent with producing the best possible images), unless otherwise directed by the NTSB. The images should be free of artifacts. The Contractor shall supply all parts and labor required to mount the component as required to be scanned in their equipment. <br /><br />3. Task Area 3 - Post Processing of Images: Post processing of images may or may not be required for each item to be scanned. The Contractor, upon direction from the NTSB, shall provide re-processed images showing zoomed areas, multi-planar reconstructed images, or other images as may be applicable.<br /><br /><strong>STANDARDS<br /></strong>All tasks shall be conducted on equipment that is maintained and calibrated on a schedule that is in accordance with best industry practices for radiological equipment. The safety procedures in place for all operations using this equipment shall comply with existing state and federal laws and guidelines governing radiological equipment. <br /><br /><strong>DELIVERABLES/DELIVERY SCHEDULE<br /></strong>1. Task Area 1 - Digital Radiograph (DR) of Component: Deliverables include DR images, in a TIFF format (unless otherwise directed by the NTSB). The images shall be provided immediately after the end of the scanning activities, unless otherwise directed by the COR.<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Task Area 2 - Computed Tomography Scan of Component: Deliverables include CT images (in a TIFF format unless otherwise directed by the NTSB) and field of view information that is sufficient to determine pixel sizes in the images. The images and field of view information shall be provided immediately after the end of the scanning activities, unless otherwise directed by the COR. <br /><br />3. Task Area 3 - Post Processing of Images: Post processing images shall be provided (in a TIFF format unless otherwise directed by the NTSB) within 5 days of the date on which the need for post-processing of images was determined. The post-processed images shall be accompanied by documentation, which is sufficient to explain what post-processing operations were applied to the original scanned images.<br /><br />4. Scan Reports: During performance of the work as described in Section C of the contract, the Contractor shall furnish one (1) copy of a letter-type Scan Report to the COR and one (1) copy to the Contract Administrator on or before 10 days after the end of the scanning activity. This scanning report should contain information sufficient to document the configuration of the equipment used to produce the scans. The information should include items such as the x-ray source power used, x-ray focal spot size, detector used, integration time, number of views, image pixel size, slice thickness, total length scanned, number of slices, etc.<br /><br /><strong>MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS<br /></strong>1. Equipment: All tasks shall be conducted on equipment that is maintained and calibrated on a schedule that is in accordance with best industry practices for radiological equipment. The safety procedures in place for all operations using this equipment shall comply with existing state and federal laws and guidelines governing radiological equipment. The Contractor shall provide standardized test results that demonstrate the capabilities of the equipment proposed as described in this contract. <br /><br />2.

The excavation for the bypass is approximately 1,400 feet long, and approximately 280-feet wide and 10 - 15 feet deep.  The bypass is stabilized with turf reinforced matting for the invert and the banks of the channel.  A concrete energy dissipater is located just downstream of the inlet of the channel within the invert.  <br>  <br> 2.	 Approximately 2,000 feet of reinforced concrete floodwalls are required along both banks. <br>  <br> 3.  The finished grade for the inlet of the bypass will be set at approximately the 2 1/2 year storm event.  Currently the area where the bypass would be constructed is at a higher elevation than the 2 1/2 year planned inflow. <br>  <br> 4.  Two existing traffic bridges and one railroad bridge cross the bypass and are not part of the project.  McKinstry Street crosses the project area and will require relocation to the bottom of the bypass.  Two flood control gates are planned at each end of McKinstry Street, which tie into the floodwalls. <br>  <br> 5.  A concrete low flow channel has been designed below the elevation of the invert of the bypass in order to direct interior flows to the Napa River in order to keep the invert of the bypass as dry as possible.  The low flow channel is approximately 900 feet in length and 30-feet wide. <br>  <br> CAPABILITY STATEMENT <br>  <br> The following requests are designed to apprise the US Army Corps of Engineers, Sacramento District, of any prospective construction contractors' project execution capabilities.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of a replacement camera (Basler A311f) for the Veeco NT 1100 Optical Profilometer System. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (a) (ii)
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 333314. Size standard is 500 employees. <br /><br />The proposed source is Bruker Nano Inc., 3400 E. Britannia Dr, Tucson, AZ 85706. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation, or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received within five (5) days of this notice. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) (formerly CCR) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 21 May 1998. You may contact SAM at 1-888-606-8220 or https://www.fsd.gov/.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">statement of the reason</span></strong></p>
<p>The Government requires a replacement camera (Basler A311f) for the Veeco NT 1100 Optical Profilometer System. Market research revealed that the A311f can be purchased from a number of distributors but that each camera is sold without any software/firmware loaded onto them and that it is up to the purchaser of each camera to load their own software/firmware for each specific application. The only known source that can meet the Government's requirement is Bruker Nano Inc.</p>
<p>Bruker Nano is the only company capable of providing the Basler A311f camera with compatible firmware, this procurement shall be a Sole Source</p>

<a href="mailto:marianne.shelley@nasa.gov">Marianne  Shelley</EMAIL></a>
<DESC>The Nanosatellite Launch Adapter System (NLAS) was developed at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC), Moffett Field, CA to increase access to space, while simplifying the integration process of miniature satellites, called Nanosats or Cubesats, onto launch vehicles.  A standard one-unit (1U) Cubesat measures about 4 inches (10 cm) long, 4 inches wide, and 4 inches high.  A single NLAS provides the capability to deploy 24U of Cubesats.  The system is designed to accommodate satellites measuring 1U, 1.5U, 2U, 3U and 6U sizes for deployment into orbit.  The NLAS may be configured for use on different launch vehicles. NLAS consists of an Adapter, four Dispensers and a Sequencer.	The Adapter is mounted between the lower surface of the launch vehicle and the primary mission spacecraft.  The Dispensers are mounted inside the Adapter and house a variety of Cubesats in fully enclosed bays.  Each Dispenser is reconfigurable and can contain either two 3U bays (where each 3U bay could be comprised of 3-1Us, 2-1.5Us, or a 1U plus a 2U), or a single 6U bay.  A Dispenser can accommodate a total payload weight of up to 30 pounds (14 kg).  To increase the number of secondary payloads, multiple NLAS can be stacked on a single launch vehicle.  The Sequencer is a self-powered reprogrammable unit that signals the separation actuator of each Dispenser bay, or other deployment mechanisms.  It also can trigger a second Sequencer in a daisy chain arrangement.  The Sequencer has inbuilt redundancy, error checking and noise rejection.  It is programmed using Ground Support Equipment (GSE) and a straightforward Graphical User Interface (GUI) on a computer.	NLAS is used by NASA, other government agencies and commercial entities. Eight NLAS Dispensers are manifested to launch Cubesats during 2013. A selection of NLAS photos are attached to this announcement. NASA ARC hopes that its NLAS Dispenser design for deploying up to 6U of Cubesats will be the future standard for use in Cubesat missions.  To further that goal, NASA ARC expects to release to members of the Cubesat community the basic NLAS Dispenser design and build-to drawings package in the August 2013 timeframe.  The design will be released to potentially all International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) -compliant fabricators who request it from NASA ARC.  ARC may also provide the current interface design document (IDD) for the NLAS Dispenser upon receipt of your ITAR-compliance information, see item 5 below. In addition, NASA ARC may discuss licensing of the NLAS Sequencer that was designed to command multiple NLAS Dispensers, or the NLAS Adapter that can hold up to four (4) Dispensers (an evolved commercial version is also currently available).  Please contact NASA ARC if your organization is interested in extending or modifying the current NLAS Dispenser design. To be considered for receipt of this information and/or data, please submit the following information by email to the Spaceflight Projects Office POC contact below: 1.	Company/ Organization name 2.	Address 3.	Name of technical point of contact, email/ phone 4.	Discussion of companys/ organizations technical background and capabilities 5.	Discussion of companys/organizations ITAR compliance status.	Is company registered with the US Department of States Directorate of Defense Trade Controls? (http://pmddtc.state.gov/registration/index.html   )  Are any non-US persons employed by the organization?  The U.S. Government requires all manufacturers, exporters, and brokers of defense articles, defense services or related technical data to be ITAR compliant. The decision by NASA to provide or to not provide this information and/or data to any organization who requests it is solely at the discretion of NASA. Note:  This is only a special notice and does not constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that NASA ARC will take procurement action in this matter.  Further, neither NASA ARC nor the Government will be responsible for any cost incurred in furnishing this information.  All information received in response to this notice that is marked Proprietary will be handled and protected accordingly.  As applicable, NASA will likely provide Proprietary information to its support service contractors who are under an obligation to keep third-party Proprietary information in confidence.  By submitting a response to this notice, the responder is deemed to have consented to release of Proprietary information to such NASA support service contractors.

<DESC>The Department Of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA), intends to award a sole source firm-fixed price contract award on a noncompetitive basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1(a) (2) "Only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements" to T-Mobile USA, Inc., 12920 Southeast 38th Street Belvue, WA 98006-1350 The service is to provide DoDEA with voice and data plans for its existing Blackberry devices. PSC is D304, NAICS Code is 517210, and Size standard is 1500 Employees.
<p>The sole source determination is based upon T-Mobile USA Inc. being the only source able to complete to provide the required telecommunications services for DoDEA's existing locked Blackberry devices. These devices will not operate on any other telecommunications networks and the cost of procuring new devices would be cost prohibitive and duplicative to the Government.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals. Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses to this electronic notice must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on 5/20/13. Responses may be submitted by E-mail to Matt Schulz: matthew.schulz@hq.dodea.edu</p>

<p>Proposed Establishment of a Federally Funded Research and <br />Development Center-First Notice</p>
<p>AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology, Department of <br />Commerce.</p>
<p>ACTION: Notice.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>SUMMARY: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), <br />Department of Commerce, intends to sponsor a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC) to facilitate public-private collaboration for accelerating the widespread adoption of integrated cybersecurity tools and technologies. This is the first of three notices which must be published over a 90-day period in order to advise the public of the agency's intention to sponsor an FFRDC.  This notice is not a solicitation, and is purely informational.</p>
<p>DATES: Written comments must be received by 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on <br />July 22, 2013.</p>
<p>ADDRESSES: Comments on this notice must be received by Keith Bubar, <br />Contracting Officer, National Institute of Standards and Technology, <br />100 Bureau Drive, Mailstop 1640, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, including by <br />email to Mr. Bubar at keith.bubar@nist.gov.</p>
<p>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Keith Bubar via email at <br />Keith.Bubar@nist.gov or telephone 301.975.8329.</p>
<p>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Cybersecurity Center of <br />Excellence (NCCoE), hosted by NIST, is a public-private collaboration <br />for accelerating the widespread adoption of integrated cybersecurity <br />tools and technologies. The NCCoE will bring together experts from <br />industry, government, and academia under one roof to develop practical, <br />interoperable cybersecurity approaches that address the real world <br />needs of complex Information Technology (IT) systems. By accelerating <br />dissemination and use of these integrated tools and technologies for <br />protecting IT assets, the NCCoE will enhance trust in U.S. IT <br />communications, data, and storage systems, lower risk for companies and <br />individuals in the use of IT systems, and encourage development of <br />innovative, job-creating cybersecurity products and services.<br /> <br />NIST has identified the need to support the NCCoE's mission through <br />the establishment of an FFRDC. In evaluating the need for the FFRDC, <br />NIST determined that no existing FFRDC or contract vehicles provide the <br />scope of services NIST requires. The proposed NCCoE FFRDC will have <br />three primary purposes: (1) Research, Development, Engineering, and <br />Technical support; (2) Program/Project Management, to include but not <br />limited to expert advice and guidance in the areas of program and <br />project management focused on increasing the effectiveness and <br />efficiency of cybersecurity applications, prototyping, demonstrations, <br />and technical activities; and (3) Facilities Management.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
<p>AIRBORNE TACTICAL IMAGING SENSORS STANDARDIZATION<br />The Naval Air Systems Command Patuxent River, MD has been standardizing interfaces between electro-optic systems and their host platforms. The goal of the Sensor Platform Interface Engineering Standards (SPIES) effort is to improve the affordability and interoperability of electro-optic sensors on Naval Aviation platforms by establishing a common, standard interface for their acquisition, development, integration, test, and operation. This initiative is expected to reduce acquisition costs and further promote and enable open architecture objectives.</p>
<p>As part of this previous now completed effort, NAVAIR has worked via Society of Automobile Engineering (SAE) to produce four standards:</p>
<p>&bull; SAE AS6129 (Electrical) http://standards.sae.org/as6129/<br />&bull; SAE AS6135 (Data) http://standards.sae.org/as6135/<br />&bull; SAE AS6165 (Maintenance and Test) http://standards.sae.org/as6165/<br />&bull; SAE AS6169 (Mechanical) http://standards.sae.org/as6169/</p>
<p>NAVAIR 4.5.6 is now interested in the possibility of acquiring one or several Electro-Optic/Infra-Red (EO/IR) turreted sensors that have been made to specifications indicated in the above four standards (specifically to SAE AS6129 (Electrical) SAE AS6135 (Data) SAE AS6165 (Maintenance and Test) and SAE AS6169 (Mechanical)). We are requesting additional information and cost approximations from industry on turrets that have or could be modified to incorporate the SPIES standards indicated.</p>
<p>The above standards separate turrets into four different classes (sizes). Please include notional cost data for a turret from each class available from your aerospace product line including cost to convert to a SPIES-compliant configuration. The turrets will be initially used in a Systems Integration Lab (SIL) to demonstrate the sensor standards. After completion of the SIL research, we intend to fly this turret in a flight test environment. All proposed equipment, for this reason, must be flight qualified and able to achieve flight certification.</p>
<p>The goal of this RFI is to explore the technical aspects of the components of this requirement. The Government is seeking industry input to assist in identifying features and approaches to meet the general requirements described within. Please note that the Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties responding to this RFI. THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Interested sources should provide this sensor information and related data to Ms. Jillian Kohler, jillian.kohler@navy.mil no later than 30 days (with the preference being sooner) after the post date of this RFI. All information sent should reference this RFI number on the subject response line of the emailed response as well as on all enclosed documents. Responses must include the company name, address, point of contact name and email/phone, and company size. Proprietary data MUST be marked on a page-by-page basis and will be kept confidential and protected where so designated. <br /><br />Responders to this RFI will form the basis for planning and budgetary purposes and potential acquisition of a SPIES compatible EO/IR Turret.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Systems Command is requesting information to assist in forming a potential future procurement in no smaller than 10 pt font .</p>
<p>1. By your own independent analysis, what approach do you feel is the most cost-effective way to procure an Electro-Optic/Infra-Red turreted sensor that conforms to SAE AS6129 (Electrical) SAE AS6135 (Data) SAE AS6165 (Maintenance and Test) and SAE AS6169 (Mechanical) (referenced SAE standards which can be obtained from SAE (see above links). <br />2. Please provide an estimate/rough order of magnitude (ROM) on an approximate cost for the proposed acquisition defined in (1.).</p>
<p>Technical questions and industry responses to this RFI shall be submitted via email no later than 4:00PM EST 03 June 2013 to the following individuals:</p>
<p>Ms. Jillian Kohler at jillian.kohler@navy.mil</p>

<DESC>**Please note this is not a solicitation***<br /><br />The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) intends to contract using other than full and open competition for its Operations and Maintenance for the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA). Accordingly, the TSA intends to award a contract to InfoZen Inc., 9420 Key West Avenue Suite 101, Rockville, MD 20850. This contract extension will continue to address the requirements of the Office of Intelligence and Analysis for the deployment, implementation, operation, and maintenance of a broad range of transportation vetting programs designed to protect the U.S. Transportation system against terrorism and threats to National Security.

<p>The contemplated extension will be for a three (3) month base period and three (3) one month option periods to support the continuous, uninterrupted service to the OIA operating and computing environment to allow for transition from incumbent to a new vendor, if necessary, as well as allow adequate time for any unforeseen delays. The contemplated period of performance (including options) would begin on May 28th, 2013 and could continue through November 27th, 2013.</p>
<p>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received thirty days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. The Government will notify parties of the outcome of any proposal submitted in response. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.<br /><br />Interested vendors who may wish to seek subcontracting opportunities should contact the above named company directly.</p>

The Upper Midwest Environmental Sciences Center (UMESC) is an ecological research office and laboratory complex.  UMESC was originally constructed and occupied during the period of 1975 thru 1978, and initially consisted of three interconnected building segments (designated A, B, and C), each with two levels (upper, lower).  Segment C was constructed and occupied first, in 1975; Segments A and B, along with the connections between A and B and between B and C, were completed and occupied in 1978.  The exterior walls of all segments were constructed of 8 thick, pre-cast, insulated concrete sandwich panels.  Most of the interior partitions are painted, structural load bearing concrete masonry units (CMUs).  Some of the office partitions are finished, gypsum board walls. A fourth building segment (D) was constructed and occupied in 2010-2012 but is outside the scope of this project.

Vendors can comply with the rule by using either of the two methods below:
1.	The FSC uses a third-party contractor, OB10, to transition vendors from paper to electronic invoice submission.  For information on OB10 electronic invoicing set-up, vendors should call 877-752-0900, or email USClientServices@ob10.com . 2.	A system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) format established by the Accredited Standards Center.  For FSC e-Invoicing information, please call 877-353-9791 or email vafsccshd@va.gov.
FSC and VA?s Office of Acquisition, Logistics and Construction (OALC) will assist existing commercial vendors in migrating to the electronic process.  Until the transition to electronic format is complete, FSC will continue to process paper invoices for commercial vendors. 
The FSC?s electronic invoicing system provides a variety of flexible solutions for all vendor types, including small businesses, and does not require any vendor transaction fees.  More information on the FSC electronic invoicing process can be found at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp. <BR> <BR>

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability.

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection.

This notice, when delivered to the Contractor or the Contractor?s representative at the work site, shall be deemed sufficient notice of the noncompliance and that corrective action is required. After receiving the notice, the Contractor shall immediately take corrective action. If the Contractor fails or refuses to promptly take corrective action, the Contracting Officer may issue an order stopping all or part of the work until satisfactory corrective action has been taken. The Contractor shall not be entitled to any equitable adjustment of the contract price or extension of the performance schedule on any stop work order issued under this clause.

(End of Local Clause) <BR> <BR>11.701 -- Supply Contracts. (a) A fixed-price supply contract may authorize Government acceptance of a variation in the quantity of items called for if the variation is caused by conditions of loading, shipping, or packing, or by allowances in manufacturing processes. Any permissible variation shall be stated as a percentage and it may be an increase, a decrease, or a combination of both; however, contracts for subsistence items may use other applicable terms of variation in quantity.
(b) There should be no standard or usual variation percentage. The overrun or underrun permitted in each contract should be based upon the normal commercial practices of a particular industry for a particular item, and the permitted percentage should be no larger than is necessary to afford a contractor reasonable protection. The permissible variation shall not exceed plus or minus 10 percent unless a different limitation is established in agency regulations. Consideration shall be given to the quantity to which the percentage variation applies. For example, when delivery will be made to multiple destinations and it is desired that the quantity variation apply to the item quantity for each destination, this requirement must be stated in the contract.
(c) Contractors are responsible for delivery of the specified quantity of items in a fixed-price contract, within allowable variations, if any. If a contractor delivers a quantity of items in excess of the contract requirements plus any allowable variation in quantity, particularly small dollar value overshipments, it results in unnecessary administrative costs to the Government in determining disposition of the excess quantity. Accordingly, the contract may include the clause at 52.211-17, Delivery of Excess Quantities, to provide that --
(1) Excess quantities of items totaling up to $250 in value may be retained without compensating the contractor; and
(2) Excess quantities of items totaling over $250 in value may, at the Government?s option,  -- Please refer to FedBid for complete list of contract requirement(s) and terms and conditions. <BR> <BR>

(2) "Confidential commercial or financial information" means any business information (other than trade secrets) which is exempt from the mandatory disclosure requirement of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. Exemptions from mandatory disclosure which may be applicable to business information contained in proposals include exemption (4), which covers "commercial and financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential," and exemption (9), which covers "geological and geophysical information, including maps, concerning wells." (b) If the offeror, or its subcontractor(s), believes that the proposal contains trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), the cover page of each copy of the proposal shall be marked with the following legend: "The information specifically identified on pages ______ of this proposal constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. The offeror requests that this information not be disclosed to the public, except as may be required by law. The offeror also requests that this information not be used in whole or part by the government for any purpose other than to evaluate the proposal, except that if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with the submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information to the extent provided in the contract." (c) The offeror shall also specifically identify trade secret information and confidential commercial and financial information on the pages of the proposal on which it appears and shall mark each such page with the following legend: "This page contains trade secrets or confidential commercial and financial information which the offeror believes to be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act and which is subject to the legend contained on the cover page of this proposal. (d) Information in a proposal identified by an offeror as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information shall be used by the Government only for the purpose of evaluating the proposal, except that (i) if a contract is awarded to the offeror as a result of or in connection with submission of the proposal, the Government shall have the right to use the information as provided in the contract, and (ii) if the same information is obtained from another source without restriction it may be used without restriction. <BR> <BR>(e) If a request under the Freedom of Information Act seeks access to information in a proposal identified as trade secret information or confidential commercial and financial information, full consideration will be given to the offeror's view that the information constitutes trade secrets or confidential commercial or financial information. The offeror will also be promptly notified of the request and given an opportunity to provide additional evidence and argument in support of its position, unless administratively unfeasible to do so. If it is determined that information claimed by the offeror to be trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, the offeror will be notified of this determination prior to disclosure of the information.

However, failure of an offeror to mark information contained in a proposal as trade secret information or confidential commercial or financial information will be treated by the Government as evidence that the information is not exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, absent a showing that the failure to mark was due to unusual or extenuating circumstances, such as a showing that the offeror had intended to mark, but that markings were omitted from the offeror's proposal due to clerical error. <BR> <BR>(a) Any system hardware, software, firmware and/or networked component (voice, video or data) developed, procured, or acquired in support and/or performance of this contract shall be capable of transmitting, receiving, processing, forwarding and storing digital information across system boundaries utilizing system packets that are formatted in accordance with commercial standards of Internet Protocol (IP) version 6 (IPv6) as set forth in the IJSGv6 Profile (KIST Special Publication 500-267) and corresponding declarations of conformance defined in the USGv6 Test Program.

<p>(viii) EVALUATION OF PROPOSALS</p>
<p>Award shall be made to the lowest priced, technically acceptable offeror.</p>
<p>The Government will evaluate proposals based on the following evaluation criteria: A) Technical Capability; B) Past Performance and C) Price.</p>
<p>Price shall not be evaluated on proposals that are determined technically unacceptable in accordance with the Technical Evaluation factors.</p>
<p>Evaluation of Options: In accordance with FAR Provision 52.217-5, Evaluation of Options, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement, except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>A) TECHNICAL CAPABILITY: Provide two (2) completed projects performed in the past three (3) years similar to the size and scope of this requirement. Provide the name, dollar amount, period of performance, and description of each project submitted.</p>
<p>B) PAST PERFORMANCE: The offeror's past performance information will be evaluated subsequent to the technical evaluation. However, this evaluation will not be conducted on any offeror whose proposal is determined to be technically unacceptable.</p>
<p>The evaluation will be based on information obtained from references provided by the offeror, other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government, and any information supplied by the offeror concerning problems encountered on the identified contracts and corrective action taken.</p>
<p>The government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror. Performance risks are those associated with an offeror's likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror's record of past performance.</p>
<p>The assessment of performance risk is not intended to be a product of a mechanical or mathematical analysis of an offeror's performance on a list of contracts but rather the product of subjective judgment by the Government after it considers relevant information.</p>
<p>When assessing performance risks, the Government will focus on the past performance of the offeror as it relates to all acquisition requirements, such as the offeror's record of performing according to specifications, including standards of good workmanship; the offeror's record of controlling and forecasting costs; the offeror's adherence to contract schedules, including the administrative aspects of performance; the offeror's reputation for reasonable and cooperative behavior and commitment to customer satisfaction; and generally, the offeror's business-like concern for the interest of the customer.</p>
<p>The Government will consider the currency and relevance of the information, source of the information, context of the data, and general trends in the offeror's performance.</p>
<p>The lack of a relevant performance record may result in an unknown performance risk assessment, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror.</p>
<p>C) Price: An evaluation of the offeror's price quote will be made to determine if proposed prices are realistic for the work to be performed, reflect a clear understanding of the requirements, and are consistent with the technical proposal. Reasonableness determinations will be made by determining if competition exists, by comparing proposed prices with established commercial or GSA price schedules (if applicable), and/or by comparing proposed prices with the Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE).<br />(ix) In accordance with FAR clause 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items, offerors must complete annual representations and certifications on-line at http://orca.bpn.gov.

(Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) o Are, o are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) o Are, o are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) o Have, o have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract.

<p>Offerors that are newly formed entities or otherwise lack relevant prior contracts should list contracts and subcontracts. Resumes are required for all key personnel and applicable resources to be used in the effort being offered (where is or may not be easily apparent, also explain the relevancy of the past performance). Offerors are encouraged to describe any problems encountered and corrective actions taken on the identified contracts. NOAA reserves the right to obtain information for use in evaluating past performance from any all sources, including sources outside the Government.</p>
<p>(b) Price quotes must generally adhere to the pricing structure established in the Schedule of Items. Each offeror's price proposal must be based on the offeror's own technical proposal, the Government's statement/scope of work, and other contractual requirements. If the prices to be used are based on a published price list, or catalog, the offeror shall so state, and provide a copy of the document with their price proposal.

Overtime shall be paid in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act and other applicable labor laws.</p>
<p>(IX) FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition. The Government will award one contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible offeror on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of quotes meeting or exceeding the acceptable standards for non-price factors, stated in the Performance Work Statement, Attachment I of this solicitation. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Technical Capability, Past Performance and Price.</p>
<p>TECHNICAL CAPABILITY EVALUATION: <br />Offerors will be evaluated on their proposed technical approach and how they plan to meet the specified requirements, along with proof of required certifications/licenses, and resumes of proposed Key Personnel.</p>
<p>PAST PERFORMANCE EVALUATION: <br />The Government will conduct a performance assessment based on the quality of the past performance of the Contractor on similar contracts as it relates to the probability of successful accomplishment of the required effort. Information utilized may be obtained from the references listed in the proposal, other customers known to the Government, and/or others who may have useful and relevant information. The Offeror's past performance on related contracts will be evaluated to determine, as appropriate, successful performance of contract requirements, quality and timeliness of delivery of goods and services, effective management of subcontractors, cost management, level of communication between the contracting parties, proactive management and customer satisfaction. <br />The Government reserves the right to assess the past performance of proposed subcontractors, if applicable.</p>
<p>The Government will use its discretion to determine the sources of past performance information used in the evaluation, and the information may be obtained from references provided by the Offeror, the agency's knowledge of contractor performance, other Government agencies or commercial entities, or past performance databases. For example, the SSEB may review the National Upper-Air Station Performance Scores that are used by the National Weather Service to evaluate upper air station performance nationwide with respect to data availability, quantity and quality. Offeror's scores will be reviewed carefully. Conditions outside the contractor's control, such as equipment and communication failures requiring maintenance performance by the managing NWS Weather Forecast Office electronic and engineering staff will be taken into consideration when evaluating station scores.</p>
<p>If an Offeror does not have a history of relevant contract experience, or if past performance information is not available, the Offeror will receive a neutral past performance rating; it will not harm or help a contractor's chance of award.</p>
<p>(b) "Options." The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award. <br />(End of Provision)</p>
<p>2. BASIS FOR PRICE EVALAUTION <br />Pricing will be reviewed for fair and reasonableness. Evaluation of offer(s) will be in accordance with FAR Part 12.602, FAR Part 13.106, and as prescribed in FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation - Commercial Items.</p>
<p>3. FAR 52.217-5 EVALUATION OF OPTIONS (JULY 1990) <br />Except when it is determined in accordance with FAR 17.206(b) not to be in the Government's best interests, the Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. Evaluation of options will not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(X) The offeror must submit a completed copy ATTACHMENT III, the provision at FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items (DEC 2012), with its proposal.

The offeror shall complete the annual representations and certifications electronically at the SAM website (www.sam.gov).</p>
<p>(XI) The clause at FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items (FEB 2012), applies to this acquisition.</p>
<p>(XII) The clause at FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required to Implement Statutes or Executive Orders - Commercial Items (JAN 2013) applies to this acquisition. For a list of the specific subparagraphs in FAR 52.212-5 that apply to this acquisition, refer to Attachment V, Applicable Clauses and Provisions.</p>
<p>(XIII) For a list of additional FAR and Department of Commerce clauses and provisions that apply to this acquisition, refer to Attachment V, other Applicable Provisions &amp; Clauses. <br /><br />(XIV) This acquisition is not rated by the Defense Priorities and Allocations System (DPAS).</p>

<p><br />II. STATEMENT OF WORK</p>

<p>1.0.1 Contractor must comply with all applicable Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulations, Federal rules and regulations and the Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations.</p>
<p>1.0.2 The Contractor must be responsible for making all the arrangements with the appropriate authorities to transport radioactive materials. The contractor shall also supply all equipment directly related to the source handling, ex. Positioning devices, shipping casks, remote handlers, lead steel containers, and lead brick shielding necessary for performing all work on-site at AFRRI. <br />1.0.3 The Contractor must possess a current NRC approved Department of Transportation (DOT) Quality Assurance Program to package and transport the requested source material (equal to or greater than that of the new source).</p>
<p>1.0.4 The Contractor must be licensed by the NRC to receive, possess, remove, use, transfer, ship or dispose of radioactive materials.</p>
<p>1.0.5 The Contractor will provide on-site training and two sets of the technical manuals.</p>
<p>1.0.6 Contractor must work in coordination with USUHS and AFRRI to execute requirements and meet the standards identified within this SOW.<br /><br />1.0.7 Under the DoD 5200.2, DoD Personnel Security Program, AFRRI is a secured building. All Contractors' personnel will adhere to AFRRI security requirements and meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>a. A National Agency Check is required to enter the building without escort.<br />b. A radiation safety briefing will be mandatory for all contractor personnel prior to the start of work.<br />c. All contractor personnel must wear dosimeters (a radiation exposure detection device) at all times in the radiation source area. <br />d. All contractor personnel must have American citizenship and valid identification to enter and work within the facility.</p>
<p>2.0 Technical Task: The contractor shall accomplish the following tasks to comply with this statement of work (SOW). In addition, the only authorized sealed source is 100 curies per source and 100 curies total. The Government is not requesting any other source encapsulations. A license amendment will not be granted.</p>
<p>2.1. Design and Build</p>
<p>2.1.1 The existing J.L. Shepherd Model 81 Panoramic Irradiator must be fitted with a pair of removable attenuators (X-2 and X-4) to allow for a range of dose rate irradiations while utilizing a single Co-60 source. The attenuators shall be made of lead and encased in stainless steel. The attenuators must be removable so that AFRRI can interchange between the unattenuated source, the source with the X-2 attenuator in place, and the source with the X-4 attenuator in place. The attenuators must shield the source in the entire 360 degree panoramic field.</p>
<p>2.1.2 A new 100 Ci Co-60 source with shielded source rod to fit the existing J.L. Shepherd Model 81 Panoramic Irradiator must be provided. The AFRRI license does not permit a higher activity source, therefore the source must not exceed 100 Ci on the delivery date. The existing Co-60 source rod assembly may be removed for disassembly and refit with the new Co-60 source. However, the contractor must coordinate the down time to minimize the impact on operations. In addition, the contractor must take possession of the source on their license, as our AFRRI license does not permit removal and use of the source off-site.</p>
<p>2.2 Installation</p>
<p>2.2.1 The contractor shall deliver and install the attenuators for the existing J.L. Shepherd Model 81Panoramic Irradiator. Contractor must obtain all required welding permits, licenses, and other documentation. The contractor must train AFRRI staff on the procedure for installing and removing the attenuators on the irradiator.</p>
<p>2.2.2 The contractor shall deliver and install the 100 Ci source and shielded source rod. The contractor shall perform source calibrations. Instrumentation used to calibrate the source must be certified. The new source shall be recognized by the NRC and shall be certified and approved sealed sources and devices.</p>
<p>2.3 Source Removal<br />2.3.1 The contractor shall remove and take possession of the existing Co-60 source in accordance with NRC regulations. Information regarding this source provided upon request. <br />3.0 Facility Dimensions<br />The low-level cobalt irradiation room is approximately 40 ft. x 33 ft. with a 16 ft. ceiling. The entry door is approximately 9 ft. x 9 ft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

To remain registered in the CCR database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the CCR database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the CCR does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. <br />(2)(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, "doing business as" name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in FAR Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to (A) change the name in the CCR database; (B) comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12; and (C) agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. <br />The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. <br />(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the CCR information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. <br />(3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the CCR record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the CCR database. Information provided to the Contractor's CCR record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. <br />(4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via CCR accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov or by calling 1-888-227-2423 or 269-961-5757.</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Phillip.A.Will@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>10. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 08MAY13 0930 Pacific Time.</p>

<p>7. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is (202).372-3695.</p>
<p>8. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Brenda.l.lentz@uscg.mil Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>
<p>9. Quotations shall be submitted not later than 11:00 Pacific Time on May 20, 2013.</p>

<p>The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms that are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide technical assistance for the definition of the IT strategy and infrastructure requirements for the Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics (LADOL) Integrated Logistics Free Zone Enterprise ("Grantee").</p>
<p>LADOL has become the first and only base specifically designed to meet the logistical and engineering needs of Nigeria's deep water offshore industry. As the company prepares to expand its business operations, it must invest in a flexible, expandable, and integrated information technology (IT) infrastructure to enable management, tracking, and audit of all transactions with its clients, between its departments, and with the Nigerian government. This electronic management platform will also facilitate asset tracking and identity management at LADOL's base.<br /><br />The objective of the technical assistance is to develop over-arching information architecture for electronic management of the Grantee, integrating best practices from complex organizations and global firms, the Grantee's strategic objectives, and IT sector development analysis. The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $220,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).</p>
<p>A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and portions of a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901. To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to:<br /><br /><a href="https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp">https://www.ustda.gov/businessopps/rfpform.asp</a><br /><br />Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009. In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number. Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response. Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP. Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored. Please check your internal fax verification receipt. Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification. Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day. Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day. Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.</p>
<p>Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity. Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity. All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country. The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount. Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.</p>
<p>Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2:00PM local (Lagos, Nigeria) time, June 30, 2013</span></strong> at the above address. Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP. Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted. The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals. The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project. The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.</p>

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals? (1) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; (2) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; (3) [ ] Are, [ ] are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <BR> <BR>(4) [ ] Have, [ ] have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. (i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: (A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. (ii) Examples. (A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. ?6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code). (i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. (B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. ?6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. ?6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. (D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. ?362 (the Bankruptcy Code).

Any permissible variation shall be stated as a percentage and it may be an increase, a decrease, or a combination of both; however, contracts for subsistence items may use other applicable terms of variation in quantity.
(b) There should be no standard or usual variation percentage. The overrun or underrun permitted in each contract should be based upon the normal commercial practices of a particular industry for a particular item, and the permitted percentage should be no larger than is necessary to afford a contractor reasonable protection. The permissible variation shall not exceed plus or minus 10 percent unless a different limitation is established in agency regulations. Consideration shall be given to the quantity to which the percentage variation applies. For example, when delivery will be made to multiple destinations and it is desired that the quantity variation apply to the item quantity for each destination, this requirement must be stated in the contract.
(c) Contractors are responsible for delivery of the specified quantity of items in a fixed-price contract, within allowable variations, if any. If a contractor delivers a quantity of items in excess of the contract requirements plus any allowable variation in quantity, particularly small dollar value overshipments, it results in unnecessary administrative costs to the Government in determining disposition of the excess quantity. Accordingly, the contract may include the clause at 52.211-17, Delivery of Excess Quantities, to provide that --

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Authority. The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>Contracting Officer's Representative (COR) (APR 2010) (a) ___________ is hereby designated as the Contracting Officer's Representative (COR). The COR may be changed at any time by the Government without prior notice to the contractor by a unilateral modification to the contract. The COR is located at: ____________________ ____________________ ____________________ Phone Number:____________________ E-mail:____________________ (b) The responsibilities and limitations of the COR are as follows: (1) The COR is responsible for the technical aspects of the contract and serves as technical liaison with the contractor. The COR is also responsible for the final inspection and acceptance of all deliverables and such other responsibilities as may be specified in the contract. (2) The COR is not authorized to make any commitments or otherwise obligate the Government or authorize any changes which affect the contract price, terms or conditions. Any contractor request for changes shall be referred to the Contracting Officer directly or through the COR. No such changes shall be made without the express written prior authorization of the Contracting Officer. The Contracting Officer may designate assistant or alternate COR(s) to act for the COR by naming such assistant/alternate(s) in writing and transmitting a copy of such designation to the contractor. <BR> <BR>Insert the clause 1352.209?73, Compliance with the Laws, in all solicitations and contracts. As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(c), insert the following clause: Compliance With the Laws (APR 2010) The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>As prescribed in 48 CFR 1309.507?2(d), insert the following clause: Organizational Conflict of Interest (APR 2010) (a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities.

<DESC>THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO CHANGE THE # OF LABOR HOURS ESTIMATED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS REQUIREMENT AND CHANGE THE QUOTATION RESPONSE DEADLINE.<br /><br />This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial service prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6 Streamlined Procedures for Evaluation and Solicitation for Commercial Items, and FAR Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This solicitation is being issued as a Request for Quotations (RFQ) NIHLM2013664. This solicitation document incorporates provisions and clauses that are in effect through FAC 2005-66 FAR Revision effective February 28, 2013, including all FAR Circulars issued as of the date of this synopsis. This acquisition is a Total Small Business Set-Aside and the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 519190, Other Scientific and Technical Consulting Services.
<p>This is a firm-fixed-price contract and it is anticipated that an award will be made for a base year and two option years.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND<br />This project relates to the continued building, updating, and maintenance of LactMed, a searchable database of records on drugs and their use during lactation. LactMed is an addition to the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP). Although TEHIP databases currently provide some information on drug pharmacology and toxicology, efforts are underway to enhance TEHIP with even greater information on the pharmacology and toxicology of drugs and related products. Drug information is an integral component of a comprehensive toxicology program, and expanded coverage complements existing chemical substance and other data records. The LactMed database is accessible through TOXNET, an Internet-based system for TEHIP online databases (http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov), and is linked with other databases such as the Hazardous Substances Data Bank which has about 1,000 drug-related records.</p>
<p>The LactMed database was created, and needs to continue to evolve, because information available to healthcare providers is usually derived from approved drug product labeling, which often differs from expert opinion. Of the relatively few sources of information on this subject, such labeling typically does not provide critical evaluations of the primary literature. An evidence-based, comprehensive database on drugs and lactation made available in the public domain, LactMed was designed to help support medical decision-making by healthcare professionals. The database is evidence-based with source attribution, and made available in the public domain. LactMed complements the suite of databases that comprise TOXNET, which is maintained by the Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division of NLM. Database records are linked, where appropriate, to other TOXNET and NLM database records. In order to ensure consistency and data currency, the Contractor will continue to build the database over the duration specified in this purchase order. The database is written primarily for healthcare professionals with recommendations written at a level that is understandable to consumers.</p>
<p>PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE OF THE PROCUREMENT<br />The purpose of this project is to continue to expand and enhance LactMed, a database on possible adverse effects of prescription and nonprescription<br />drugs, relevant herbals, nutraceuticals, and diagnostic agents in infants that result from transmission during human breast-feeding.</p>
<p>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS<br />Compile the world's professional and scientific literature relating to the use of drugs and related products during human lactation. Organize this literature into a professionally acceptable system for ease of access to articles on specific drugs and, where appropriate, classes of pharmacologic and/or therapeutic agents. Drug names should be at the generic level and include, at a minimum, United States Adopted Names. Further, the Contractor must be willing to have such data placed in the public domain, without any intellectual property right constraints or fees imposed with respect to its use. While the database will become the property of NLM, this will not preclude the Contractor from reconfiguring or otherwise using the source data for preparing other information products or publications. The database content must be fully supported by an evidence-based approach that involves critical case evaluations of reports in peer-reviewed literature. The database needs to be a principal focus of the Contractor who has both the subject expertise and resources to accomplish this project expeditiously.</p>
<p>At a minimum, database records should include the drug names specified above, drug class(es), pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic data such as drug concentrations in breast milk and infant serum, time course of such levels, and weight-adjusted percent of maternal dose in breast milk. When it can be determined from case report evaluations and other analyses of published literature, provide possible drug effects on maternal lactation and in breast-fed infants, indicating a quantifiable probable causation. Information should also be provided with respect to those drugs that present no safety problems where published literature specifically makes that determination. All drug data within records must follow the approved drug record template at http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/help/LactMedRecordFormat.htm, and be referenced to available source references. There is no travel necessary for this requirement.</p>
<p>Specific tasks include a comprehensive review of the literature for each substance entry edited or newly created. This will involve online searching of NLM and other databases for citations, evaluating the information and incorporating what is relevant into the appropriate LactMed records. The uploading of these records will be accomplished utilizing SIS' SSEUS data entry system. These updated and new records will be further reviewed by the LactMed COR before public release. User inquiries related to the database and received by SIS are typically routed to the COR, who will reply directly or refer more complex ones to the Contractor for reply.</p>
<p>PROJECT DELIVERABLES<br />A monthly status report is required. This information, including the number of records uploaded, the dates, and the nature of the changes and additions will be available via the SSEUS system LEVEL OF EFFORT<br /><br />Annual Labor Hour Estimate for LactMed Database<br /><br />1.Direct Labor (Creating New Records): 100 hours <br />2.Direct Labor (Maintenance of Existing Records): 250 hours <br />3.Direct Labor (Uploading Records to Database) = 40 hours <br />4.Direct Labor (Answering user queries) = 10 hours</p>
<p>508 COMPLIANCE<br />Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act requires agencies' electronic and information technology be accessible to people with disabilities. The LactMed data must be Section 508 compliant. Specifically, the end product must be conformant with all applicable provisions, including:<br /><br />1194.41 Information, documentation, and support<br />This provision can be found at http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/standards.htm<br /><br />NLM follows HHS' Section 508 Documentation Compliance Checklists<br />http://www.hhs.gov/web/508/checklists/index.html<br /><br />Section 508 Program Need<br />Requirements for accessibility based on Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d) are determined to be relevant for the LactMed database requirement.</p>
<p>Section 508 Product Requirements<br />Information, documentation, and support requirements from 36 CFR part 1194 Subpart D have been determined to apply to this acquisition. Solicitation respondents must describe how the information, documentation, and support proposed for Electronic and Information Technology (EIT) deliverables meet at least the information, documentation, and support requirement identified as applicable in the attached Government Product/Service Accessibility Template (GPAT).<br /><br />Section 508 Evaluation Factors<br />Responses to the solicitation will only be considered for award after it has been determined that the proposal adequately addresses the requirements for Section 508. Only proposals which contain adequate information to document their responsiveness to the Section 508 requirements (e.g. a completed GPAT and supporting documentation) will be eligible for any additional merit consideration.<br /><br />Section 508 Acceptance Criteria<br />The monthly status report, a deliverable which is part of this solicitation will be accepted based in part on satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility. The proposals for the LactMed data must include a GPAT, which is included as a part of the solicitation.<br /><br />EVALUATION CRITERIA<br />After satisfaction of identified Section 508 requirements for accessibility, the evaluation will be based on the demonstrated capabilities of the perspective vendors to meet the needs of the project as set forth in the Statement of Work. Prospective vendors must submit information sufficient to allow NLM to evaluate based on the stated criteria.</p>
<p>Technical factors are of paramount consideration; however, cost is also important to the overall award decision. All evaluation factors other than cost, when combined, are significantly more important than cost. The Government can make tradeoffs among cost and technical factors in determining which Offeror(s) provide the best value by awarding to other than the lowest cost Offeror(s) or other than the highest technically rated Offeror(s). Offeror(s) are advised that award will be made to that Offeror(s) whose quote provides the best overall value to the Government.</p>
<p>Offerors are advised that each quotation may be subjected to a price analysis, as determined to be appropriate by the Government. In determining which quote represents the best value and results in the lowest overall cost alternative (considering price, special features, administrative costs, etc.) to meet the Government's needs, the Government shall evaluate quotes using the following technical evaluation criteria, which are listed in the order of relative importance with weights assigned for evaluation purposes:</p>
<p>Proposals submitted in response to this RFQ will be evaluated in accordance with the factors listed below:</p>
<p>Criterion A: Personnel (40 Points)<br />Proposal demonstrates that staff is competent and experienced in the skills required in the Statement of Work. Resumes of staff/consultants reflect not only academic qualifications, but also length and variety of experience in similar tasks and clearly demonstrate relevant training and experience. The percentage of time each staff member will contribute to the project is adequately identified. Proposal identifies a clear line of responsibility for the project. The proposal clearly documents the proposed staff's relevant expertise, education, availability and experience.</p>
<p>Criterion B: Past Performance (30 Points)<br />Offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction and timely delivery of high quality products and services. Past experience will be based upon the offeror's prior experience with similar activities.<br /><br />Criterion C: Understanding the Requirements and Technical Approach (30 points)<br />Proposal demonstrates an understanding of the requirements and indicates a clear awareness of the contract purpose and objectives. The proposal demonstrates in a detailed manner the approach and ability to perform all tasks and deliverables in the statement of work.

<DESC>Site Visit & Post Site Visit Questions (Q) and Answers (A):
1. How many employees are currently working on the contract, and how many hours are worked per employee per week? 	A: Currently, three employees are working for approximately 20 hours per week
2.  How much is used in the way of consumables? A: We dont know.  Historically, the Contractor has provided consumables, and they have not provided insight into how much is used on a monthly/yearly basis.
3.  How many square feet will be cleaned? 	A: We are unable to quantify how many square feet will be cleaned under this contract.
4.  Are you satisfied with your current vendor? 	A: We are not dissatisfied with our current Contractor.
5.  Clarify bridge A: We had a previous contract with a local vendor that did not work out.  While attempting to establish a base contract with option years, we required a six-month bridge to close the gap in services.
6.  I realize that you sent the dollar amount that covered the 6 month bridge, but would you send me the dollar amount for the last full option year of the current contract?  	A: There are no options to the current contract. See Question 5 above.
7.  Just a point of clarification on the windows. Is the USGS only looking for interior window cleaning except for the lower lobby windows and the interior windows in the hallway along building C?  	A: There are no exceptions to the windows that are cleaned.
8.  Would the USGS provide us with a flooring schematic/diagram. It need not have names/offices/functions. Simply floor/room dimensions. 	A. For security purposes, no floor schematics will be provided.

<DESC>Notice of Contract Action: Intent to Limit Competition (Reference FAR Part 5.201) <br /><br />The Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Theatre Battle Control Division intends to issue a solicitation for contract award on a limited competition basis for the Engineering &amp; Manufacturing Development (EMD), Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Initial Contractor Support (ICS) of the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long Range Radar (3DELRR) system. The 3DELRR Program will produce and field the radar system for the United States Air Force (USAF) that meets the Service's theater battle space awareness needs in the current and forecasted threat environment. 3DELRR will be the principal USAF long-range, ground-based sensor for detecting, identifying, tracking, and reporting aerial targets for the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) through the Theater Air Control System (TACS). It will replace the legacy USAF AN/TPS-75 radar system that is becoming unsupportable. The Government anticipates release of the Request for Proposal by late July 2013 and contract award in March 2014.<br /><br />The Government intends to award a contract following a competitive best value source selection based on written proposals and oral presentations limited to the incumbent prime contractors for the Pre-EMD period of the 3DELRR Technology Development Phase: Lockheed Martin Corporation; Northrop Grumman Systems Corporation; and Raytheon Company. The Government has determined to limit competition in accordance with 10 USC 2304(c) as implemented by FAR 6.302 (FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)); Only a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Pre-EMD contractors have developed full-scale prototype 3DELRR systems through Preliminary Design Review. Other contractors would require additional development costs which could not be recouped by the Government through full and open competition. A Justification and Approval for Other Than Full and Open Competition for this action will be posted to FedBizOpps within 15 calendar days of contract award. Other entities believing that they have the capability to fulfill the requirements of this acquisition must contact the Procurement Contracting Officer via email at elizabeth.damato@hanscom.af.mil no later than 15 calendar days after the date of this synopsis (03 May 2013).<br /><br />A Presolicitation Synopsis will be transmitted to FBO at least 15 calendar days prior to the Government's intent to release the final Request for Proposal for the 3DELRR EMD, LRIP and ICS solicitation.<br /><br />This NOCA is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a Request for Proposal.<br />

Services must be commercially available, meet industry standards for performance and transmission, be capable of interfacing with GSA's existing and future long distance services, and have capabilities and capacities to meet current and potential Government needs.</p>
<p>PROJECT DURATION: The Government anticipates an eight (8) year contract performance period, inclusive of both base period and option periods. <br /><br />COMPETITION: Unrestricted. This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform the resultant contract, will be required to submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, and woman-owned small businesses to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p>PROCUREMENT STRATGY: The successful offeror will be selected using the Best Value Source Selection process pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3. One or more firm fixed price (FFP) indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contracts are anticipated to be awarded. The successful offeror awarded the resultant contract shall be authorized to provide telecommunication services in the State of Alaska (and any subset thereof, i.e. borough, as applicable). Proof of this certification from the applicable authorities (i.e. State Public Utility Commissions, municipalities, etc.) shall be provided with submission of proposals.</p>

NOTE: At time of this Synopsis posting, it is the Government's intent to identify geographic areas within the State of Alaska which will each be awarded one FFP IDIQ contract, thus permitting a multiple single-award IDIQ strategy wherein one offeror may be awarded more than one geographic area, but no one geographic area shall have more than one IDIQ awarded as a result of this Solicitation. Final determination and further information related to this concept shall be provided in the RFP once issued, if applicable.</p>

Spaces which are located in areas with easy access to large thoroughfares are preferred.<br /><br />Fully serviced leases are sought.
