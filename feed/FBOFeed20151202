Authority:  10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1).   Supplies or services required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible source(s) and no other type of supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Therefore, the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302.   Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.
In accordance with FAR 52.225-3, Buy American Act - Free Trade Agreements, one or more of these items under this acquisition is subject to the Free Trade Agreement. 	 Based upon market research the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items in its solicitation for the described supplies or services.  However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Governments requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made.  No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the Contracting Officer for this contract and until the Contractor receives notice of such availability to be confirmed in writing by the Contracting Officer.
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation.  Hard copies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office.  The solicitation will be available for download only at www.fbo.gov.  
It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement  make contact with the firm(s) listed.
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application.  The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined.  Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g., if this is a small business set-aside).  Foreign sources may not participate as potential prime contractors but could if otherwise eligible participate as subcontractor(s).
Due to the complexity and criticality of this part, only actual manufactures that have successfully completed all testing required by the original company responsible for the design, or manufacturers that have successfully completed all testing on items determined by the government to be similar in complexity and criticality and can be considered approved sources for this item.
An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from Offerors or potential Offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the Ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the Ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to source of the concern. The Ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the Ombudsman at (405) 734-8241.  DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
22.	UID:  If unit price exceeds $5,000.00 then UID requirements will apply.

<DESC>RECOVERY: THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. This notice represents the intent to modify services provided by Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC under contract number HHSM-500-2012-M0012Z authorized under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. THIS IS NOT A<br />SOLICITATION FOR OFFERS.
<p>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, or Recovery Act) (Pub. L. 111-5) was signed into<br />law on February 17, 2009. The law includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health<br />Act (HITECH Act), which established programs to provide incentive payments for the "meaningful use" of certified <br />electronic health record (EHR) technology. Included in these incentive payments (also known as HITECH<br />payments) are payments to Medicare hospitals.</p>
<p>The purpose of this modification is to fund the contractor to collect and subsequently enter necessary data into HITECH FISS screens for all Subsection (d) Hospitals by March 31, 2011.</p>
<p>This contract action was not awarded as a fixed price type because uncertainties involved in contract performance did not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract. As such, a cost-reimbursement type action was awarded (FAR 16.301-2).</p>

<SUBJECT>A--Common Viewer System with Independent Threat Recognition Module(s)
<SOLNBR>D16PS00036
<CONTACT>Russell Choate
<DESC>Common Viewer System with Independent Threat Recognition Module(s)
An essential component of securing U.S. borders involves providing adequate infrastructure and technology at U.S. ports of entry (POEs) for expeditiously scanning and examining cargo and conveyances for contraband, weapons, bulk currency, radioactive materials and other illicit goods. U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) currently uses a variety of large and small scale Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) systems.   Each of these systems is operated independently and each has its own graphical user interface (GUI).  This results in training and operational inefficiencies.  This project will investigate the potential operational and manning efficiencies to be gained through the development and demonstration of a common viewer that supports the operation of different vendors systems, from both local and remote locations. 
The primary goal of this effort will be to evaluate the technical feasibility of integrating the output of multiple vendors NII technology into a service oriented architecture with a common viewer and network those workstations inside and out of the POE(s) and at other  locations in the command structure.  In addition, this System will be designed to accept independent third-party developed contraband threat recognition modules conforming to a common applications programming interface (API) to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of CBP officers to detect different types of contraband.  
The scope of the Common Viewer System with Independent Threat Recognition Module(s) is to develop, configure and demonstrate the System capabilities at a primary sea Port of Entry (POE) and then at secondary sea POEs (one or more additional).  
The long term goal is to enhance and optimize the efforts of CBP officers to resolve cargo security issues by creating a networked capability of detection technologies and other security related information, from multiple data sources and locations, on a common display.  This goal includes the interconnectivity of multiple locations on a local,  regional, and national basis; an effective, accessible, and searchable data repository; the implementation of a standards based integration of new technologies developed; the ability to overlay multiple NII technologies; the streamlining and simplification of officer training; and the ability to integrate multiple NII systems and other detection and information sources (e.g. 10+2, other law enforcement data, etc.) into a complete and accurate security profile.  These goals also include the incremental integration of contraband detection tools which will increase the effectiveness of CBP officers to detect a broad range contraband classes and to fully integrate this capability within the CBP network.
It will be the contractors responsibility to: (a) design a solution that will integrate multiple vendors NII technology into a common viewer (b) demonstrate that the technical approach will work in a laboratory environment/proof of concept; (c) develop a Full Scale Prototype System; and (d) demonstrate the networked System in live POE operations.  The Statement of Work (SOW) defines the tasks necessary to develop the Common Viewer System including: program management, concept definition/validation, prototype development/testing, field evaluations, and options for acquiring additional Systems and capabilities. This demonstration includes both local and remote connectivity capability for field officers at the POEs.   
The Request for Proposal (RFP) will contain a baseline system demonstration which will be divided into four (4) phases.  This baseline demonstration will end with a full demonstration of the system capability at two or more POEs.  The notional period of performance for the baseline demonstration is 13  22 months. In addition, there will several options which will allow the Government to expand the system capability which could include additional training; integration of threat recognition modules; integration of additional detection systems and information; deployment of additional systems; and system support.  
This project is under the technical direction of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science & Technology (S&T), Border and Maritime Security Division (BMSD) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Office of Information and Technology (OIT), Laboratories and Scientific Services Division (LSS), and the Interdiction Technology Branch (ITB).

<DESC>The NASA Shared Services Center plans to issue a solicitation for the re-competition of its current Enterprise Applications Services Technologies (EAST) contract. This procurement, EAST 2, will be conducted on an unrestricted basis (full and open competition) utilizing FAR Part 15 source selection procedures. EAST 2 will support the NASA Enterprise Applications Competency Center (NEACC), located at the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, AL. <p> The anticipated release date of the draft Request for Proposal (RFP) is on or about December 12, 2014.  NASA intends to hold an Industry Day on January 8, 2015, at MSFC. Comments and questions concerning the draft RFP will be accepted through January 20, 2015. The anticipated release date of the final RFP is on or about March 4, 2015, with offers due approximately 60 days later. <p> The NSSC intends to award a single Cost-Plus-Performance-Fee contract with an Indefinite-Delivery-Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) component. Performance fee will be tied to minimum Service Level Standards.  The work consists of maintenance, operation, new development and management of NASA Enterprise Applications to ensure that information technology investments continue to enable the Agencys mission. MSFC-specific applications will also be included in the core work of EAST 2. The IDIQ portion will enable the migration of Center-specific applications at other NASA Centers into the EAST 2 contract. <p> The majority of services under this contract will be performed at MSFC, Huntsville, Alabama.  In the event other NASA Center-specific applications are transitioned into the EAST 2 contract via the IDIQ feature and as support from other locations may be required to meet contractual requirements, other locations as appropriate may be approved in writing by the Contracting Officer. <p> This contract is anticipated to have a period of performance of five years, consisting of a base period of two years, one two-year option period, and one one-year option period. To incentivize sustained, superior contract performance, the contract will also contain an award term option provision that will provide the contractor with the opportunity to earn up to three additional option years (contract years six, seven, and eight). The total potential period of performance, including all options and award term options, is eight years. <p> Significant small business subcontracting goals for small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business concerns will be included in the contract. <p> The NAICS Code and Size Standard are 541512 and annual receipts less than $27.5 Million, respectively. <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable. The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>   . <p> The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available via the NASA Business Opportunities home page <A HREF="http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=">http://procurement.na sa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin= </A>   and on fedbizopps.gov. <p> It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps.gov web page for information on the draft and final RFP releases and amendments to this solicitation.

If any of the key personnel or supporting disciplines being provided by subconsultant firms, identify the link between the prime and subconsultant personnel, designating the team member, firm, and capability each will provide for this contract.
 The chart shall be submitted on a single 11 x 17 sized sheet and use a font size of 10 points or larger.  Resumes of personnel providing supporting services (items a through s above) are not required and will not be evaluated.
3.   Past Performance.  A-E firms will be evaluated based on past performance on projects relevant to selection criterion (1) above with Government agencies and private industry in terms of cost control, quality of work, and compliance with performance schedules.  Past performance information not related to the projects related selection criterion (1) will not be considered.  The A-E shall provide ACASS performance documentation or similar for each project.  If an ACASS performance documentation or similar for each project is not available, provide a Performance Survey (download from the NECO website) and submit the Survey with the SF330).
  The Performance Survey shall be from the contracting agent and/or their representative responsible for the contract administration, or from the facility owner/user.  It shall not be from the prime contractor on a project nor shall it be from a prime contractor to a subcontractor.  If the A-E received any less than satisfactory past performance evaluations from customers/owners, it is incumbent upon the A-E to provide an explanation of the rating and what the A-E has done or will do to preclude less than satisfactory ratings on future contracts.  In evaluating past performance, the Government may consider information in the A-Es SF330 and information gathered from other sources including former customers, Government agencies, federal databases and other references.
  The info provided by the A-E may provide the major portion of the information used in the Governments evaluation for past performance.  The Government, however, is not restricted to the information provided by the Offeror and may use other sources to assess  past performance info such as the Past Performance Info Retrieval System (PPIRS), A-E Contract Administration Support System (ACASS), and inquiries with previous customers/owners. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT: (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  If an A-E is utilizing past performance information of affiliates/subsidiaries/parent /LLC/LTD member companies, the proposal shall clearly demonstrate that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies will have meaningful involvement in the performance of the contract in order for the past performance info of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies to be considered.
  

The information submitted shall state specific commitments of technical resources (e.g. personnel, equipment) that the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies will commit to the performance of this contract.  In particular, the submitted information will clearly state the specific commitments of resources of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member that will perform the contract requirements.  The SF330 shall also describe specific roles of the affiliate/subsidiary/parent/LLC/LTD member companies in terms of the work it will either self-perform or manage on behalf of the A-E for future task orders in performance of the contract.  A subcontractors or subconsultants past performance will not be given the same level of consideration as either the prime contractor or the joint venture partner because there is no direct legal relationship between the Government and the subcontractor/subconsultant.

The Government will consider the past performance and experience of a subcontractor/subconsultant where the prime contractor provides, in its SF330, evidence of a binding teaming agreement or other contractual agreement which creates legal responsibility on the part of the prime contractor and the subcontractor/subconsultant to enter into a subcontract.
 However, the level of consideration will depend on the extent to which the A-E demonstrates the prime contractors commitment to award a subcontract to the subcontractor/subconsultant and subcontractors/subconsultants commitment to enter into a subcontract with the prime contractor, including legal accountability for both parties.  Prime contractor-subcontractor/subconsultant teams/Joint Ventures/LLCs/LTDs with a demonstrated history of working successfully together on prior projects may be considered more favorably than those without such history.

4.	Capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Describe the proposed teams ability to complete several large and small task orders concurrently requiring quick turnaround.
  Describe the firms ability to perform and manage multiple complex projects in different locations and the ability to surge to meet unexpected demands.
Describe the firms ability to provide qualified backup staffing for key personnel to ensure continuity of service with minimal disruption to projects initiated under other NAVFAC PAC contracts/task orders. Indicate the firms current workload and the availability of the prime and subconsultants for the specified performance period.

5.	Quality Control Program. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Briefly describe how the prime ensures quality consistently across the entire team and how quality of subcontractors work is assured.
  Briefly describe internal quality assurance procedures and indicate effectiveness. Address the teams QC processes for checking documents for errors, omissions and quality and incorporating and tracking review comments.

6.	A-E Firms Location: A-E firms will be evaluated on the locations of the office or offices from which the A-E firm will perform the work under this contract.  Locations within the general geographical area of the work and knowledge of the locality of the work (e.g., Hawaii, Guam, and other areas within the NAVFAC Pacific AOR) will be evaluated. 

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT:  (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Indicate the location of the office that will be performing the work including sub-consultants offices.
  Describe and illustrate the teams knowledge of the geographical area (e.g., Hawaii, Guam, and other areas within the NAVFAC Pacific AOR).  Address ability of the firm to ensure timely response to requests for on site support.   

7.	Volume of Work: A-E firms will be evaluated in terms of work previously awarded to the A-E firm by Department of Defense (DoD) within the past 12 months, with the objective of effecting an equitable distribution of Department of Defense A-E contracts among qualified A-E firms and firms that have not had Department of Defense contracts.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENT: (SF330, Part 1, Section H).  Provide a list of DoD contracts or task orders awarded in the past 12 months.
  Include dollar amount for each contract/task order awarded.  If the firm performed work as a subcontractor, indicate the contract and/or task order of the prime contractor and the estimated amount completed as the subcontractor.  A-E firms with multiple offices shall indicate which branch office completed each project.

<p>To meet the Congressional mandates of Plan Merida, INL programs in the region include the following objectives:</p>
<p>&bull;	Continue to support Mexican state and federal entities with efforts to institutionalize the rule of law among law enforcement and judicial sector operators, including through police professionalization, justice sector reform, anti-corruption, and border security initiatives.  <br />&bull;	Help Mexico achieve its transition to the new criminal justice system.<br />&bull;	Create a 21st century border structure, by further developing Mexico's capacity to detect and prevent smuggling of illicit goods and trafficking in persons.  Support networked technology systems and professionalization to strengthen Mexico's control of its northern and southern borders and ports of entry.<br />&bull;	Bolster Mexico's efforts to prevent crime and violence by supporting the establishment of resilient communities better able to withstand the pressures of organized crime through drug demand reduction, citizen oversight of security forces, and culture of lawfulness programs. <br />&bull;	Continue to build Mexico's capacity to disrupt and dismantle organized criminal networks, including capacity building to counter illicit finance and combat the production of, and trafficking in, illegal narcotics. <br />&bull;	Support the U.S. Embassy's second overall goal from its FY14-16 Integrated Country Strategy (ICS): to support Mexican state and society efforts to establish highly efficient, transparent, and accountable prosecutorial, correctional, and alternative justice institutions that respect human rights; to assist Mexico in improving federal, state, and local governments' operational ability to prevent and mitigate crime and terrorism, impact transnational criminal organization (TCO) cash flow, contribute to criminal cases against TCO leaders and members, disrupt TCO trust and corruptive relationship, and safely apprehend TCO and other high target offenders; and to improve border security, including building support to the Mexican government's efforts to secure their southern border.</p>

<DESC>Synopsis: This Request for Information (RFI) Sources Sought (SS) is to identify any interested sources before soliciting a non-competitive acquisition per FAR 6.302-1 "Only One Responsible Source" for a modification to the Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) Tactical Mast Terminal (TMT) Trailer System. This is not a solicitation for proposals and no contract shall be awarded from this announcement. This is not a request for proposal.
<p>The requirements of this acquisition are to deliver a Tactical Mast Terminal (TMT) Trailer System's Version 2 (V2) Technical Data Package (TDP); manufacture and deliver TMT end items for use for the IAMD Battle Command System (IBCS) Program in support of long lead and Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) activities; provide engineering and logistical efforts as required to develop and incorporate TMT problem fixes and obsolescent part replacements; provide repair and replace support for the system; and provide spares.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional acquisition programs that focus primarily on the development of a single system or platform, the Army IAMD (AIAMD) Program is uniquely structured to enable the development of an overarching System of Systems (SoS) capability with all participating Army Air Defense components functioning interdependently to provide total-operational capabilities not achievable by the individual element systems. The AIAMD program achieves this objective by establishing the AIAMD architecture and developing the IBCS that provides Engagement Operations Centers (EOCs) implementing common Mission Command (MC) capability, an Integrated Fire Control Network (IFCN) capability for fire-control connectivity enabling distributed operations, and the common Plug and Fight (P&amp;F) B-Kits located on the EOCs and the IFCN Relays that network enable existing sensor components and weapon components with the IBCS. P&amp;F A-Kits are developed and integrated on the various Component Acquisition Program (CAP) weapon and sensor Major End Items (MEI) and are interfaced to IBCS, which implements the overarching IAMD SoS networking capability.</p>
<p>The TMT Trailer System is based on the Warfighter Information Network - Tactical (WIN-T) Increment 2 Tactical Relay-Tower (TR-T) V1 tactical major end item that is reconfigured into the TMT Trailer System to satisfy specific IAMD System requirements while maximizing commonality with Army standard items. The IFCN Relay developed on the IBCS contract uses the TMT Trailer, provided as GFE, as the platform that additional IBCS developed mission equipment is integrated. The IBCS IFCN Relay, along with other IBCS EOCs, are currently entering into IAMD Limited User Testing and scheduled for IAMD developmental/operational testing in 2016.</p>

<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Office of Acquisitions and Grants Services (OAGS) has issued this sources sought announcement on behalf of the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) in order to determine if there are existing sources capable of providing services to:<br /><br />&bull; Establish a mechanism for CTP to elicit assessments and evaluations of tobacco-related public education activities<br />&bull; Qualitatively and quantitatively measure and report to the FDA the degree to which these activities lead to successful outcomes<br />&bull; Identify the need for effectiveness-improving adjustments<br />&bull; Assess and report to the FDA the long-term public health impact of these activities<br /><br />If your firm is considered a source under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code 923120, Administration of Public Health Programs, and you believe that your firm would be able to provide the FDA with the services described below, please submit an email to Aimee.Swann@fda.hhs.gov.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background</span><br />The Center for Tobacco Products is tasked with developing and implementing effective regulatory strategies for reducing the public health burden of tobacco products. With emphasis upon preventing and reducing tobacco use among young people in the United States, CTP is executing a campaign of public education activities to inform a variety of audiences about tobacco products and their regulation designed to discourage tobacco use. <br /><br />CTP seeks to conduct evaluations of its campaigns to measure the impact and effectiveness of its public education activities on reducing tobacco-related death and disease. This will include process evaluations to assess whether activities were conducted as planned, outcome evaluations to assess how well program activities achieved the intended goals and objectives, and pre-testing of evaluation methodologies to assess effectiveness of new evaluation approaches. Campaign-related outcome evaluation measures will include gauging target audience exposure to, awareness of, and receptivity to, messages in relation to resultant changes in tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. <br /><br />Evaluation of CTP's public education activities, particularly campaigns, is complicated by the multiple factors that influence tobacco initiation, use, and cessation behaviors. Further, measuring exposure to specific campaigns is increasingly complicated. CTP requires rigorous scientific evaluations of its national and local tobacco-related public education activities and programs that account for these complex factors.</p>

<DESC><strong>Contracting Office Address: </strong>Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Institutes on Drug Abuse, Station Support Simplified Acquisitions,
<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>This is a <strong>Small Business Sources Sought </strong>notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations.</p>
<p>The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.</p>
<p><strong>Product Description:<br /></strong>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Section on Neuroanatomy requires a regeneratively mode-locked, 70fs tunable light source with automated dispersion compensation. The contractor is responsible for providing the following:</p>
<p>1.   Regenerative mode-locking, not passive or Kerr Lens only mode-locking.</p>
<p>2.  Pulse width of 70 fs.</p>
<p>3.  Automated dispersion compensation module, capable of being used with similar Mai Tai lasers.</p>
<p>4.   The higher the level of on-site service and repair that can be provided, will enhance group productivity</p>
<p>5.  Tuning range of 690-1040 nm.</p>
<p>6.  Repetition rate 80 MHz nominal.</p>
<p>7.  The laboratory has developed custom software for a microscope to control the Mai Tai laser and Deep See.  This software would take several man-months to replicate with a different laser.</p>
<p>8.   Deep See automatically compensates for the pulse broadening encountered in the optical train of a microscope, lenses, modulators, and filters.  The pulse broadening is not the same value for all wavelengths.  It is nearly twice as great at the shorter end of the tuning curve as it is at the longer [redder] wavelengths.  The Deep See will set the desired value of pre-compensation automatically as the Mai Tai is tuned in wavelength.</p>
<p>9.  The Deep See module can be used on virtually any Mai Tai laser providing flexibility for the laboratory.  Other designs are part of the laser and cannot have this capability.</p>
<p>10. Generate and store multiple dispersion compensation curves.</p>
<p>11. One (1) Year warranty to include on-site maintenance service.</p>
<p><strong>Anticipated Delivery: </strong>Delivery shall occur within 30 days after receipt of order.</p>

<DESC>This is a Small Business Sources Sought Notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service- disabled , veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a set-aside is possible. An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice.
<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine (NLM) is conducting a market survey to help determine the availability and technical capability of qualified small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses and/or HUBZone small businesses capable of serving the needs identified below.<br />This Sources Sought Notice is for informational and planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a solicitation or as an obligation or commitment by the Government. This notice is intended strictly for market research.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND<br /></strong>The ChemIDplus database is a public web-based search system that provides access to structure and nomenclature to identify chemicals cited in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) databases and in other major government databases. The database contains over 400,000 chemical records of which over 320,000 include chemical structures. The software used by ChemIDplus includes AccelrysHost, AccelrysDirect, Tomcat Server, Apache Server and Oracle. The software setup between these four systems is complex, and needs to be monitored and upgraded with increased usage. The ChemIDplus system also provides the backend for the NLM Drug Information Portal and the Food and Drug Administration Substance Registry System (FDASRS). The Drug Information Portal provides users with links and selected drug information from NLM and other key U.S. government agencies. The FDASRS which provides unique identifiers for substances in drugs, biologics, and more also provides links to additional resources. The data these systems generate and support must be updated, maintained and mined in order to provide optimal access and usability to the public.</p>
<p><br /><strong>OBJECTIVE<br /></strong>The NLM Division of Specialized Information Services (SIS) requires professional services to provide support and maintenance of ChemIDplus and related databases and applications.</p>
<p><br /><strong>PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:<br /></strong>Tasks may include but are not limited to the following:</p>
<p>1. Update ChemIDplus Data Elements - The contractor will update data elements within ChemIDplus such as the locators within the records. Locator examples include, but are not limited to: MeSH, Clinical Trials, and DailyMed.</p>
<p>2. Acquire Chemical Data and Draw Chemical Structures - The contractor will provide NLM with structural diagrams in Accelrys format for chemicals in ChemIDplus that do not have structural data and/or for chemicals added to the database. NLM will prioritize this list according to need. Structures will either be drawn using programs such as AccelrysDraw, or converted using appropriate software from nomenclature in ChemIDplus.</p>
<p>3. Perform Quality Control on the ChemIDplus database - The contractor will systematically check all structure, name and molecular formula data for consistency and accuracy.</p>
<p>4. Acquire Drug Information - The contractor will monitor the monthly USAN list, and by formatting data received under license from USP for addition to ChemIDplus. Also, update Locators such as TSCAINV when new data is available.</p>
<p>5. Additional Data Support - The contractor will provide additional data support for related database activities for interagency agreements or special enhancement activities related to ChemIDplus and related databases. Additional support activities are similar in nature to tasks 1-4.<br /><br /><strong>ANTICIPATED PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br /></strong>The NLM anticipates a period of performance of 12-month period from the date of award, with two (2) 12-month option periods, if exercised. The anticipated award date is expected to be on or around January 1, 2016.</p>
<p><strong>OTHER IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS</strong><br />The NLM anticipates the proposed acquisition will be procured as an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) type contract to be issued in accordance with the policies and procedures under FAR Part 15 - Simplified Procedures for Certain Commercial Items and FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items-General.

<p>Data Services Modernization and Feature Requirements<br />ETA's Information Management Reference Architecture including Data Management Layers and the progression of data from the Raw Data Reservoir to Foundation and then onto Access for increased data quality and enrichment, increased formalization of definition, increased "ease of use", simplified data model and reduced cost of query concurrency.<br />ETA's Data Ingestion, responsible for moving, cleaning and transforming data, as near real-time streaming, Extract Transform and Load (ETL) and Extract Load and Transform (ELT). <br />The Information Interpretation component to present information to ETA's external systems and services. It may interface with any of the data management layers. The Information Interpretation component will be implemented using a variety of Analytical, Data Science and BI tools. <br />High-Level Enterprise Data Services Technical Requirements using the components in the Information Management Reference Architecture as a foundation, including a scalable and balanced hardware platform. An ETA-wide capability to store and manage large volumes of data cost effectively, while meeting reliability, availability and performance service levels. <br />Functional capabilities for an efficient data load and transformation, in batch and real time scenarios as well as application-transparent optimizations for physical data models that will enable ETA systems to support high levels of concurrency and low query response times, even in ad-hoc query environments. <br />Tools to monitor, manage and optimize the environment as a whole and integrated analytics and feature-rich reporting capability for high performance Information Interpretation. <br />Data Modeling including Conceptual, Logical, Physical and Derived Model to answer the business questions and the logical relationships between different parts of the information and DOL's Governance and data integrity requirements may demand the use of certain constraints, primary keys and foreign keys and comparing the logical design with various physical attributes of enterprise database.<br />Hardware Architecture considerations require building a balanced infrastructure that is both reliable and easy to scale out quickly requires considerable expertise and not only delivers a reliable, high performance platform, but scalability is also fundamental to its design. It should also provide high-end design for extreme IO performance; the ability to read and write data at very high rates. <br />Absolute application transparency with enhanced scalability and performance is fundamental to the modern ETA Data Services design. Servers enabled scans and other resource-consuming features to be off-loaded away from the database servers and multiple nodes can be connected together using a unified InfiniBand fabric. <br />New Data as a service solution requires high performance interconnects between database servers and the storage infrastructure because queries and transformations are likely to read and write large volumes of data and a high performance data channel or interconnect is required between database servers to enable parallel processing to scale across a cluster of machines. <br />Industry level enterprise storage architecture that can distributes database IO across all available storage devices, and scale up (or down) capabilities in a seamless manner without outage. Assurance of efficiency and high performance for large table scans and other IO-intensive operations. All components in the storage infrastructure must be optimized to sustain high levels of IO throughput. <br />ETA-wide managing high data volumes ad larger tables must be partitioned for optimal and scalable data management. Similarly subdividing partitions into smaller sub-partitions that can be used to for improving query join and scan performance. <br />In addition data compression functionality to reduce the amount of storage space required for ETA's enterprise consolidated and relational environment. The advanced compression in different partitions can be subject to different compression choices including basic compression, OLTP compression (a component of the Advanced Compression option), and Hybrid Columnar Compression techniques. <br />Similarly the Data Services modernization may require the implementation of Raw Data Reservoirs to ingest data from applications and deliver data from a staging area for high performance systems. It should be designed and tested carefully to ensure that they will be capable of delivering data at the required rate. Network storage devices are likely to require multiple network paths to the database servers. The design can be leveraged with Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) for storing and processing very large volumes of data. <br />Moreover the new data services design should be capable enough to use external tables and provides a consistent, optimized and flexible approach to batch and micro-batch loading from raw data reservoirs implemented using "conventional" file systems. External tables created can be queried in the normal manner using standard SELECT statements. Master Data Management (MDM) based Data Services design should have the Batch Loading services capability for high-performance data loads. Direct path loading can be commonly used in combination with external tables. <br />Functionality for data replication and streaming to capture Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL) changes made to database objects and replicate those changes to one or more other databases. ETA data streaming capability will require capture processes or synchronous capture captures changes made to source database objects and formats them into LCRs, which can be propagated to destination databases and then applied by data streams apply processes.<br />Handling ETA data coming from multiple programs and concurrent quarterly loads parallelism for query performance and parallel execution is a key requirement to utilize all available hardware resources effectively: multiple CPUs, multiple IO channels, multiple storage arrays and disk drives, and large volumes of memory. Auto degree of Parallelism should be used to invoke parallelism when it is appropriate meeting the SLAs in Cloud set-up.<br />Materialized views and data reusability approach for expensive repetitive queries to optimize runtime and OIST resource consumption. Queries will usually analyze a subset or aggregation of the detailed data, so a mechanism to pre-summarize and pre-aggregate data for direct use by queries offers the potential to improve query performance significantly for BI canned and ETA-wide ad-hoc reporting.<br />The next generation System Management capabilities should include data workload management including important components like Real Application Clusters (RAC), Database Resource Manager, IO Resource Manager and Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (EMCC), including enterprise data monitoring and optimizer Statistics management. <br />CURRENT ENVIRONMENT: <br />The Data Services solution must be capable of interfacing with the existing environment in order to eventually displace this functionality. The current Data Warehouse development, test, and production environments are built upon the following set of tools:<br />Environment #1<br />Data Tier: Oracle 10g/Oracle 11g<br />OS: Oracle Solaris<br />Space: 7TB<br />Growth is approximately 5 GB per month.</p>
<p>Environment #2<br />Data Tier: Sybase IQ/ MySQL<br />OS: MS Windows<br />Space: 2.4TB<br />Growth is approximately 5 GB per month.</p>
<p><br />CONSTRAINTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS:<br />All responses should be sure to include recommendations for optimal bandwidth, data storage, architectural components and any additional requirements to ensure optimum SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS capabilities are maximized.</p>
<p>ETA also desires to understand the best practices in managing onboarding of multiple data sources along with recommendations about how to manage loading of data into the warehouse including but not limited to architectural designs that provide maximum flexibility to consume large volumes of data while not limiting the access to the data from the users of the reporting tools (i.e. proposed methodologies, schedules, batch windows, etc).</p>

<CONTACT>Sherrie Plonski, Deputy for Small Business, Phone 412-395-7127, Email sherrie.plonski@usace.army.mil
<DESC>This is a Sources Sought announcement only. This is not a Request for Proposal. This request does not obligate the Government in any contract award. The Government will not pay for the provision of any information, nor will it compensate any respondents for the development of such information. Response to this notice is strictly voluntary and will not affect any vendor's ability to submit a proposal if and when a solicitation is issued. The purpose of this synopsis is to survey the market and gain knowledge of potential interested contractors for completing the work effort relative to NAICS 237310-HIGHWAY, STREET AND BRIDGE CONSTRUCTION.
<p>Estimated magnitude of construction: $250K - $500K</p>
<p>The Whiteday Creek Public Access Bridge is located at the entrance to Opekiska Lock and Dam near Everettville, WV, 7 miles southwest of Morgantown, WV. The bridge carries Opekiska Road (Route 36) across the mouth of Whiteday Creek where it empties into the Monongahela River to provide the only public land access to the locks.</p>
<p>The bridge consists of three simple spans and measures 200'-0" in length overall between the abutment bearings. The two end spans each span 50'-0" between the abutment bearing and pier centerlines, while the middle span spans 100'-0" between the pier centerlines. Transversely, the deck measures 25'-0" out-to-out and 21'-0" from curb-to-curb. Guardrails are installed above both curbs. The main load-carrying members are eight adjacent precast pre-stressed concrete box beams. At the Main Span, each single-cell beam measures 4'-0" in height at the ends over the piers and 3'-9" in height at mid-span. The Main Span box beams are post-tensioned with two 1&frac14;" tie rods through solid concrete diaphragms at three separate and equally spaced locations along the span. Grouted shear keys are located longitudinally between the beams near the top. An asphalt wearing surface overlays the tops of the box beams. At the Main Span, the overlay thickness measures 3&frac12;" at the roadway centerline and is gradually sloped to both curbs for drainage. The substructure includes two single-shaft reinforced concrete piers situated on sound rock. Additionally, the reinforced concrete abutments are founded on steel piles driven to sound rock.</p>
<p>There is evidence that water is penetrating the box beams and that the shear keys between adjacent beams are deteriorated. The exposed pre-stressing strands are cause for concern as the pretension force in the strands and structural capacity of the affected box beams are assumed to be compromised. The bridge currently has a 5 ton weight limit to reduce the impact on the bridge.</p>
<p>The Contractor will install carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips to the underside of the Main Span box beams to strengthen the beams. The CFRP strips will be installed after making concrete repairs to spalled areas with exposed pre-stressing strands. Approximately 90 linear feet of 4-foot wide beam flange will need to be repaired and reinforced with CFRP strips. Repairs will consist of removing unsound concrete, cleaning exposed reinforcing and pre-stressing strands, applying a corrosion inhibitor and bonding agent, and repairing the area with low-permeability concrete patch material. The bottom of the beams are approximately 4'-3" (at their lowest) to 5'-6" (at their highest) above normal pool elevation. Actual clear distance will vary based on releases from Opekiska Lock and Dam and the time of year.</p>
<p>The project completion date is set at 150 days following contract award. The Notice to Proceed (NTP) will be granted by the Contracting Officer following contract award after the Contractor provides Performance and Payment bonds.</p>
<p>Official Solicitation will likely be issued March of 2016. Results of this sources sought will be used, in part, to determine the feasibility of a small business or lower tier socio-economic set aside for this project and to determine if the Rule of 2 has been met for any particular category of small business. All qualified contractors are encouraged to respond; lack of responses may jeopardize the project being set aside for small business.</p>
<p>Offeror's response to synopsis shall be limited to 8 pages and shall include the following information:</p>
<p>-Offeror's name, address, point of contact, phone number, and e-mail address, and web site (if any);</p>
<p>-Offeror's business designation and socioeconomic sector (eg. Large, Small, 8(a), Woman-owned, Service-disabled Veteran Owned, HUBZone, Small Disadvantaged, etc.);</p>
<p>-Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code and DUNS Number; if a member of a joint-venture or mentor-prot&eacute;g&eacute; agreement with the SBA, please provide information on both members of the JV.</p>
<p>-Contractor's Bonding Capacity</p>
<p>-Offeror's interest in bidding on the solicitation once it is issued;</p>
<p>-Offeror's capability to meet the requirements including specific equipment and experience with the means and methods described in this sources sought announcement; if a member of a joint venture, the offeror should include relevant information from both members of the JV. Do not provide information on other repair methods as this project has already been developed and other methods have been considered and discarded as not feasible either in terms of cost or other factors.</p>
<p>-Offeror's ability to perform at least 15% of the effort with its own equipment;</p>
<p>-Offeror's capability to perform a contract of this complexity, comparable work performed within the past 5 years, including a brief description of the project, customer name, timelines of performance, customer satisfaction, and dollar value of project. If a member of a joint venture, the offeror should include relevant information from both members of the JV.</p>
<p>Interested Offerors shall respond to this Sources Sought Synopsis no later than 3:00PM (EST) on 16 December, 2015. E-mail is perferred method of replying to this synopsis. Please respond to the point of contact listed in this sources sought announcement.</p>

<DESC>This is a sources sought announcement only and is not a request for proposals or quotes. The Government does not intend to make an award on the basis of this Sources Sought Notice or otherwise pay for the information solicited herein.  This notice is for the purpose of identifying potential sources and does not commit the Government to make an award and /or issue a solicitation.
. 

The Department of Veterans Affairs, Central Alabama Veteran Healthcare System (CAVHCS) plans to engage in a contract with a community provider(s) (Contractor) who will provide, at their site, a Safe Haven housing program to Veterans along with services consistent with Health Care for Homeless Veterans (HCHV) program objectives and Safe Haven Model.  The goal of this contract is to remove homeless Veterans from the street or places unfit for human habitation and place them in community-based, residential environments. These residences must have sufficient services to meet the needs of the Veterans served.  The anticipated contract will be for the period of February 27, 2016 through February 26, 2017, with four (4), one (1) year option periods to be exercised at the Government's discretion.  

A Safe Haven Model is a 24-hour/7-days-a-week community-based early recovery model of supportive housing that serves hard-to-reach, hard-to-engage homeless individuals with severe mental illness and substance use disorders. The program places no treatment participation demands on residents but expects them to transition from unsafe and unstable street life to permanent housing and re-engage with treatment services. In July 2010, under the leadership and direction of the VA National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans, the National Homeless Program Office funded four Safe Haven model development projects to develop and implement a model that could be replicated throughout the VA, broadening the agency's homeless continuum of care.

A DRAFT Statement of Work is provided to assist the Department of Veterans Affairs in conducting market research of industry to identify potential contractors to provide the services identified.
The applicable NAICS code is 624229 - Other Community Housing Services, with a small business size standard of $15M.
Firms/Companies with interest and capability responding to these requirements should develop a short narrative including relevant documentation, specific evidence and any other information indicating the capability to successfully fulfill the aforementioned requirements. 
Interested parties should send their company's information via e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Valeria B. Murray, at Valeria.Murray@va.gov. Company information must include business type e.g. Service Disabled Veteran Owned Business, Woman Owned Small Business, etc. Information shall be provided no later than 5:00 PM EST, December 15, 2015.

<DESC>Request for Information - Mobile Hearing Aid Distance Fitting Application

Introduction: This is a request for information (RFI) only.  Do not submit a proposal or quote.  As a part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Technology Acquisition Center (TAC) market research process, this RFI will be used to assist VA in finalizing the Mobile Hearing Aid Distance Fitting Application (HADFA) Performance Work Statement (PWS) and formulating an acquisition strategy. Additionally, there is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this RFI.  Your response to this RFI will be treated only as information for the Government to consider.  You will not be entitled to payment for direct or indirect costs that you incur in responding to this RFI.  This request does not constitute a solicitation for proposals or the authority to enter into negotiations to award a contract.  No funds have been authorized, appropriate, or received for this effort.  Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary, restricted or competition sensitive information contained in their response.  The Government does not intend to pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.
Background:  The mission of VA Center for Innovation (CI) is to provide innovative solutions to complex VA problems.  VACI strives to elicit solutions that in turn provide high quality, effective, and efficient Information Technology (IT) services to those responsible for providing care to the Veterans at the point-of-care as well as throughout all the points of the Veterans' health care in an effective, timely and compassionate manner.
 VACI developed a mobile HADFA prototype, with Phonak, for use with Android smartphones. The main objective was to increase patient access to audio-logical services, reduce costs and inconveniences associated with medical travel, minimize stress on family caregivers (who often provide transportation to appointments), reduce the amount of absenteeism from work, increase the ability to rapidly respond to issues, and limit CO2 emissions associated with increased travel.  Additionally, the goal was to decrease the burden on busy providers and clinics and increase patient satisfaction by increasing timeliness and quality of care.
VACI and Phonak conducted an in depth evaluation of the HADFA system and confirmed the optimal configurations for the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center, September 26, 2013 -May 27, 2014.  The HAFDA prototype enabled audiologists to program subject's hearing aids while the subject was in the comfort of their own home. The audiologist was able to successfully connect to the hearing aids in 95% of the appointments. 

The prototype Android open source HAFDA code used in the evaluation above is available at the following link: https://github.com/VHAINNOVATIONS/Mobile-Distance-Hearing-Aid-Application.  
A general description of the prototype functionality is available in the Mobile DISHAF: Technical Operation and Maintenance Manual (See Attached).
High Level Technical Functional Requirements:  VACI is looking for HADFA solutions for use with a patient's Android and iOS smartphone for nation-wide use, which includes:
"	Data communication between the patient's hearing aid and audiologist software for remote hearing aid after care adjustments (e.g., compression, gain) via an iOS and Android smartphone application,
"	No prevention of standard voice communication from being used on the smartphone while the application is running,
"	Secure architecture that shall pose no risk to VA networks,
"	Wireless connection between smartphone, hearing aid, and (if necessary) fitting device(s),
"	Video conferencing over Wi-Fi from the users smartphone, 
"	An embedded user manual, within the mobile application,  
Questions and Considerations for interested Contractors:

Responses to this RFI by interested parties will be used as part of market research by VA representatives to finalize the PWS and develop the acquisition strategy.  In accordance with FAR 15.201(E), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Any contract that might be awarded based on information received or derived from this RFI will be the outcome of a competitive process.  This announcement is based upon the best information available, is subject to future modification, is not a request for proposal, and in no way commits the Government to award of a contract.  The VA will not be responsible for any costs incurred by responding to this RFI. 
This is an RFI only.  It is requested that all companies interested in participating in this effort please note their interest, and respond to the areas identified in the "Capabilities Statement" and "General Question" sections below.

Capabilities Statement:

The page limit for responses to this section is 3 pages.

The following vendor information must be provided with your submission:
Name of Company:
Address:
DUNS Number:
Point of Contact:
Phone Number:
Fax Number:
Email address:
Contract Number and Schedule/SIIN Number:
Company Business Size and Status under NAICS code: 541511
1.	Provide a brief summary of your technical approach to meet VA's high-level requirements detailed above. If a commercially available product is included in the technical approach, identify any expected modifications that would be required to support the high-level requirements detailed above.
2.	What data rights are applied to your solution?
3.	Provide a high-level estimate of the timelines needed to successfully implement the applications.
4.	Provide information if services and products are available under any Federal Contract Vehicle, e.g., GWACs, GSA Federal Supply Schedule, T4, etc.
5.	Provide a rough order of magnitude.
General Questions:  
The page limit for responses to this section is 5 pages. 
1.	Based on the information provided, can the Mobile HADFA applications be developed by a non-hearing aid company? Explain why or why not.
2.	Is it feasible to utilize the existing Android open source HAFDA code to complete the high-level requirements above? Explain why or why not.
3.	Explain how your approach would allow unique hearing aid manufacturers (e.g., from the VA National Hearing Aid Contract) to connect to the relay server (described in the Technical Manual). A relay enables a secure Internet connection between the audiologist computer and the patient smartphone, which might be located in local networks protected by a firewall, Network Address translation, or mobile network router, and thus not directly accessible. If a non-hearing aid vendor develops the application, how can you ensure it would connect to all models of VA hearing aids?
4.	There are currently three different wireless protocols: 2.4 GHz, 900 MHz, and NFM I (nearfield magnetic induction).  How many protocols would your technical approach work with?   (It must fit with one of these protocols.)
5.	How would the application connect to hearing aids, (e.g., Bluetooth, other wireless interface, etc.)?  Explain.
6.	Please provide any other comments or recommendations.
Please submit your responses through email to the Contract Specialist at Joseph.Pignataro@va.gov and Contracting Officer Charles W. Ross at Charles.Ross@va.gov.  Responses must be received by 12:00PM, NOON, EST on December 16, 2015.

<DESC>The United States Air Force, AFLCMC/Operational Contracting Division, Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio 45433-5344. This is a Sole Source synopsis published for informational purposes only. This proposed action is for the procurement of OE American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Certification. The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1).
<p>This proposed procurement will be a Sole Source under North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) 813920: Professional Organizations. Business size standard for NAICS 813920 is $15,000,000.00. <br />The proposed source is American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), 3141 Fairview Park Dr Ste 777, Falls Church, VA, 22042. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, quotation or exception to the intent to purchase on a sole source basis, which shall be considered by the Government if received by Thursday, 3 Dec 2015, 1200 EST. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>In order to comply with FAR 5.207(c)(15), the reason for lack of competition is as follows: The Government requires AIHA to provide Industrial Hygiene accreditation and Environmental Lead accreditation because AIHA is the only known source that provides the required accreditations. The government requires on-site analytical testing of the Occupational and Environmental Analytical Services (OEHTA) laboratory. Laboratories performing industrial hygiene sample analysis are required by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be accredited by an appropriate accreditation body certified by EPA. The testing includes the following:</p>
<p>1. Industrial Hygiene Annual Fee to provide accreditation to the OEHTA laboratory.<br />2. Environmental Lead Annual Fee to provide accreditation to the OEHTA laboratory.<br />3. Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing (ELPAT) to include Paint Samples, Soil Samples, and Dust Samples.<br />4. Industrial Hygiene Proficiency Analytical Testing (IHPAT) to include Metals Samples, Organic Samples, and Diffusive 3M Samplers.</p>
<p>The Department of Defense (DoD) has determined the System for Award Management (SAM) to be the single DoD registration for contractors who conduct business or who are interested in conducting business with the DoD. Contractors must be registered in SAM prior to award for solicitations issued after 29 May 2012. You may contact SAM by telephone at 866-606-8220 or online at https://www.sam.gov.</p>
<p>Any information should be e-mailed to mikinee.moses@us.af.mil no later than Thursday, 3 Dec 2015, 1200 EST. Only inquiries/information received by this date will be considered. <br />Be advised that all correspondence sent via e-mail shall contain a subject line that reads "OE American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) Certification". Note that e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB are designed to filter e-mails without subject lines or with suspicious subject lines or contents (i.e., .exe, or .zip files). Therefore, if this subject line is not included, the e-mail may not get through the e-mail filters. Also be advised that .zip or .exe files are not allowable attachments and may be deleted by the e-mail filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. If sending attachments with e-mail ensure only .PDF, .doc, or .xls documents are sent. The e-mail filter may delete any other form of attachments.</p>

<RESPDATE>010816
<CONTACT>Michael M. Gomes, Phone 4438614967, Email michael.m.gomes.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>1.0 Purpose<br />The purpose of this market survey is to gain knowledge of and help the Government understand vendor interest in participating in a Wideband Networking Waveform (WNW) Performance &amp; Interoperability Quick-look (WIQ) 4th iteration. Information gathered from this survey will assist the Government in determining Government personnel resources and specific test schedules required to assist vendors in the Performance &amp; Interoperability Quick-look events. This Quick-look event will allow vendors from both Government-funded and independent R&amp;D-funded programs to test their products with the networking waveform reference standard and other network terminals. The Government's intent of the Quick-look event is to enable a mature marketplace based on the most enhanced, operationally relevant, and sustainable tactical networking waveforms available.<br />2.0 Background<br />Program Executive Office Command Control Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) Project Manager Tactical Radios (PM TR) desires to create and sustain a Non-Developmental Item (NDI) Tactical Radio marketplace to support current and future full and open competition acquisitions (e.g. Mid-tier Networking Vehicular Radios (MNVR) Full Rate Production and Airborne, Maritime, Fixed Station (AMF) Small Airborne Networking Radio (SANR). This RFI is intended to support this objective.<br />PM TR envisions assisting vendors participating in the WIQ by facilitating vendor waveform porting of designated WNW variants. Further, the Government will provide all vendors meeting the entrance criteria in section 3.0 below with limited Government assistance in the porting of designated Government reference WNW v4.2.X software to vendor platforms. The location of the Government's assistance can be, at the Government's discretion, at the vendor's facility or at the Government's facilities, or a combination of the two. Porting assistance is intended to precede the WIQ4 test event itself.<br />The WIQ4 event is planned to be executed in two independent timeframes, 15-29 February 2016 and 22 August - 16 September 2016, with each timeframe having two phases. Phase I will establish the baseline reference implementation to compare to each vendor's host radio platforms with respect to the WIQ Test Plan (Enclosure A-To be released on 15 DEC 2015). Phase I will execute full system (end-to-end) performance based on homogenous network testing. Phase II will execute heterogeneous network testing with Government WRIL Reference Test Radio (Baseline Waveform Interoperability), Program of Record (PoR) interoperability, and multiple NDI vendor interoperability. Phase II will be an exercise to evaluate vendor Problem Report (PR) troubleshooting, root cause analysis, quality control, and documentation processes (Enclosure B-PR Process Overview-To be released 15 DEC 2015). The WRIL will witness and provide limited assistance to vendors' efforts to root cause, take correction actions, and document the PR process. All WIQ phases will be executed at SPAWAR Systems Center (SSC) Atlantic in Charleston, SC. Test reports will be provided to the participating vendors isolation will be provided for all proprietary test artifacts.<br />3.0 Entrance Criteria<br />(1) To participate in the WIQ4 event, vendors will be required to provide radio quantities, and ported waveform versions, as follows: Five (5) radios with WNW version 4.2 (or over the air (OTA) interoperable equivalent).<br />(2) Documentation to enable the Government to assess the vendor's likely ability to meet the following by 1 SEP 2015:<br />a. NSA User Partnership Program (UPP) or Commercial COMSEC Evaluation Program (CCEP) participation for Type 1 Encryption on a tactical radio or a valid application filed and recognized by the National Security Agency (NSA) for the same.<br />b. Standing or approved application for JTN or DoD Information Repository (IR) access and requisite Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) related to WNW with effective dates that run for no less than 10 months following the completion of WIQ4. Each interoperability Quick-look participant/vendor must provide all necessary ancillaries to operate the radio platforms in a laboratory environment, e.g., data/voice interface cables, power cables, etc. Each of the vendors must provide a plan to address loading radio configuration files and implement COMSEC and TRANSEC requirements. Any questions regarding these events and/or entrance criteria should be addressed with the Government Technical Point of Contact (TPOC): Brett Bendt, (843) 218-4543.<br />4.0 Requested Information<br />Interested vendors are invited to submit the system capabilities of their prospective software/hardware to include a summarized description of how they meet the requirements listed in paragraph 3.0. Additionally each vendor should provide a recommendation for schedule, location(s), and resources requested for porting assistance with respect to WNW v4.2. If a vendor is interested in participating in the subject test event but is not able to meet the entrance criteria as stated above, please contact the TPOC and PCO for further guidance.<br />5.0 Submission Instructions and Format<br />Interested vendors are invited to respond to this market survey by providing the following information:<br />(1) Name and address of applicant/company (Corporate/Principal Office)<br />(2) Name, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail address of point of contact<br />(3) Summarized description of how they meet the requirements listed in paragraph<br />3.0. Include current version of reference implementation for WNW supported by proposed vendor platform.<br />This is not a request for proposals. PM TR is only seeking sources through market research at this time to determine industry interest in participating in WIQ4. The Government does not make any promise or guarantee that by submitting a response to this RFI that the vendor will be selected to participate in WIQ4. The Government will respect proprietary markings submitted for this market survey. The Government requests that vendors segregate and mark proprietary documents. The Government will provide the vendor with an acknowledgement of receipt of its response to this RFI. The Government will not pay for any materials provided in response to this market survey or any follow-up information requests. Submittals will not be returned to the sender.<br />6.0 Submission<br />All responses regarding this RFI announcement shall be submitted electronically to the Contract Specialist Michael Gomes at Michael.m.gomes.civ@mail.mil in Adobe PDF format. All documents must be submitted by email no later than 4:00 PM EST on 08 January 2016.<br />

<DESC>Veterans Affairs Network Contracting Office 6 (NCO 6) intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Howmedica-Osteonics Corporation (DUNS:  058311945), doing business as Stryker Orthopaedics, pursuant to FAR 13.106-1(b)(2).  The proposed sole source contract is for two (2) kits of the Anchorage CP Plating System. The Anchorage CP Plating System differs in design from competing products in that it provides unsurpassed compression at the first metatarsal phalangeal joint specifically for patients who are both elderly, somewhat osteoporotic with low vitamin D levels, diabetics and non-compliant individuals who ambulate against medical advice.  The facility has used other first metatarsal phalangeal joint fusion plating systems that do not have the bi-cortical screw incorporated into the actual plate itself and have found that when the patient ambulates prematurely, the plate fractures at the level of the joint which was originally intended to be fused. The patient will have an increase in the amount of edema postoperatively with a less favorable outcome when the patient attempts to transition back into shoe gear.  Use of the Anchorage CP Plating System will provide the patient with the most conducive outcome to allow them to transition back into their normal shoe gear, with a diminished risk for plate disruption.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any responsible source who believes it is capable of meeting the requirement may submit a capability statement to the contracting office no later than Thursday, December 3, 2015, 4:30PM, EST. Interest/capability statements may be sent to Daniel Spaulding (contractor) at daniel.spaulding@va.gov.  No telephone responses will be accepted.  A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon the responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<CONTACT>OUSD AT&L/DPAP/PDI, Email osd.pentagon.ousd-atl.mbx.pdi@mail.mil
<DESC>1.0	Description
<p>1.1 The Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP), Program Development and Implementation (PDI) is seeking input on the feasibility of setting an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) 832 standard for vendors to upload catalogs for selling items to Federal Agencies.</p>
<p>1.2 THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) ONLY.  This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFP in the future.  Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI; all costs are solely at the interested party's expense.  It is the responsibility of the vendor to monitor this site for additional information pertaining to this requirement.  This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service associated with the information provided.  Further, DPAP PDI is not seeking proposals at this time and will not accept unsolicited proposals.</p>
<p>Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future Request for Proposal (RFP).  If one is issued, the solicitation will be synopsized on the Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) website.</p>
<p>2.0	Background</p>
<p>The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) chartered the Accredited Standards Committee (ASC) X12 to develop uniform standards for inter-industry electronic exchange of business transactions, namely electronic data interchange (EDI).</p>
<p>The X12 Transaction Set contains the format and establishes the data contents of the Price/Sales Catalog Transaction Set (832) for use within the context of an EDI environment. The transaction set can provide for customary and established business and industry practices relative to furnishing or requesting the price of goods or services in the form of a catalog.</p>
<p>The EDI 832 replaces the paper catalog, and is used by manufacturers to provide detailed product information to their supply chain(s), including retailers and distributors. The EDI 832 price/sales catalog transaction set is also used by commercial firms to submit the following to Federal Government Agencies: 1) a catalog of goods and/or services available to the general public; 2) a catalog of goods and/or services available only to Government entities; 3) sales information that is not available within a catalog; or 4) to identify special promotions.</p>
<p>The EDI 832 generally includes two basic sets of information: product information and prices. More specifically, the EDI 832 transaction can include the following information:</p>
<p>&bull;	Seller name and contact information<br />&bull;	Terms of sale information, including discounts available<br />&bull;	Item identification and description<br />&bull;	Pictures of items<br />&bull;	Physical item details including type of packaging<br />&bull;	Item pricing information including quantity and unit of measure</p>
<p>Recipients of EDI 832 transactions can integrate the data directly into their business software. The information provided in an EDI 832, such as minimum order quantities, case-pack quantities, etc., can then be used in the order process.</p>

Thompson, (904) 232-2016 <br>  <br> This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI).  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.  This announcement will be used as market research to determine industry's capability to perform the work as described below.  This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract.   <br>  <br> NOTE: Invitations for presentation may be extended to further communicate capabilities and performance deliveries of proposed methods.  <br>  <br> The Jacksonville District of the U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is seeking industry input for alternative methods to underwater rock blasting in conjunction with river/harbor deepening.  The purpose of this RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on equipment and methods that have been developed and subsequently utilized for river/harbor underwater construction projects.   <br>  <br> The proposed Jacksonville Harbor Navigation Project shall deepen the channel from its current 40 foot depth to 47 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) will also widen portions of the river by approximately 100 feet, (see attached Draft Specifications).  Note: The riverbed in the areas to be widened can be as shallow as -10 feet MLLW.  Borings have been completed throughout the channel to assess the material to be dredged and indicate said material consists of unconsolidated sand, silt, clay and rock.  The rock, which consists of limestone, sandstone and siltstone is mostly thin to medium bedded (up to 18 inches thick) and has an average unconfined compressive strength of 2,000 Pounds per Square Inch (PSI) and an average point load strength of 4,000 PSI.  The limestone is fossiliferous and vuggy with vugs up to 5 inches; however, locally the rock can have a strength up to 10,000 psi and can be thick to massive bedded (1 to  greater than  3 feet).  One method to break up the hard and massive rock is underwater blasting, however this method has environmental concerns and specific permitting requirements.  The government is seeking alternate methods to blasting, capable of utilization in an aquatic environment with strong tidal currents to a depth of -51 feet MLLW.  Of particular interest is the noise level (decibels) of the equipment at the impact site.  Alternate methods to blasting should include, but not be limited to, equipment utilized for the removal of underwater rock at minimal noise levels.   <br>  <br> Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. <br>  <br> If advertised, the solicitation would be issued as a Request for Proposal, Best Value and the resultant contract would be Firm Fixed Price. <br>  <br> No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing a response to this announcement or any follow-up information requested. <br>  <br> Request for Information Requirements: <br>  <br> 1. Alternate methods to blasting which can be utilized in an aquatic environment with strong tidal currents to a depth of -51 feet MLLW. <br>  <br> 2. Alternate methods to noise reduction (decibels) of the equipment at the impact site. <br>  <br>  <br> *Prior to submitting a response to this Request for Information, please thoroughly review the attached Draft Technical Specifications, Plans and Geotechnical Data Report (GDR)* <br>  <br> Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 2:00pm, EST on 5 November 2015 and shall be sent to the attention of Ms. Tedra Thompson via e-mail at  tedra.n.thompson@usace.army.mil.  DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY AND/OR BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL DATA.  NAICS Code is 237990 and the Small Business size standard is $36.5 million.

<p>(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible Offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>(i) Technical capability of the services offered to meet the Government requirement; and,<br />(ii) Price.</p>
<p>The importance of technical capability is approximately equal to price, when compared to price. Proposals will be evaluated in order of lowest-priced proposal to highest-priced proposal. Award will be made to the lowest-priced, technically acceptable proposal.</p>
<p>(b) Options. The Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the total price for all options to the total price for the basic requirement. The Government may determine that an offer is unacceptable if the option prices are significantly unbalanced. Evaluation of options shall not obligate the Government to exercise the option(s).</p>
<p>(c) A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful Offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>

<p>(1) The offeror and/or any of its principals ( ___ ) are, ( ___ ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency,</p>
<p>(2) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; and</p>
<p>(3) ( ___ ) Are, ( ___ ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and</p>
<p>(4) ( ___ ) Have, ( ___ ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied.</p>
<p>(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply:</p>
<p>(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.</p>
<p>(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p>(ii) Examples.</p>
<p>(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. Sec. 6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. Sec. 6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.</p>
<p>(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. Sec. 6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.</p>
<p>(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. 362 (the Bankruptcy Code).</p>

(END OF CLAUSE)

MARCH 12, 2010 							         VA HANDBOOK 6500.6
              APPENDIX C

VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY LANGUAGE FOR
INCLUSION INTO CONTRACTS, AS APPROPRIATE

1. GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

2. ACCESS TO VA INFORMATION AND VA INFORMATION SYSTEMS

a. A contractor/subcontrator shall request logical (technical) or physical access to VA information and VA information systems for their employees, subcontractors, and affiliates only to the extent necessary to perform the services specified in the contract, agreement, or task order.

b. All contractors, subcontractors, and third-party servicers and associates working with VA information are subject to the same investigative requirements as those of VA appointees or employees who have access to the same types of information. The level and process of background security investigations for contractors must be in accordance with VA Directive and Handbook 0710, Personnel Suitability and Security Program. The Office for Operations, Security, and Preparedness is responsible for these policies and procedures.

c. Contract personnel who require access to national security programs must have a valid security clearance. National Industrial Security Program (NISP) was established by Executive Order 12829 to ensure that cleared U.S. defense industry contract personnel safeguard the classified information in their possession while performing work on contracts, programs, bids, or research and development efforts. The Department of Veterans Affairs does not have a Memorandum of Agreement with Defense Security Service (DSS). Verification of a Security Clearance must be processed through the Special Security Officer located in the Planning and National Security Service within the Office of Operations, Security, and Preparedness.

d. Custom software development and outsourced operations must be located in the U.S. to the maximum extent practical. If such services are proposed to be performed abroad and are not disallowed by other VA policy or mandates, the contractor/subcontractor must state where all non-U.S. services are provided and detail a security plan, deemed to be acceptable by VA, specifically to address mitigation of the resulting problems of communication, control, data protection, and so forth. Location within the U.S. may be an evaluation factor.


e. The contractor or subcontractor must notify the Contracting Officer immediately when an employee working on a VA system or with access to VA information is reassigned or leaves the contractor or subcontractor's employ. The Contracting Officer must also be notified immediately by the contractor or subcontractor prior to an unfriendly termination.

3. VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

a. Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data - General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

b. VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor's information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA's information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA's sanitization requirements. VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

c. Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization. Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

d. The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies. If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

e. The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state. If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

f. If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

g. If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements. Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

h. The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

i. The contractor/subcontractor's firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA's minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

j. Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA's prior written approval. The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.

k. Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus. If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

l. For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.

4. INFORMATION SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT

a. Information systems that are designed or developed for or on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities shall comply with all VA directives developed in accordance with FISMA, HIPAA, NIST, and related VA security and privacy control requirements for Federal information systems. This includes standards for the protection of electronic PHI, outlined in 45 C.F.R. Part 164, Subpart C, information and system security categorization level designations in accordance with FIPS 199 and FIPS 200 with implementation of all baseline security controls commensurate with the FIPS 199 system security categorization (reference Appendix D of VA Handbook 6500, VA Information Security Program). During the development cycle a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must be completed, provided to the COTR, and approved by the VA
Privacy Service in accordance with Directive 6507, VA Privacy Impact Assessment.

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall certify to the COTR that applications are fully functional and   operate correctly as intended on systems using the VA Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC), and the common security configuration guidelines provided by NIST or the VA. This includes Internet Explorer 7 configured to operate on Windows XP and Vista (in Protected Mode on Vista) and future versions, as required.

c. The standard installation, operation, maintenance, updating, and patching of software shall not alter the configuration settings from the VA approved and FDCC configuration. Information technology staff must also use the Windows Installer Service for installation to the default "program files" directory and silently install and uninstall.

d. Applications designed for normal end users shall run in the standard user context without elevated system administration privileges.

e. The security controls must be designed, developed, approved by VA, and implemented in accordance with the provisions of VA security system development life cycle as outlined in NIST Special Publication 800-37, Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems, VA Handbook 6500, Information Security Program and VA Handbook 6500.5, Incorporating Security and Privacy in System Development Lifecycle. 

f. The contractor/subcontractor is required to design, develop, or operate a System of Records Notice (SOR) on individuals to accomplish an agency function subject to the Privacy Act of 1974, (as amended), Public Law 93-579, December 31, 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a) and applicable agency regulations. Violation of the Privacy Act may involve the imposition of criminal and civil penalties.

g. The contractor/subcontractor agrees to:

(1) Comply with the Privacy Act of 1974 (the Act) and the agency rules and regulations issued under the Act in the design, development, or operation of any system of records on individuals to accomplish an agency function when the contract specifically identifies: 

(a) The Systems of Records (SOR); and
(b) The design, development, or operation work that the contractor/subcontractor is to
perform;

(2) Include the Privacy Act notification contained in this contract in every solicitation and resulting subcontract and in every subcontract awarded without a solicitation, when the work statement in the proposed subcontract requires the redesign, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals that is subject to the Privacy Act; and

(3) Include this Privacy Act clause, including this subparagraph (3), in all subcontracts awarded under this contract which requires the design, development, or operation of such a SOR.

h. In the event of violations of the Act, a civil action may be brought against the agency involved when the violation concerns the design, development, or operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, and criminal penalties may be imposed upon the officers or employees of the agency when the violation concerns the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function. For purposes of the Act, when the contract is for the operation of a SOR on individuals to accomplish an agency function, the contractor/subcontractor is considered to be an employee of the agency.

(1) "Operation of a System of Records" means performance of any of the activities associated with maintaining the SOR, including the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of records.

(2) "Record" means any item, collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an agency, including, but not limited to, education, financial transactions, medical
history, and criminal or employment history and contains the person's name, or identifying number, symbol, or any other identifying particular assigned to the individual, such as a fingerprint or voiceprint, or a photograph.

(3) "System of Records" means a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.

i. The vendor shall ensure the security of all procured or developed systems and technologies, including their subcomponents (hereinafter referred to as "Systems"), throughout the life of this contract and any extension, warranty, or maintenance periods. This includes, but is not limited to workarounds, patches, hotfixes, upgrades, and any physical components (hereafter referred to as Security Fixes) which may be necessary to fix all security vulnerabilities published or known to the vendor anywhere in the Systems, including Operating Systems and firmware. The vendor shall ensure that Security Fixes shall not negatively impact the Systems.

j. The vendor shall notify VA within 24 hours of the discovery or disclosure of successful exploits of the vulnerability which can compromise the security of the Systems (including the confidentiality or integrity of its data and operations, or the availability of the system). Such issues shall be remediated as quickly as is practical, but in no event longer than ____ days.

k. When the Security Fixes involve installing third party patches (such as Microsoft OS patches or Adobe Acrobat), the vendor will provide written notice to the VA that the patch has been validated as not affecting the Systems within 10 working days. When the vendor is responsible for operations or maintenance of the Systems, they shall apply the Security Fixes within ____ days.

l. All other vulnerabilities shall be remediated as specified in this paragraph in a timely manner based on risk, but within 60 days of discovery or disclosure. Exceptions to this paragraph (e.g. for the convenience of VA) shall only be granted with approval of the contracting officer and the VA Assistant Secretary for Office of Information and Technology.

5. INFORMATION SYSTEM HOSTING, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE, OR USE

a. For information systems that are hosted, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA at non-VA facilities, contractors/subcontractors are fully responsible and accountable for ensuring compliance with all HIPAA, Privacy Act, FISMA, NIST, FIPS, and VA security and privacy directives and handbooks. This includes conducting compliant risk assessments, routine vulnerablity scanning, system patching and change management procedures, and the completion of an acceptable contingency plan for each system. The contractor's security control procedures must be equivalent, to those procedures used to secure VA systems. A Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) must also be provided to the COTR and approved by VA
Privacy Service prior to operational approval. All external Internet connections to VA's network involving VA information must be reviewed and approved by VA prior to implementation.

b. Adequate security controls for collecting, processing, transmitting, and storing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII), as determined by the VA Privacy Service, must be in place, tested, and approved by VA prior to hosting, operation, maintenance, or use of the information system, or systems by or on behalf of VA. These security controls are to be assessed and stated within the PIA and if these controls are determined not to be in place, or inadequate, a Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M) must be submitted and approved prior to the collection of PII.

c. Outsourcing (contractor facility, contractor equipment or contractor staff) of systems or network operations, telecommunications services, or other managed services requires certification and accreditation (authorization) (C&A) of the contractor's systems in accordance with VA Handbook 6500.3, Certification and Accreditation and/or the VA OCS Certification Program Office. Government-owned (government facility or government equipment) contractor-operated systems, third party or business partner networks require memorandums of understanding and interconnection agreements (MOU-ISA) which detail what data types are shared, who has access, and the appropriate level of security controls for all systems connected to VA networks.

d. The contractor/subcontractor's system must adhere to all FISMA, FIPS, and NIST standards related to the annual FISMA security controls assessment and review and update the PIA. Any deficiencies noted during this assessment must be provided to the VA contracting officer and the ISO for entry into VA's POA&M management process. The contractor/subcontractor must use VA's POA&M process to document planned remedial actions to address any deficiencies in information security policies, procedures, and practices, and the completion of those activities. Security deficiencies must be corrected within the timeframes approved by the government. Contractor/subcontractor procedures are subject to
periodic, unannounced assessments by VA officials, including the VA Office of Inspector General. The physical security aspects associated with contractor/subcontractor activities must also be subject to such assessments. If major changes to the system occur that mayaffect the privacy or security of the data or the system, the C&A of the system may need to be reviewed, retested and re-authorized per VA Handbook 6500.3. This may require reviewing and updating all of the documentation (PIA, System Security Plan, Contingency Plan). The Certification Program Office can provide guidance on whether a new C&A would be necessary.

e. The contractor/subcontractor must conduct an annual self assessment on all systems and outsourced services as required. Both hard copy and electronic copies of the assessment must be provided to the COTR. The government reserves the right to conduct such an assessment using government personnel or another contractor/subcontractor. The contractor/subcontractor must take appropriate and timely action (this can be specified in the contract) to correct or mitigate any weaknesses discovered during such testing, generally at no additional cost.

f. VA prohibits the installation and use of personally-owned or contractor/subcontractorowned equipment or software on VA's network. If non-VA owned equipment must be used to fulfill the requirements of a contract, it must be stated in the service agreement, SOW or contract. All of the security controls required for government furnished equipment (GFE) must be utilized in approved other equipment (OE) and must be funded by the owner of the equipment. All remote systems must be equipped with, and use, a VA-approved antivirus (AV) software and a personal (host-based or enclave based) firewall that is configured with a VAapproved configuration. Software must be kept current, including all critical updates and patches. Owners of approved OE are responsible for providing and maintaining the anti-viral software and the firewall on the non-VA owned OE.

g. All electronic storage media used on non-VA leased or non-VA owned IT equipment that is used to store, process, or access VA information must be handled in adherence with VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization upon: (i) completion or termination of the contract or (ii) disposal or return of the IT equipment by the contractor/subcontractor or any person acting on behalf of the contractor/subcontractor, whichever is earlier. Media (hard drives, optical disks, CDs, back-up tapes, etc.) used by the contractors/subcontractors that contain VA information must be returned to the VA for sanitization or destruction or the contractor/subcontractor must self-certify that the media has been disposed of per 6500.1 requirements. This must be completed within 30 days of termination of the contract. h. Bio-Medical devices and other equipment or systems containing media (hard drives, optical disks, etc.) with VA sensitive information must not be returned to the vendor at the end of lease, for trade-in, or other purposes. The options are:

(1) Vendor must accept the system without the drive;

(2) VA's initial medical device purchase includes a spare drive which must be installed in place of the original drive at time of turn-in; or

(3) VA must reimburse the company for media at a reasonable open market replacement cost at time of purchase.

(4) Due to the highly specialized and sometimes proprietary hardware and software associated with medical equipment/systems, if it is not possible for the VA to retain the hard drive, then;

(a) The equipment vendor must have an existing BAA if the device being traded in has sensitive information stored on it and hard drive(s) from the system are being returned physically intact; and
(b) Any fixed hard drive on the device must be non-destructively sanitized to the greatest extent possible without negatively impacting system operation. Selective clearing down to patient data folder level is recommended using VA approved and validated overwriting technologies/methods/tools. Applicable media sanitization specifications need to be preapproved and described in the purchase order or contract.
(c) A statement needs to be signed by the Director (System Owner) that states that the drive could not be removed and that (a) and (b) controls above are in place and completed. The ISO needs to maintain the documentation.

6.	SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

a. The term "security incident" means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

b. To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor's notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

c. With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach. Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

d. In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

a. Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. 5725, a contract may require access to
sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in
the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor
processes or maintains under this contract.

b. The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a "security incident" as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above. Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data. Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity
performing the risk analysis. Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

c. Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

(1) Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);
(2) Description of the event, including:
(a) date of occurrence;
(b) data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;
(3) Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;
(4) Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;
(5) Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;
(6) Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;
(7) The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);
(8) Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;
(9) Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;
(10) Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and
(11) Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.
d. Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $______ per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:
(1) Notification;
(2) One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least
3 relevant credit bureau reports;
(3) Data breach analysis;
(4) Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;
(5) One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and
(6) Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

8. SECURITY CONTROLS COMPLIANCE TESTING

On a periodic basis, VA, including the Office of Inspector General, reserves the right to evaluate any or all of the security controls and privacy practices implemented by the contractor under the clauses contained within the contract. With 10 working-day's notice, at the request of the government, the contractor must fully cooperate and assist in a government-sponsored security controls assessment at each location wherein VA information is processed or stored, or information systems are developed, operated, maintained, or used on behalf of VA, including those initiated by the Office of Inspector General. The government may conduct a security control assessment on shorter notice (to include unannounced assessments) as determined by VA in the event of a security incident or at any other time.

9. TRAINING

a. All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems: (1) Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;
(2) Successfully complete the VA Cyber Security Awareness and Rules of Behavior training and annually complete required security training;
(3) Successfully complete the appropriate VA privacy training and annually complete required privacy training; and
(4) Successfully complete any additional cyber security or privacy training, as required for VA personnel with equivalent information system access [to be defined by the VA program official and provided to the contracting officer for inclusion in the solicitation document - e.g., any role-based information security training required in accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-16, Information Technology Security Training Requirements.]
b. The contractor shall provide to the contracting officer and/or the COTR a copy of the training certificates and certification of signing the Contractor Rules of Behavior for each applicable employee within 1 week of the initiation of the contract and annually thereafter, as required.
c. Failure to complete the mandatory annual training and sign the Rules of Behavior annually, within the timeframe required, is grounds for suspension or termination of all physical or electronic access privileges and removal from work on the contract until such time as the training and documents are complete.

A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required.

In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<DESC>The Naval Supply Systems Command (NAVSUP) Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Norfolk Contracting Department, Norfolk, VA 23511-3392, intends to negotiate a sole source firm fixed price contract for the lease of a PLEXSYS Advance Simulator Combat Operations Trainer (ASCOT), with associated hardware, software and communications suite (PLEXCOMM).  This combined Synopsis/Solicitation will be done by utilizing the policies and procedures of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12.6 - Acquisition of Commercial Items and FAR Subpart 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  The requirement will be solicited as sole source procurement to PLEXSYS Interface Products Inc. as they are the only source capable of providing this equipment because the (ASCOT) and (PLEXCOMM) are proprietary to PLEXSYS Interface Products.
  The NAICS code applicable to this procurement is 541512  Computer Systems Design Services.  The size standard is $27.5 million.  The solicitation number is N00189-16-T-0071 and is issued as a Request for Quotes (RFQ).  This solicitation documents and incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through FAC 2005-84 and DFARS Change Notice 20151118.  It is the responsibility of the contractor to be familiar with the applicable clauses and provisions. 

The USS EISENHOWER Carrier Strike Group Four (CCSG-4) requires the rental of the ASCOT equipment because they will be conducting Fleet Synthetic Training from 11-22 January 2016 for certification training. This equipment will allow The United States Marines Tactical Air Operations to participate in the exercise and fully interoperate with joint and Naval Air Command and Control systems.
  The ASCOT equipment is necessary to provide a simulation bridge until the fielding of CAC2S Phase II.   

The solicitation, any documents related to this procurement, and all amendments issued will be in electronic form.      The solicitation will be posted to this site (Navy Electronic Commerce Online or NECO).  The NECO website has a submit bid button next to the solicitation number.  DO NOT use the submit bid button on NECO to submit a quotation.

All responsible sources may submit a quotation which will be considered by the Government.  By submitting a quotation, the vendor will be self-certifying that neither the principal corporate officials nor owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.
  Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the quotation.  The Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct verbal or written discussions with respect to other than price with the vendors at any time prior to award.  By submission of a quotation, the vendor acknowledges the requirement that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database prior to award, during performance, and through final payment of any contract resulting from the solicitation, except for awards to foreign vendors for work to be performed outside the United States.  Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a vendor ineligible for award.  Vendors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements by calling 1-866-606-8220, or via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov.
  Please direct all questions regarding this requirement to Mr. Quincy Gaines at either 757-443-1230 or quincy.gaines@navy.mil.

<p>This is a firm fixed price acquisition being conducted under FAR part 12 in conjunction with FAR 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures (13.106).<br /><br />__________________________________________<br /><br /><br />The Office of Opinion Research (OPN) of the U.S. Department of State (the Client) is considering commissioning a set of focus groups in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, and Brisbane on Australians' views of Muslims.  We would like to conduct the groups in the first quarter of 2016, with exact timing to be determined upon consultation with the Contractor.  Each focus group discussion shall last about 120 minutes.</p>
<p>The Office of Opinion Research will provide (1) the focus group discussion guide, a screening questionnaire indicating the criteria for selecting respondents, and a short follow-up questionnaire.<br /><br /><strong>PROJECT OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor shall be responsible for the following tasks: <br /> <br />1)	Consulting on the design of the screening questionnaire, discussion guide, and follow-up questionnaire with the Office of Opinion Research;</p>

<p>4)	Providing viewing facilities for observation of each discussion group by Office of Opinion Research staff;</p>

Recruiters should be closely supervised in the field during the entire recruitment process.  Fieldwork supervisors should be on hand during the scheduling of the focus groups and during the beginning of each discussion in order to manage any unforeseen circumstances.  Field staff should recruit at least 8-10 people per session to ensure 6-8 participants per group.  The Office of Opinion Research must agree to the final selection of participants before the discussion groups begin.</p>

This does not need to be a narrative report.  It can be provided in matrix/table form.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal Forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer.  If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. 

Election of Forum.  After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum.  If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.

The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protestor agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively.(c) Special rules. <BR> <BR>The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation.(1) Certain Stock Disregarded.

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.
Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <BR> <BR>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<p>7.	STATEMENT OF WORK</p>
<p>POSITION DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>USAID's Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local partners advance peace and democracy in politically-transitioning countries. In support of U.S. foreign policy, OTI seizes emerging windows of opportunity in the political landscape to promote stability, peace, and democracy by catalyzing local initiatives through adaptive and agile programming.</p>
<p>Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition.  OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations.  OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.</p>
<p>To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under U.S. Personal Services Contracts (USPSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office's programmatic goals and objectives. USPSCs are considered employees of USAID for all purposes except programs administered by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) - such as federally sponsored health insurance, life insurance, and retirement benefits.  However, there are several other similar benefits that USPSCs may participate in, such as partial reimbursement for health and life insurance costs, as well as full coverage of workers' compensation, among other benefits. For more complete information on USPSC benefits, please see page 17 of this solicitation.</p>
<p>For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: <br />http://www.usaid.gov/political-transition-initiatives</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>The OTI Country Representative based in Nigeria is a member of the Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA)/OTI Africa (AFR) Regional Team, and reports to the OTI Regional Team Leader or his/her designee. The Country Representative's principal responsibility will be the development, oversight and management of DCHA/OTI's Northeast Nigeria country program. The incumbent will be called upon to represent OTI's mission and programs to senior-level government officials, in-country visitors, and senior officials from other international organizations, bilateral donors, and local government officials.</p>
<p>Despite Nigeria's economic status and resource wealth, poverty, corruption, and conflict are endemic throughout the country. The main sources of conflict are related to poor resource management, corruption, and poor governance - shortfalls that are further exacerbated by the Boko Haram led insurgency in the northeast which has spread over the borders and into the Lake Chad Basin region that encompasses parts of Niger, Chad, and Cameroon. The violent Boko Haram insurgency in the country's northeast has been fomenting instability in Nigeria and threatening broader regional stability for some time.</p>
<p>OTI's Northeast Nigeria program seeks to further U.S. foreign policy objectives in Nigeria through support that diminishes the conditions that allow drivers of instability in Northeast Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin region to exist. Drivers may include, but are not limited to, violent extremism, political and economic exclusion, particularly among youth and marginalized groups, lack of state presence and/or good governance coupled with a lack of opportunities for political participation. OTI intends to address these critical issues through a flexible, small-grants mechanism that tailors approaches to the varied needs of communities in northeast Nigeria. The program may utilize both "soft" (e.g., cultural and recreational activities, media and strategic communications) and "hard" (e.g., small-scale infrastructure) activities to better connect communities, local actors, and the Nigerian government, and to increase youth resistance to violent extremism. The program may also support national level activities, such as election support, or other emerging needs.  <br />Due to the sensitive, fragile, and challenging environments in which OTI works, the office's approach to programming is one that seeks to find creative, entrepreneurial, and unique ways to approach problem sets. These dynamic contexts require that programs adapt to rapidly evolving situations and that teams continually explore assumptions and test innovative tools and methods to achieve program objectives. Given OTI's short-term political mission, its unpredictable working environments, and the diffuse problems it seeks to address, OTI has developed ways to get smart quickly and act fast. OTI has honed a program approach that uses iterative strategic planning where staff constantly review the current political situation, create relationships with communities and key actors, and undertake activities that will test what works and what doesn't in order to inform future activities and priorities. Core qualities of a successful OTI program are characterized by a team that is able to be fast, flexible, iterative, adaptive, and entrepreneurial.</p>
<p>9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<br />The work of the Country/Senior Country Representative requires teamwork, the exercise of discretion, judgment, and personal responsibility. As a member of a highly operational office, the incumbent is willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions to help ensure programmatic success. The incumbent has a high level of integrity and attention to detail to ensure the use of OTI systems and procedures to maintain effective and efficient management of funds, programming, and monitoring and evaluation. The incumbent is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change, and remains professional and respectful of colleagues and authority in a diverse workforce. She or he places a premium on the building of positive relationships with his or her respective team both in the field and in Washington, and with key stakeholders both in and outside of USAID. The incumbent is a team player, able to prioritize and follow up on their own actions without prompting, and fills in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The incumbent is highly responsible, service-oriented, organized, pays close attention to detail, and is able to receive and respond to constructive criticism in a professional manner. The incumbent is able to prioritize and complete tasks without follow up by the supervisor, while also filling in gaps as needed to ensure the responsiveness of the team. The Country/Senior Country Representative is a strategic thinker, articulates innovative ideas, presents solutions, and is a positive role model for colleagues both in and outside of OTI.</p>

<p><br />ATTACHMENT 1</p>
<p>ACQUISITION &amp; ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10<br />PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY<br />(OCTOBER 2006)</p>
<p>(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16 FAM 116 available at http://www.state.gov/m/a/dir/regs/fam/16fam/index.htm</p>
<p>Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.</p>
<p>(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."</p>
<p>(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).</p>
<p>(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:</p>
<p>(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;</p>
<p>(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and</p>
<p>(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.</p>
<p>(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.</p>
<p>(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.</p>
<p>(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.</p>
<p>(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.</p>
<p>(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).</p>

Flow down required in accordance with paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.247-64. <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

(4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check.

(f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement.

The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>Insert provision 1352.213?71, Instructions for Submitting Quotations under the Simplified Acquisition Threshold?Non-Commercial, or similar language in all solicitations for non-commercial purchase orders under the simplified acquisition threshold.

Flow down required in accordance with paragraph (d) of FAR clause 52.247-64. <BR> <BR>The Contracting Officer is the only person authorized to make or approve any changes in any of the requirements of this contract, and, notwithstanding any provisions contained elsewhere in this contract, the said authority remains solely in the Contracting Officer. In the event the contractor makes any changes at the direction of any person other than the Contracting Officer, the change will be considered to have been made without authority and no adjustment will be made in the contract terms and conditions, including price. <BR> <BR>The contractor shall comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations which deal with or relate to performance in accord with the terms of the contract. <BR> <BR>(a) Purpose. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. (d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. <BR> <BR>(e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507-1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future. Accordingly, the contractor may at any time seek a waiver from the Head of the Contracting Activity by submitting such waiver request to the Contracting Officer, including a full written description of the requested waiver and the reasons in support thereof. <BR> <BR>(a) An agency protest may be filed with either: (1) The contracting officer, or (2) at a level above the contracting officer, with the appropriate agency Protest Decision Authority.

(2) Investigative requirements for IT Service Contracts are: (i) High Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI). (ii) Moderate Risk IT?Background Investigation (BI).

(2) The Sponsor will ensure that these forms have been properly completed, initiate the CD-254, Contract Security Classification Specification, and forward the documents to the cognizant Security Officer. (3) Upon completion of security processing, the Office of Security, through the servicing Security Officer and the Sponsor, will notify the contractor in writing of an individual's eligibility to be provided access to a Department of Commerce facility or Department of Commerce IT system. (4) Security processing shall consist of limited personal background inquiries pertaining to verification of name, physical description, marital status, present and former residences, education, employment history, criminal record, personal references, medical fitness, fingerprint classification, and other pertinent information. For non-U.S. citizens, the Sponsor must request an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency check. It is the option of the Office of Security to repeat the security processing on any contract employee at its discretion. (e) Notification of Disqualifying Information. If the Office of Security receives disqualifying information on a contract employee, the COR will be notified. The Sponsor, in coordination with the Contracting Officer, will immediately remove the contract employee from duties requiring access to Departmental facilities or IT systems. Contract employees may be barred from working on the premises of a facility for any of the following: (1) Conviction of a felony crime of violence or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; (2) Falsification of information entered on security screening forms or on other documents submitted to the Department; (3) Improper conduct once performing on the contract, including criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct or other conduct prejudicial to the Government, regardless of whether the conduct was directly related to the contract; (4) Any behavior judged to pose a potential threat to Departmental information systems, personnel, property, or other assets. (f) Failure to comply with security processing requirements may result in termination of the contract or removal of contract employees from Department of Commerce facilities or denial of access to IT systems. (g) Access to National Security Information. Compliance with these requirements shall not be construed as providing a contract employee clearance to have access to national security information. (h) The contractor shall include the substance of this clause, including this paragraph, in all subcontracts. <BR> <BR>(a) Except as stated in paragraph (b) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End User License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (1) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (2) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (3) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (b) Paragraph (a) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. <BR> <BR>PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING WITH ENTITIES THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN INTERNAL CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS?REPRESENTATION (FEB 2015) (a)	In accordance with section 743 of Division E, Title VII, of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Resolution Appropriations Act, 2015 (Pub.

**Please Add Labor Categories As Needed

Answer:  The vendor is quoting all of the clearly identified scope of services found in the statement of work with the general over-arching scope of the contract being that the vendor provides Medical Physicist On-Site Services.  This being a highly regulated field there may be new regulations and or standards that may need to be met that may require the Government to purchase on an emergent basis.  The vendor would price emergent services with the use of this table.   The Labor Mix is defined as the types of personnel that would be required to provide the Physicist On-Site Services.

Question:  Does the Government have a suggestion for a way we can know that the Past Performance Questionnaire forms have been submitted? 

Answer:  The contractors may be carbon copied by individuals completing the past performance questionnaire, therefore knowing it has been submitted properly to the Government.  

Question:  In regards to the written reports, historically they have been provided in word or excel format, is that acceptable?  

Answer: Yes 

Question:  The Government asks for a hard copy binder at the end of the contract.  Could the vendor supply a CD with all of the documents on it, is a hard copy required?  

Answer:  No, a CD would suffice for this documentation requirement.

Question:  The ACR accreditation testing, the PET and SPEC are tested annually under the ACR standard however our scope asks for twice a year and quarterly testing respectively.  

Answer:  For clarification, the vendor is required to complete ACR accreditation testing at least annually with semi-annual and quarterly results assessment of the testing performed by our nuclear medicine technologists, respectively.

<DESC><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This is not a solicitation but rather a Request for Information (RFI) to determine potential sources for information and planning purposes only.</span>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">This request does not constitute a Request for Quotation (RFQ), Request for Proposal (RFP) or an Invitation for Bid (IFB), nor does this issuance restrict the Government's acquisition approach. There is no solicitation available at this time. Contractor proposals will receive no response. The Government will neither award a contract solely on the basis of this synopsis nor will it reimburse the contractor for any costs associated with preparing or submitting a response to this notice. The Air Force has not yet determined the acquisition strategy for this requirement, including determining if a set-aside strategy is appropriate. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">The purpose of this RFI is to conduct market research to determine if responsible sources exist and to assist the United States Air Force (USAF) in determining if a future contract effort can be competitively awarded and/or awarded on a total or partial Small Business Set-Aside basis. <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">The applicable </span>North American Industrial Classification System (<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight: bold">NAICS) code assigned to this effort is 334511 (Search, detection, navigation, guidance, aeronautical, and nautical system and instrument manufacturing) with the Small Business Size Standard in Number of Employees of 750</span>. If the Government decides to award a contract for this or a related effort, a solicitation will be published and posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website. The Government will use this information solely to determine the appropriate acquisition strategy for this procurement. The Government is interested in all small business concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt">Exelis is currently the prime contractor for the production of the PLM-4 Radar Signal Simulator (RSS) Accessory Kit Items (5963-01-508-8776EW Electronic Module, Standardized; 6130-01-509-0564EW Charger, Battery; 5995-01-514-5456EW Cable Assembly, Radio Frequency (RF); 6130-01-514-5455EW Adapter, Power Supply). Exelis owns the technical data required to remanufacture and produce spares. Parties expressing interest in this requirement must have the capability to access pertinent technical data needed for repairs, technical support, and contract program management. <br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: "><br />Note: This request for information is for the purpose of obtaining information relative to an upcoming manufacturing effort in the EW Supply Chain Management Squadron (408 SCMS/GULA) at Robins AFB,GA. The Contracting Office within the Air Force Sustainment Center will serve as the procuring organization. Companies are encouraged to provide responses to this questionnaire but are advised that their participation is voluntary and no reimbursement of any kind will be provided. Interested sources must have performed manufacturing services of the PLM-4 Radar Signal Simulator system in the past.</span></p>

<SOLNBR>W52P1J-15-R-MTSQ
<NTYPE>SRCSGT
<RESPDATE>122915
<CONTACT>John A. Purcell, Contract Specialist , Phone 3097821303, Email john.a.purcell15.civ@mail.mil
<DESC><br />Item(s): M772 &amp; M776 MTSQ Timing Fuze<br /><br />The U.S. Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI), Rock Island Arsenal, IL on behalf of the Project Manager for Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS) is conducting a market survey to identify potential sources to produce, manufacture, assemble, inspect, test, package and ship the M772, and M776 Mechanical Time Super Quick (MTSQ) Fuze. This is a market survey for information purposes only and not a request for proposal or announcement of a solicitation.
<p>Item Description: The following item description describes the M772 and M776 MTSQ Fuze in sufficient detail to respond to this sources sought.</p>
<p>The M772 MTSQ is used in production on the 81mm M819 RP Smoke Mortar Cartridge, and the 81mm M816/M853A1 Illuminating Mortar Cartridges. The M776 MTSQ fuze is used in production on the 60mm M721/M767 Illuminating Mortar Cartridges, and the 120mm M930/M983 Illuminating Mortar Cartridges. This impact fuze has a clockwork timing mechanism that can be set from 4 to 55 seconds in 0.5 second increments. The functioning of the M772 and M776 fuzes are identical. They only differ in size and shape of the fuze body. These impact fuzes are loaded with a detonator and black powder. They are composed of an impact device, a time setting device, clockwork, safety device, and firing train with an overall mass of 950 +/ 40 grams. The fuze safety pin is fastened in the locking sleeve which is part of the pulse-released safety device, and thus any release of the pulse-released safety device is prevented at extreme high loads.</p>
<p>The pulse-released safety device keeps the rotor in the out of line position (independent of the removal of the fuze safety pin) and prevents the clockwork from running down. The position of the rotor and the detonator ensures that the firing train of the fuze is pyrotechnically interrupted.<br />The pulse-released safety device consists of the safety pins with pressure springs, the balls and the locking sleeve with pressure spring.</p>
<p>The two safety pins retain the anchor thus preventing the clock-work from running down. Therefore, the engaging lever cannot be caught in the engaging slot at the spring housing, which is protected by the covering flap. The spring-loaded striker bushing is prevented from hitting the percussion needle by means of the release lever. The release lever is retained in this position by the engaging lever. The rotor is kept in the out of line position by means of the locking shaft, being itself caught in clockwork.</p>
<p>Requirements: The potential production requirement, subject to change, shall be a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract to support the U.S. Army, and Marine Corps requirements in the FY16-FY20 timeframe. The M772 and M776 MTSQ Fuzes have historically been produced and purchased from a single foreign supplier. The USG can only provide a top level assembly drawing, and military specification for each fuze type; a performance spec does not exist for either fuze type. The estimated M772 and M776 Timing Fuzes quantity to be purchased over the five (5) year period is up to 410,164 total.</p>
<p><br />Submission Information: A response to this sources sought should show adequate technical and manufacturing capability and the satisfactory past performance in the Fuze manufacturing industry. If a respondent does not have adequate resources (technical, manufacturing, personnel, etc.) available, the respondent must be able to demonstrate that they can obtain such, necessary to fabricate, assemble and inspect the required quantities of Fuzes and obtain the necessary equipment, facilities and tooling required to fabricate and deliver at a high rate of production. This may include an indication of willingness to invest in setting up a required production line.</p>
<p>Interested contractors should submit the following information:</p>
<p>a. Name of company, address and CAGE code<br />b. Point of Contacts, name, telephone number, and email address<br />c. Business size information<br />d. Location of the facility or proposed facility<br />e. A summary of their company's capabilities including parent organizations, name/address/point of contact identification, capabilities;<br />f. A description of facilities/equipment, manufacturing processes, inspection capability, personnel<br />g. Manufacturing past experience with Fuzes within the last 10 years;<br />h. Provide information relative to a proven monthly production at a minimum rate of 5,000 per month for fuzes. <br />i. Either possess or has the ability to acquire facilities with sufficient safety clearance to handle, store, and transport energetics materials; and<br />j. Possible partnering/teaming arrangements</p>
<p>The respondent should provide sufficient details to the U.S. Government so as to make a reasonable assessment on the capability to produce these items at the required rates. This information is for reference and planning only. The U.S. Government will not pay for any information submitted or for cost associated with providing this information.</p>
<p>All contractors interested in this potential future solicitation must be registered in the System of Award Management (SAM).</p>
<p>Proprietary responses will be protected in accordance with the markings.</p>
<p>This is for MARKET RESEARCH ONLY. Participation in this effort is strictly voluntary with no cost or obligation to be incurred by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this market survey. The information you provide will only be utilized by ACC-RI/PM-CAS in developing its acquisition approach. All proprietary and competition sensitive information should be clearly marked. Any information provided should be submitted electronically&nbsp;by 12/29/2015&nbsp;to ACC-RI, ATTN: CCRC-AC, John Purcell, 309-782-1303, email: john.a.purcell15.civ@mail.mil.

Quoters are encouraged to submit comprehensive quotations providing all listed outputs; quoters who propose less will be evaluated accordingly. While the Bureau houses the majority of its inmates in correctional facilities owned and operated by the Bureau, there are a portion of inmates who are housed outside of Bureau facilities in RRCs, state correctional facilities (termed long-term borders), jails/short-term detention centers, contract juvenile detention facilities, and private residences through home confinement authority. For the purpose of this synopsis, these inmates housed outside of Bureau facilities are collectively referred to as "Community Corrections Management (CCM) inmates." Services provided are expected to fall into general categories of inpatient and outpatient facility and professional services which conform to community standards and all local, state and Federal laws and regulations applicable to the delivery of health care to citizens of the general public to those CCM inmates located in the Mid-Atlantic, North Central, Northeast, South Central, Southeast, and Western Region. North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 524298 (Size Standard: $15.0 million). It is anticipated that each Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) performance period will consist of a base year from date of award (DOA) through 12 months from DOA. Additional information regarding this procurement will be distributed solely through General Service Administration's Federal Business Opportunities website http://www.fedbizopps.gov/. Hard copies of the solicitation will not be available. The website provides downloading instructions. All future information about this acquisition, including solicitation and/or amendments, will be distributed solely through this site. Interested parties are responsible for monitoring this site to ensure that they have the most up-to-date information regarding this acquisition. Faith-Based and Community-Based Organizations can submit offers/quotes equally with other organizations for blanket purchase agreements for which they are eligible. It is anticipated that the Request for Quotation will be issued on/or about Monday, July 13, 2015. No collect calls will be accepted. No telephone requests will be accepted. The quotations may be submitted in hard copy to U.S. Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Field Acquisition Office, U. S. Armed Forces Reserve Complex, 346 Marine Forces Drive, Grand Prairie, TX 75051, Attention: F.

<p>DLA Aviation, Richmond proposes to issue a Letter Request for Proposal (RFP) to add 39 national stock numbers (NSNs) on the Bell Boeing (3B1R2) corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9416, a long-term sole source contract which includes multiple NSNs to support various weapon systems. These items are being added to the Bell Boeing&nbsp;(3B1R2)&nbsp;corporate contract, SPE4AX15D9416, in accordance with the initially approved J&amp;A; however, the NSNs identified herein were not included in the list of original items synopsized for this effort. The pricing for the national stock numbers will be for option Years 2 and 3 of the contract. The contract expiration date is 09 February 2018. The contract requires a supply of parts with agreed to terms of FOB origin and inspection/acceptance at origin to DLA Direct stock locations. A total of 39 NSNs are targeted for this contract effort. It is anticipated that the total 39 NSNs will be priced for the award. The proposed action is intended to be awarded on a sole source basis to Bell Helicopter Textron Inc., CAGE 3B1R2.</p>
<p>It is the Government's intent to use a letter solicitation format to the sole source Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM); therefore, if a non-OEM source is interested in any of the NSNs, please notify the Contracting Officer prior to the synopsis closing date. These items have been identified as sole source; however, some items may have history showing awards to other than the OEM. Surplus dealers are also invited to respond to this synopsis. The response should include a completed surplus certificate, DLAD 52.211-9000, Government Surplus Material or adequate traceability documentation to show that the product is acceptable. (Note: Other Aviation sites must provide their equivalent surplus clause, as applicable). Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM should identify items of interest and include evidence of ability to supply the items for the contract period as identified. In addition, respondents should identify the quantity available and price. DLA will consider all such responses and may alter the acquisition strategy if purchase of existing surplus or newly-manufactured inventory is in the best interest of the government. Responses to this announcement from other than the OEM are required by January 15, 2016. A copy of the letter of interest should be forwarded to the contracting officer identified herein and SBA PCR (anne.mastrincola@dla.mil).</p>
<p>Additionally, letters expressing interest in subcontracting provided to the contracting officer will be forwarded to the identified Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM). This is proposed to be a FAR Part 15 effort. The attached 39 NSNs have been identified for the current procurement. If other NSNs are subsequently added, as defined by the terms of the contract, they will be synopsized separately. The Letter RFP issue date is Thursday,&nbsp;December 17, 2015.&nbsp;The anticipated closing date is Sunday,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>January 17, 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled Systems and Software Assurance Services (SAS) in support of NASA IV&V Facility in Fairmont, WV which was posted on November 3, 2015.  You are notified that the following changes are made: <p> FAR 9.5 generally addresses Organizational Conflicts of Interest (OCI).  When a Contractors judgment and objectivity in performing the contract requirements may be affected because performance has the potential to affect other interests of the Contractor, the result is an OCI based on impaired objectivity.  Given the systems and software assurance services contemplated under this Contract, it is possible that a Contractor with other NASA contracts could have an impermissible OCI resulting in impaired objectivity.  An OCI arising from other contracts currently held by a potential Offeror may render that Offeror ineligible for award of SAS unless the Offeror is able to propose an approach that fully mitigates the OCI.  In addition, as previously stated, the resulting contract will include a Limitation of Future Contracting clause.  To the extent a future NASA solicitation seeks products or services that are subject to review in performance of this Contract, the SAS Contractor would be ineligible to provide those products or services absent the COs approval of a detailed plan that fully mitigates the OCI.  <p> Offerors are encouraged to provide mitigation strategies addressing OCI concerns. Offerors should submit their strategies (not exceeding 10 pages) via e-mail to the Contracting Officer by December 11, 2015.  The goal is to provide feedback on the Offerors mitigation strategies before the issuance of the Draft Request for Proposal. Offerors will not be considered ineligible from competition if mitigation strategies are not provided.  <p> NASA Clause 1852.215-84, Ombudsman, is applicable.  The Center Ombudsman for this acquisition can be found at <A HREF="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/pub_library/Omb.html">http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/pub/p ub_library/Omb.html </A>   .  <p> The draft solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA Business Opportunities page is <A HREF="http://procurement.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=">http://procurement.na sa.gov/cgi-bin/EPS/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin= </A>   .   <p> It is the Offeror's responsibility to monitor the Internet site for the release of the solicitation and amendments (if any).  Potential Offerors will be responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

<DESC>GUIS Opal Beach Parking Lot/Road Removal

SYNOPSIS: The Gulf Islands National Seashore (GUIS), a unit of the National Park Service (NPS), has a requirement for the removal of two remnant, abandoned parking lots and associated road segments at the South Opal Beach and North Opal Beach in Northwest Florida.  On or about November 16th the Government intends to issue an invitation to bid (IFB) for a single, firm-fixed price contract for dismantling, demolition, or removal of improvements.  This beach enhancement restoration project will restore the natural viewshed to improve visitors' experience.   

LOCATION: Opal Beach Area of Gulf Islands National Seashore is situated on Santa Rosa Island along J. Earle Bowden Way (State Road 399), which connects eastern Pensacola Beach to Navarre Beach, Florida.  The project area is bordered by sensitive habitat and two wetlands.

SUMMARY: The contractor shall provide all labor, equipment and incidentals necessary to perform the excavation, loading and removal activities (to include hauling and dumping) a combined surface area of approximately 1.75 acres. All construction and demolition (C&D) debris shall be transported in a secure manner for off-site disposal or recycling.
  
C&D is defined in 62-701.200 (25) Florida Administrative Code 62-701.200 Definitions.
(25) "Construction and demolition debris" means discarded materials generally considered to be not water soluble and non-hazardous in nature, including but not limited to steel, glass, brick, concrete, asphalt material, pipe, gypsum wallboard, and lumber, from the construction or destruction of a structure as part of a construction or demolition project or from the renovation of a structure, including such debris from construction of structures at a site remote from the construction or demolition project site. The term includes rocks, soils, tree remains, trees, and other vegetative matter which normally results from land clearing or land development operations for a construction project; clean cardboard, paper, plastic, wood, and metal scraps from a construction project; effective January 1, 1997, except as provided in Section 403.707(13)(j), F.S., unpainted, non-treated wood scraps from facilities manufacturing materials used for construction of structures or their components and unpainted, non-treated wood pallets provided the wood scraps and pallets are separated from other solid waste where generated and the generator of such wood scraps or pallets implements reasonable practices of the generating industry to minimize the commingling of wood scraps or pallets with other solid waste; and de minimis amounts of other nonhazardous wastes that are generated at construction or demolition projects, provided such amounts are consistent with best management practices of the construction and demolition industries. Mixing of construction and demolition debris with other types of solid waste will cause it to be classified as other than construction and demolition debris.

Debris from a construction or demolition project that meets the current definition of C&D waste can be disposed in a C&D landfill or Material Recovery Facility.  The preferred option for managing any type of solid waste is to reuse or recycle the waste, whenever feasible.  Nonhazardous C&D debris is not federally regulated by EPA.  State and local regulations may limit where C&D debris can be disposed and may also require recycling a minimum percentage of the C&D debris generated. Visit www.cicacenter.org for more information.

DESCRIPTION: Work consists of the removal of debris in estimated quantities specified in the contract documents, which may include one or more of the following:

Interested parties are solely responsible for monitoring the above website for posting of the RFQ and any amendments that may be issued. The Government will not pay for the information received. By submitting an offer, the quoter is self-certifying that neither the requestor nor the principal corporate officials and owners are currently suspended, debarred, or otherwise ineligible to receive contracts from any federal agency.
 Failure to do so may represent grounds for refusing to accept the offer. By submission of an offer, the contractor acknowledges the requirements that a prospective awardee must be registered in the System for Award Management, (SAM), database prior to award. Lack of registration in the SAM database will make a contractor ineligible for award.

Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual certification requirements via the Internet at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/ 

Any questions should be addressed to Stephen Ngotho at Stephen.ngotho@navy.mil or 
215-697-9731.

The requirement is to provide professional services and logistical project support services in support of the Merida Initiative. These efforts include, but are not limited to human resources, general services operations, administrative support, data/records, overseas allowances, compensation, inventory management, business processes, project management, procurement activities budget management, finance and building applications.<br /><br />The $2.3 billion Merida Initiative, one of the largest and most sophisticated bilateral security efforts in the world, has enabled the USG to assist the Government of Mexico (GOM) with police professionalization, justice sector reform, crime and violence prevention, and anti-corruption efforts.
<p>In support of the Merida Initiative, INL is tasked to:</p>
<p>&bull;	Assist Mexico in developing more effective and transparent security and rule of law institutions, which work together effectively and cooperate with international partners to reduce threats from transnational and domestic crime, including terrorism, and improve border security and protect human rights.  <br />&bull;	Support Mexican state and society efforts to establish efficient, transparent, and accountable prosecutorial, correctional, and alternative justice systems institutions that respect human rights. <br />&bull;	Assist Mexico in improving federal, state, and local governments' operational ability to prevent and mitigate crime and terrorism, impact transnational criminal organization (TCO) cash flow, contribute to criminal cases against TCO leaders and members, disrupt TCO trust and corruptive relationships, and safely apprehend TCO and other high target offenders. <br />&bull;	Improve border security, including building support to the new government's efforts to secure Mexico's southern border. .</p>
<p>To meet the Congressional mandates of Plan Merida, INL programs in the region include the following objectives:</p>
<p>&bull;	Continue to support Mexican state and federal entities with efforts to institutionalize the rule of law among law enforcement and judicial sector operators, including through police professionalization, justice sector reform, anti-corruption, and border security initiatives.  <br />&bull;	Help Mexico achieve its transition to the new criminal justice system.<br />&bull;	Create a 21st century border structure, by further developing Mexico's capacity to detect and prevent smuggling of illicit goods and trafficking in persons.  Support networked technology systems and professionalization to strengthen Mexico's control of its northern and southern borders and ports of entry.<br />&bull;	Bolster Mexico's efforts to prevent crime and violence by supporting the establishment of resilient communities better able to withstand the pressures of organized crime through drug demand reduction, citizen oversight of security forces, and culture of lawfulness programs. <br />&bull;	Continue to build Mexico's capacity to disrupt and dismantle organized criminal networks, including capacity building to counter illicit finance and combat the production of, and trafficking in, illegal narcotics. <br />&bull;	Support the U.S. Embassy's second overall goal from its FY14-16 Integrated Country Strategy (ICS): to support Mexican state and society efforts to establish highly efficient, transparent, and accountable prosecutorial, correctional, and alternative justice institutions that respect human rights; to assist Mexico in improving federal, state, and local governments' operational ability to prevent and mitigate crime and terrorism, impact transnational criminal organization (TCO) cash flow, contribute to criminal cases against TCO leaders and members, disrupt TCO trust and corruptive relationship, and safely apprehend TCO and other high target offenders; and to improve border security, including building support to the Mexican government's efforts to secure their southern border.</p>

Thompson, (904) 232-2016 <br /><br />This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS AND NO CONTRACT SHALL BE AWARDED AS A RESULT OF THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. This announcement will be used as market research to determine industry's capability to perform the work as described below. This announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract. <br /><br />NOTE: Invitations for presentation may be extended to further communicate capabilities and performance deliveries of proposed methods. <br /><br />The Jacksonville District of the U.S Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is seeking industry input for alternative methods to underwater rock blasting in conjunction with river/harbor deepening. The purpose of this RFI is to gather industry-wide feedback on equipment and methods that have been developed and subsequently utilized for river/harbor underwater construction projects. <br /><br />The proposed Jacksonville Harbor Navigation Project shall deepen the channel from its current 40 foot depth to 47 feet Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) will also widen portions of the river by approximately 100 feet, (see attached Draft Specifications). Note: The riverbed in the areas to be widened can be as shallow as -10 feet MLLW. Borings have been completed throughout the channel to assess the material to be dredged and indicate said material consists of unconsolidated sand, silt, clay and rock. The rock, which consists of limestone, sandstone and siltstone is mostly thin to medium bedded (up to 18 inches thick) and has an average unconfined compressive strength of 2,000 Pounds per Square Inch (PSI) and an average point load strength of 4,000 PSI. The limestone is fossiliferous and vuggy with vugs up to 5 inches; however, locally the rock can have a strength up to 10,000 psi and can be thick to massive bedded (1 to greater than 3 feet). One method to break up the hard and massive rock is underwater blasting, however this method has environmental concerns and specific permitting requirements. The government is seeking alternate methods to blasting, capable of utilization in an aquatic environment with strong tidal currents to a depth of -51 feet MLLW. Of particular interest is the noise level (decibels) of the equipment at the impact site. Alternate methods to blasting should include, but not be limited to, equipment utilized for the removal of underwater rock at minimal noise levels. <br /><br />Magnitude of construction is between $25,000,000.00 and $100,000,000.00. <br /><br />If advertised, the solicitation would be issued as a Request for Proposal, Best Value and the resultant contract would be Firm Fixed Price. <br /><br />No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing a response to this announcement or any follow-up information requested. <br /><br />Request for Information Requirements: <br /><br />1. Alternate methods to blasting which can be utilized in an aquatic environment with strong tidal currents to a depth of -51 feet MLLW. <br /><br />2. Alternate methods to noise reduction (decibels) of the equipment at the impact site. <br /><br /><br />*Prior to submitting a response to this Request for Information, please thoroughly review the attached Draft Technical Specifications, Plans and Geotechnical Data Report (GDR)* <br /><br />Responses to this announcement must be received no later than 2:00pm, EST on 5 November 2015 and shall be sent to the attention of Ms. Tedra Thompson via e-mail at tedra.n.thompson@usace.army.mil. DO NOT SUBMIT PROPRIETARY AND/OR BUSINESS CONFIDENTIAL DATA. NAICS Code is 237990 and the Small Business size standard is $36.5 million.

LIMITED SOURCES JUSTI FICATION ORDER >$150,000
FAR PART 8.405-6

Acquisition Plan Action ID: VA243-15-AP-4918

This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Multiple Award Schedule Program. The material or service listed in par. 3 below is sole source, therefore, consideration of the number of contractors required by FAR Subpart 8.4 - Federal Supply Schedules, is precluded for the reasons indicated below.

Restricted to the following source:

Quality Services International, LLC 314 E. Commerce STE 500,
San Antonio, TX 78205



[8J The requested material or service represents the minimum requirements of the Government.

(1)	AGENCY AND CONTRACTI NG ACTIVITY:  Department of Veterans Affairs
Northport VA Medical Center 79 Middleville Road
Northport, NY 1176.8-2200

VISN:  03

(2)	NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF ACTION BEING APPROVED: Network Contracting Office (NCO) 3 intends to award a sole-source contract for snow removal services in support of the Northport Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC), Northport, New York. The performance period is for five (5) months, beginning November 1, 2015, or from date of award, and ending March 31, 2016. This action is for a total estimated dollar value of $750,000.00.

(3)	A DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY' S NEED:

(a)	The contractor shall provide all necessary equipment and personnel staffing to effectively maintain a snow and ice abatement plan for the campus for the upcoming winter, including all roadways, egress points from buildings, sidewalks and surface parking. Management of snow removal and stockpiling may be required as weather dictates. Contractor shall have a response time of no later than one (1) hour upon notification of service request.

(b)	ESTIMATED DOLLAR VALUE: $750,000.00

(c)	REQUIRED DELIVERY DATE:  November 1,2015, or date of award whichever is later, through March   31,2016.
 
Attachment 2: Request for Limited Sources Justification Format >$1SOK

(4)	IDENTIFICATION OF THE JUSTIFICATION RATIONALE (SEE FAR 8.405-6), AND IF APPLICABLE, A DEMONSTRATI ON OF THE PROPOSED CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS TO PROVIDE THE REQUIRED SUPPLY OR SERVICE. (CHECK ALL THAT APPLY AND COMPLETE)

[8J Specific characteristics of the material or service that limit the availability to a sole source (unique features, function of the item, etc.).

The procurement is a logical follow-on contract for services that were provided by Quality Services International, LLC (hereinafter referred to as QSI) under Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) contract GS-21F-0067V. NCO 3 had awarded a contract for snow removal for the period November 6, 2014 through March 31,2015 during which time the comprehensive, long-term requirement for consolidated facilities maintenance services (including snow removal) for Northport VA, was drafted. This solicitation has been delayed due to revisions and is scheduled for release November 2015: award is anticipated January 2016.

It is noted, while QSI currently provides interim facilities maintenance services for the Northport VA Medical Center under a 3-month extension of contract VA243-15-F-4539 (period of performance ends 12/31/2015), the requirement for snow removal was intentionally removed as performance is required for the entire winter season and breaking the performance period into multiple awards would result in excessive costs.

In addition, awarding a follow-on contract to QSI would save the cost of performing background investigation on a new contractor and eliminate the transitional period between contractors. Any other contractor would be required to accomplish the transition (including familiarization, training, and security screening and background investigations) in an expedited manner. Accomplishing this transition without sufficient planning and organization significantly places the operational readiness of the medical center at increased risk and would likely result in unacceptable harm to the Veterans which the organization services.

The award is essential to insure the critical services are available prior to the first winter weather event. QSI is a responsible source specializing in facility maintenance and is qualified to meet or exceed the minimum requirements of this acquisition.

(5)	DESCRIBE WHY YOU BELIEVE THE ORDER REPRESENTS THE BEST VALUE CONSISTENT WITH FAR 8.4 TO AID THE CONTRACTING OFFICER IN MAKING THIS BEST VALUE DETERMINATION:

Any other source required to accomplish transitioning efforts would require several weeks of transition to include familiarization, training, and security screening background checks. Accomplishing this transition without sufficient planning and organization significantly places the operational readiness of the medical center at increased risk and would likely result in unacceptable harm to the Veterans which the organization services.

The IGCE is based on previous service rates with prescribed durations, as well as the market research and IGCE analysis used for the long-term award. The provider will not be required to submit certified cost or pricing data as the services have been determined to be commercial services. The Government will conduct a price analysis in accordance with 8.404(d) in addition and evaluation of the level of effort and cost associated within the Statement of Work (SOW) and price proposal.
 
Attachment 2: Request for Limited Sources Justification Format >$150K


(6) DESCRIBE THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AMONG SCHEDULE HOLDERS AND THE RESULTS OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASON MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: Market research was conducted prior to the award of the current contract that QSI holds for the broader facility maintenance requirement. It was also conducted for the future solicitation for the same services.  However, it was not conducted for this particular requirement for snow removal services as an award to QSI for the term of performance is desired.

(7)	ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE JUSTIFICATION: No additional supporting facts for the justification.

(8)	A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS THAT LED TO THE RESTRICTED CONSIDERATION BEFORE ANY SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES IS MADE: The original plan was to have the Northport consolidated facilities maintenance award ready for October 1, 2015, but due to delays in the submittal, revision, and completion of the Acquisition Plan and draft solicitation, the projected milestones were significantly impacted and caused delay of the planned award. The snow removal services will take effect in the consolidated facilities maintenance award during the first option period and will be covered for all four option periods.

(9)	REQUIREMENTS CERTIFICATION: I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a Bona Fide Need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge. I understand that processing of this limited sources justification restricts consideration of Federal Supply Schedule contractors to fewer than the number required by FAR Subpart 8.4.
