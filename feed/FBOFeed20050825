<DESC>NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) has a requirement for a Laser Profilometry System for Hall thruster erosion mapping system  capable of measuring the wall erosion of a Hall thruster  ceramic discharge chamber without disassembly of the thruster and no physical contact with the channel walls.  NASA/GRC intends to purchase the Laser Profilometry System from Laser Techniques Co. (LTC) of Bellevue, WA. The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) (6.302), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. LTC has  developed and manufactured a  Laser Profilometry System for Hall thruster erosion mapping system capable of handling the wide range of NASA Hall thrusters from 200 W to 150 kW thrusters (diameters of 60 mm to over 1000 mm) without redesign for each application. Current  profilometry systems need to be redesigned for each application. Each redesign would involve new mounting hardware and software changes for each new thruster to be tested resulting in additional cost to the Government. The versatility and capability of the LTC system is accomplished by the proprietary technology of the LTC erosion laser profilometry sensor system which uses a small probe measuring the erosion of a surface without physical contact.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on September 9, 2005. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) is issuing notice of intent to negotiate a sole source procurement with Guildline Instruments for a laboratory salinometer. The equipment is needed to measure salinity from seawater samples to calibrate conductivity-based salinity measurements made during research vessel and ship of opportunity surveys. The North American Industry Classification System code is 334519.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  Accurate salinity measurements are critical to ensure the best possible measurement of salinity by the NEFSC for use in description of environmental conditions throughout the northeast U.S. continental shelf ecosystem. To meet NEFSC needs, the measurement range of the salinometer must be over at least 5-37 Equivalent Practical Salinity Units (PSU), the accuracy must <±0.002 (PSU), and the technology must be proven. The NEFSC has used a Guildline salinometer for over 10 years and successfully measured salinity from thousands of seawater samples. No other salinometers have a comparable accuracy and the Guildline salinometer is used around the world to measure seawater salinity when accuracy is crucial. The statutory authority for other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (1), Only One Responsible Source.  Interested parties may identify their interest and must provide evidence of their capability to provide comparable and compatible equipment by September 6, 2005.   No other information will be provided.  Telephone requests will not be accepted. Capability statements and supporting documentation may be faxed to (757) 441-3786.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.   Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Numbered Note 22 applies.

<DESC>National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Applied Research Program (ARP), Outcomes Research Branch (ORB) plans to procure on a sole source basis, services regarding Developing Software Program to Estimate Item-Fit Indices for Polytomous Item Response Theory Models with the contractor QualityMetric, Incorporated.  The North American Industry Classification System Code is 541990 and the business size standard is $6M.  The supplies and services herein are being procured in accordance with the simplified acquisition procedures stated in FAR Part 13.  The primary purpose of this requirement is to develop a Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS) module that will produce a range of indices for evaluating the fit of item response theory (IRT) models to polytomous response data.  The program will read-in both IRT model parameter estimates provided by various IRT model software programs (e.g., MULTILOG, PARSCALE, WINSTEPS) and the individual response patterns and will return a range of fit statistics including extensions of the S-X2 and the S-G2 tests for polytomous items and the X2* statistic. The program will also include tests for local dependence between item pairs.  To visualize misfit, the program will provide observed-expected plots of fit.  The software program will be user-friendly to allow psychometricians to easily input the required data, run the program, and interpret the results.  A users manual will also be developed to guide the researcher.  Model fit indices produced by the software program will be evaluated both for correct specifications as well as head-to-head comparisons for relative performance.  The development of this module will be compatible with the existing software.   QualityMetric, Incorporated, is widely regarded as one of the leaders in developing and analyzing health outcomes instruments.  They were one of the first to develop computerized-adaptive tests for health outcomes. The strength of their psychometric core is led by Dr. Jakob Bjorner.  QualityMetrics main research focus is on applying modern psychometric methods to health status measurement: development of item banks, new psychometric methods, and software applications for psychometric analyses and computerized assessment.  The team consulting with QualityMetric (Drs. David Thissen, Clement Stone, and Maria Orlando) have written software and published articles that have defined the area of IRT modeling.  Dr. Thissens IRT software program MULTILOG is one of the most heavily used programs among psychometricians.  The team also has extensive knowledge of test theory including IRT as well as the development of item fit indices for use with IRT models. This team has been instrumental in the development of the S-X2 and the X2* statistics which is the primary indices used in this study.  The assembled team of QualityMetric, Inc. are the only source known to the NCI that can provide the above services and superior products.  Changing variables at this time will be detrimental to the software currently developed.   This is not a request for competitive quotation.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirements they may submit a statement of capabilities.  The statement of capabilities and any other information must be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow NCI to determine if the party can perform the requirement. The contractor must also demonstrate knowledge and research experience in the field of psychometric modeling in health outcomes research and be able to deliver the same superior products.  Capability statements must be received in the contracting office by 1:00 PM EDT on September 9, 2005.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or sent via electronic mail to holdcram@exchange.nih.gov.  It is the vendors responsibility to call 301-402-4509 to insure all questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  No collect calls will be accepted.  In order to receive an award, contractors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This statement of work defines the requirements for a Congressionally mandated pilot study to move warning systems into the modern digital age   under which the Secretary of Homeland Security may issue public warnings regarding threats to homeland security using a warning system that is similar to the AMBER Alert communications network. This All-Hazard Web Alert Portal (AWAP) Pilot will be conducted with the National Association of State Chief Information Officers (NASCIO) as part of the DHS Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) initiatives. The IPAWS initiatives include: satellite and network upgrades to the Emergency Alert System (EAS), the Digital Emergency Alert System - National Capital Region (DEAS-NCR) Pilot, the Geo-Targeted Alerting System (GTAS) Pilot, and the DHS Web Alert and Relay Network (DHS WARN) Pilot. As such, NASCIO will serve as the Project Manager for this AWAP Pilot. The objective of this Pilot is to demonstrate how a non-proprietary AWAP, similar to the AMBER Alert communications network, can be developed quickly and in a cost effective manner to complement and be integrated with the DHS Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) and that could be used by the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue public warnings regarding threats to homeland security. Demonstrate through a pilot how an All-Hazard Web Alert Portal (AWAP) would securely accept warning information from official, authorized sources and then distribute that information to all appropriate systems that then broadcast or address the warnings to officials and citizens in the appropriate geographic region, based on their needs and interests. This pilot will be conducted in Washington State and must evaluate current commercial solutions and, where necessary, develop new AWAP hardware and software that:   (1) Utilize open-standards based software; (2) Utilize the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) for accepting alerts and sending alerts to dissemination systems; (3) Interface readily with the Emergency Alert System (EAS), the Digital Emergency Alert System (DEAS) pilot, the Geo-Targeted Alerting System (GTAS) pilot, and the DHS Web Alert and Relay Network (DHS-WARN) pilot; (4) Interface with established Federal and State emergency communication networks; (5) Provide input to NOAA Weather Radio and other NOAA dissemination systems through the NOAA HazCollect system; (6) Accept warnings for a wide variety of natural and man-made hazards from authorized sources including FEMA and IAIP generated terrorism warnings and warnings to be issued by State, county, and local officials; (7) Accept National Weather Service weather warnings and National Earthquake Information Center earthquake reports in CAP format; (8) Focus delivery of a wide range of warnings on those officials and citizens who need to know or are located in a geographic region that is directly at risk; (9) Provide warning information to national and local government and private websites for access by warning type, geographic region and time of the hazardous event; (10) Demonstrate how public and private alert and warning stakeholders, as well as individual citizens, can receive these official real-time alerts directly from the portal in a format that is relevant to them.  In addition, coordinate, plan, participate in, and provide support to the FEMA IPAWS Program Manager for all All-Hazard Web Alert Portal (AWAP) Pilot related meetings, to include providing meeting agendas and minutes consolidation and coordination. Provide interim and final All-Hazard Web Alert Portal (AWAP) Pilot Reports and PowerPoint briefings as inputs for FEMA to use in responding to Congress on the status and results of this pilot. The requirements contained within this statement of work shall be performed using resources and capabilities available throughout the United States but focused on Washington State.  In addition, hosted visits to FEMA headquarters and other government facilities will be required. Participation at project-related alert and warning meetings and data-casting vendor sites may be required.  The period of performance is for a six months period after award. This Notice of Intend is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, interested parties should submit a description of their capabilities and qualifications by August 30, 2005.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct competitive procurement.  A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses may be submitted electronically to the Contract Specialist email address specified below.

<DESC>This is a modification to the synopsis entitled BRAZING OF METALLIC/NONMETALLIC FABRICATED MATERIALS NNM04122136Q which was posted on August 11, 2005. You are notified that the following changes are made:  AMENDMENT 001 answers the following questions: Q1. What is the ceramic material, and does it have a specification?   A1. The ceramic material is Alumina 998. Q2. What are the specific alloy designations and forms for the metals (tantalum, molybdenum and copper)?   A2. No alloy, we request 3N or better for the sheaths as well as for the couplers. Q3. The functional requirements and operating conditions for the braze joints seem to suggest that the R&D is directed towards a particular application or type of application. Is that a correct assumption?   A3. We are not directing toward any specific process, so active metal braze or metallization is at the discretion of the company. If that is true, then is general information about the component designs available?  In particular, is there available information about design requirements for the braze joint, such as thicknesses and configurations of the components being joined?	The preferred joint design for the ceramic to metal braze will be an important consideration for the proposal.  The choice of joining process between brazing and welding for the molybdenum to molybdenum, or the tantalum to tantalum joints will be influenced, if not determined, by access limitations to the joint, hence the interest in configurations. Q4. In service, is the primary function of the joints to be a hermetic seal with minimal mechanical loading; or will there be thermal cycle induced loads from temperature variations in the service temperature range (227C), and perhaps launch vibrational loading?   A4. Hermetic seal minimal loading, max 30 psi internal pressure at temperature 7 psi typical. Q5. Are the "deliverables" for this brazing R&D work to be developed processes for the different material combinations, including joint designs, that meet the 900C exposure after a 30 minute (or less) ramp to temperature?  Or, are the results to be both developing the processes and a source to fabricate components?	 A5. MSFC deliverables include documentation of the brazing process and the brazed items. The due date for responses is not extended. Documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT


PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE NOTICE CAREFULLY.  THE 305th CONTRACTING SQUADRON, pursuant to this BROAD AGENCY ANNOUNCEMENT (BAA), SOLICITS CONCEPT PAPERS IN SUPPORT OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE AIR MOBILITY BATTLELAB.
A.  INTRODUCTION:  The United States Air Force (USAF) Air Mobility Battlelab (AMB) is the Mobility Air Forces (MAF) catalyst for innovation across the spectrum of MAF missions and skills.  We capitalize on links with industry, laboratories, academia and MAF professionals, to advance the USAF distinctive capabilities of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  Our primary focus is on identifying and investigating initiatives capable of being demonstrated in 18 months.  Through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA), AMB invites solution white papers with rough-order-of-magnitude cost and schedule estimates that address technological innovations and/or process improvements that reduce mobility response times, reduce deployable support structures, increase deployed combat capability and effectiveness, and/or enable USAF members to do their job more efficiently.  This BAA is issued under the provisions of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) paragraphs 35.016 and 6.102(d)(2) which provides for the competitive selection of technology demonstration proposals.  Contracts awarded based on responses to this BAA are considered to be the result of full and open competition and in full compliance with the provisions of Public Law 98-369, "The Competition in Contracting Act of 1984."  Responses shall reference Solicitation Number.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS EFFECTIVE UNTIL 30 SEP 05, AND WHITE PAPERS MAY BE SUBMITTED AT ANY TIME UP TO THAT DATE.  AMB considers submissions by evaluation of a five page white paper.  A copy of this BAA is also posted on the World Wide Web at http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm. 
B.  OBJECTIVE:  Technical Description.  AMB solicits innovative white papers addressing solutions to identified MAF needs.  AMB prefers to use contractor-loaned equipment or to participate in Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), but does have limited funding for demonstrations.  Ultimately, the AMB conducts operational demonstrations of innovative mobility concepts, evaluates their military worth, and presents its assessments to senior decision makers including the Commander of the Air Mobility Warfare Center, the Commander of Air Mobility Command, Commander U.S. Transportation Command, and the Chief of Staff of the USAF. 

Within the fields of Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support, current high-interest areas include:
 
·	Aeromedical evacuation enhancements
·	Air base opening capabilities
·	Aircraft threat mitigation
·	Autonomous landing capabilities
·	Enhancing aircrew situational awareness
·	Collaborative tools to facilitate C2 reach back capabilities
·	Expeditionary airbase/en route force protection
·	MAF/CAF interoperability, specifically organizational and process interoperability
·	NVG-compliant airfield lighting and NVG training
·	Precision airdrop and airdrop tracking
·	Real time in transit visibility 
·	Seamless and secure communication between MAF/CAF aircraft, C2 centers, and ground forces
·	Tactically-relevant aircrew training devices

AMB solicits white papers with the potential to enhance Air Force operations within any element of air mobility operations or their interfaces with the rest of the Defense Transportation System.  Submitters are encouraged to visit http://public.mcguire.amc.af.mil/AMWC/battlelab.htm to view a current list of AMB innovation areas.
C.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:  Submitters are required to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Number and reference the BAA number with their submissions.  Submitters are reminded that they must be registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at http://www.ccr.gov to conduct business with the Government.

Foreign contractors shall be aware that restrictions may apply which could preclude their participation in this announcement.  Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of concept papers and any evaluations.  Non-government advisors might be used in the technical evaluations of concept papers and proposals; however, the AMB will ensure that any non-governmental advisors execute a non disclosure agreement prior to participating in an evaluation.
D.  WHITE PAPER PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS:  The cost of preparing white papers in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost in FAR 31.205-18.  Contracts may or may not be awarded under this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA).  Every effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the white paper and evaluations.  The submitter must mark the white paper with a protective legend IAW FAR 52.215-1(e).

<DESC>The Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Construction & Equipment Directorate, is seeking proposals from business entities interested in participating in an acquisition as a Prime vendor for the roll out of the Facilities Maintenance Services Initiative.  The goal is to have a multi-service multiple award contract vehicle that would allow base facility managers to order services on an as-needed basis.  The initiative will encompass all services associated with facilities maintenance, repair and operations.  The areas to be targeted include but are not limited to: building repairs, roofing, paving, painting, plumbing, pipefitting, heating, air conditioning, locksmith services, elevator maintenance, electrical, glasswork, demolition, lawn maintenance, and facility operations.  The initial implementation was awarded in September of 2001 for the Northeast Region of the United States.  The first roll out was awarded in April of 2004 for the Southeast Region.  This rollout region is defined as the Southwest Region.  The target audience will include military bases and all other DoD and Federal agencies within the region.  The Southwest Region has been divided into three (3) zones as follows: Zone 1  Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah; Zone 2  Hawaii; Zone 3  Guam.  Prospective contractors should be able to adequately support services that will range from a minimum of $10,000.00 to a maximum of $50 million annually for Zone 1 and $10 million annually for Zones 2 & 3.  The maximum dollar value is contingent upon the number of facilities utilizing this initiative and the extent of participation of those facilities at any given time.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 238990, facilities maintenance services.  Subject solicitation will be issued on an unrestricted basis with the resultant awards being firm-fixed price, indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contracts.  It is DSCPs intention to award up to four (4) contracts per zone.  One of the resultant contracts in each zone will be reserved for a small business provided at least one responsible small business concern per zone submits a competitive proposal under this solicitation.  The performance period will be for five years, including a two-year base period and three (3) one-year options.  This will be a best value source selection acquisition in which technical merit is considered more important than price.  Oral presentations will be a part of the technical evaluation.  All information submitted is at the offerors expense.  The Government is not responsible for any aspect of transportation to or from the location for the oral presentation.  Solicitation number SP0500-05-R-0058 will be issued on 30 AUG 2005 with a closing date of 13 OCT 2005.  After the initial contracts are awarded, all services will be procured through the issuance of task orders, each one defined by a separate statement of work and, each one competed among the successful contractors.  All industry firms capable of accomplishing the required services are requested to obtain a copy of this solicitation that can be found on the DLA Gateway at http://progate.daps.dla.mil/home.

<AWARDEE>Futron, Inc., Springfield VA. This award is the result of a protest filed by Futron concerning how they were evaluated. After all facts were reviewed, it was discovered that Futron was improperly evaluated as an unrestricted offeror when, in fact, they should have been evaluated as an 8(a) firm. It was in the best interest of the Government to award an additional contract to resolve all issues.

<DESC>The Department of Health and Human Services, Program Support Center intends to award a sole source simplified acquisition to the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE), located in Boulder, CO, for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Center for Mental Health Services (SAMHSA/CMHS).  The authority for this noncompetitive award is set forth in FAR 13.106-1(b).  The purpose of this acquisition is to develop and implement a Virtual Grand Rounds series of electronic webcasts that focus on key professional development topics relevant for rural mental health and substance abuse practice.  This project is consistent with the mission of SAMHSA/CMHS and the initiative of the Presidents New Freedom Commission on Mental Health Report, Achieving the Promise: Transforming Mental Health Care in America, to address the needs of providers of mental health and substance abuse services in rural America.  WICHE is the only known source at this time that possesses the requisite capabilities to offer both the range of mental health and substance abuse training that is specifically focused on the mental health and substance abuse needs of rural Americans in WEBCAST format.  WICHE is a federally chartered Interstate Compact for higher education, founded in 1953.  As an Interstate Compact organization, WICHE is a regional governmental entity and has a government-to-government relationship with member states.  The WICHE Mental Health Program is unique in this integrated linkage to state governments, state mental health authorities, and higher education, and affords a very effective foundation to build workforce development efforts.  The Western Cooperative for Educational Telecommunication (WCET) is a parallel WICHE program.  An internationally recognized leader in the use of telecommunications in higher education, the resources of WCET are especially unique to this proposed project and adds a level of expertise simply unavailable to most organizations through such a direct relationship. Additionally, the rural mental health and substance abuse practitioner community looks to WICHE for its leadership in training and the delivery of training through webcast technology.   The period of performance shall be for a period of one year from the date of award.  The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 611430 and the small business size standard is $6 million.  Interested concerns may identify their interest and submit written documentation that demonstrates the ability to respond to this requirement within five (5) days from the date of publication of this notice.  This notice is NOT a request for proposals.  Capability statements received within 5 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Responses must be in writing and refer to 05M000235 to the attention of Susan Moran.  If no affirmative responses are received, the Contracting Officer will proceed with an award to WICHE.

<DESC>Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC), managing contractor of the Savannah River Site (SRS), near Aiken, South Carolina, for the U.S. Department of Energy, is soliciting expressions of interest from companies wishing to license or enter into a Funds-In Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to further develop a Dry/Wet Pneumatic Powered Waste High Lift Conveyance System.  Scientists at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) have developed a device that is a pneumatic conveyance system that is capable of dislodging, capturing, and conveying solid material, wet or dry, from a depth of 70 feet.  This device relies on pneumatic push technology rather than the suction technology that has been traditionally used in pneumatic conveyance devices.  While suction devices create high vacuum at the expense of high air consumption, this device utilizes a different design which creates a significantly stronger push on material and better material conveyance.  The advantage of this device over similar suction devices is its performance.  It provides the capability to carry the material to heights of 70 plus feet; suction devices are limited to 25 feet.  Any company interested in licensing this device or participating in a Funds-In CRADA must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by email) no later than September 26, 2005, summarizing the companys business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.  Qualified companies will be provided with further information on the technology.  Questions and expressions of interest may be addressed to John H. Olschon, telephone (803) 725-8125; fax: (803) 725-4988; email: john.olschon@srs.gov; or address:  Westinghouse Savannah River Company, Building 773-41A, Room #276, Aiken, SC  29808.  This is not a procurement; it is a request for parties interested in a Licensing this invention or participating in a Funds-In CRADA only.

<DESC>HEAVY EQUIPMENT RECOVERY VEHICLE M88A2 PERFORMANCE BASE LOGISTICS (PBL) MARKET SURVEY For ENGINE:  Diesel, Fuel Injection, 12-Cylinder MDL: AVDS-1790 Purpose: The purpose of the survey is to solicit your interest, current capabilities, and potential in performing the role of Product Support Integrator (PSI)/Product Support Provider (PSP) for Engine Assembly, Diesel Fuel Injection, 12-cylinders AVDS-1790 componen t of the Recovery Vehicle M88A2. The Government is seeking potential providers to perform in the role of Product Support Integrator/Product Support Provider for maintenance and logistics support concept for Engine Turbo AVDS-1790. Army Regulation 70-1 and DOD Directive 5000.1 identifies PBL as the preferred support strategy for material systems. The Army recommends implementing PBL on weapon systems and major components to increase operational readiness; increase reliability; enhanced logistics response tim e; enhanced deployment support; enhanced wartime support and reduction in logistics costs. The selected PBL provider will be responsible for some portion of the engine assembly logistics support, which could include, but not limited to, Depot, GS/DS maintenance, field and sustainment level maintenance and supply chain management (Parts support a nd delivery). The Army will retain responsibility for scheduled and unscheduled Crew and Organization maintenance. In addition, the Product Support Provider (PSP) would be responsible for recommending engineer change proposals and implementation to improve  performance and reliability.   PBL Definition: See Appendix A for Definitions of PBL and other frequent used terminology. Intent: Length/Type of contract:  Contract is expected to be a Firm Fixed Priced Contract for up to 5 years. Goal: The ultimate goal is to improve readiness, reliability, availability and maintainability. Our goal is to structure an agreement, which would incentivize the PSI to maximize subsystem reliability, thereby reducing maintenance and spare parts requirements in  the process. Desired Results and Outcomes:   Operational readiness 90% or better for the Recovery Vehicle. Desired/expected performance results from the PSP for the Engine assembly is achievement of efficiencies that drives the system to an increase in operational availability by reducing logistics f ootprint and reducing maintenance/repair time for unscheduled and scheduled maintenance. Proposed Measurements:  Level of performance shall be expressed in measurable outcomes and achievement of those outcomes by objective evaluation. Reduce Logistics Footprint: * Measurable reduction in the procurement time of sustainment level spare and repair parts to the requiring activity. Reduced maintenance/repair times; * Measurable reduction in the cycle time it takes to inspect, repair and return repaired component/subsystem to the supply system. PBL MARKET SURVEY QUESTIONAIRE 1. Name of Firm     Address     City, State, Zip Code     Point of Contact Name     Telephone Number     Email Address     Website Address 2. What would be your business approach to meeting these responsibilities for managing the AVDS-1790 Diesel Engine Government assets? 3. How would you propose meeting the goal? 4. What potential constraints or boundaries do you see with one PSP having ultimate responsibility for managing the majority of logistics and configuration support under a PBL arrangement? 5. How do you see the government measuring these specific areas for obtaining supply support, reliability, and maintenance?  What suggestions might you have? 6. What would you recommend as the approach to supply chain management in support of the AVDS-1790 Diesel Engine assets? 7. How would you approach performance of sustainment maintenance and reduce subsystem maintenance, both scheduled and unscheduled? 8. Would you be willing to provide this type of support under a long-term contract?    9. What would you do differently in support of deployment contingency (wartime vs peacetime) operations? 10. How do you foresee the price for a fixed level of PBL to be set up?  What would a fair payment plan/schedule consist of and how could it be linked to successful performance?  Response to this market research survey questionnaire should be sent via email to the following POCs: Mr. James Thompson, thompjam@tacom.army.mil Mr. Patrick Backus, backusp@tacom.army.mil  You can respond in total or to any part of this questionnaire. Any product literature that cannot be emailed may be sent to: Commander, TACOM 6501 E. Eleven Mile Rd. Warren, MI 49397-5000 Attn:  Mr. James Thompson, SFAE-CSS-FP-R, Mail Stop 354 APPENDIX A DEFINITIONS Performance Based Logistics (PBL): PBL is a product support strategy in which the logistics requirements are stated as expected results (outcomes), and wherein the responsibility and accountability of meeting these expectations fall on the Product and/or P rogram Managers (PM's), their designated Product Support Integrator (PSI), and their support provider(s).   PBL is: - Buying results not resources - Using performance specs not design specs - Buying solution or an outcome not defining the process and methods to achieve a    predetermined course of action. - About assigning responsibility to the supplier not the requiring organization. Performance Support Integrator (PSI):  The PSI is intended to identify a single source as being responsible and accountable for providing product support to the assigned Defense/Army system.  This is designated to an agency (private, public sector or a pri vate/public sector partnership).       Product Support Provider (PSP):  The PSP is anyone that provides a logistics/support product or service in support of a materiel system.  This term applies to all providers that have not been designated by the PM as the PSI.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to HITECH INSTRUMENTS, INC., 855 SUSSEX BOULEVARD, BROOMALL, PA  19008-4310.  The capabilities and features of ZEISS AXIOVERT 200 INVERTED MICROSCOPE are essential.  This microscope has the required functions that are highly important for our research:

1.	One of our requirements is the ability to perform at least qualitative polarimetry on specimenswith reflected and transmitted light. The Zeiss microscope incorporates Enhanced-Contrast Epiplan Neofluar objectives which are strain-free, i.e., do not introduce bias to the intensity of observed birefringence [contrast change from strain-induced polarization].
2.	In addition to the well-recognized mechanical stability of their platform and stage, Zeiss has incorporated a proprietary planetary focus mechanism in their focus drive. This becomes important because much of our specimen imaging will be at higher magnifica-tions (with correspondingly shallower depth of focus), where higher-accuracy and precision focusing is essential.
3.	For highlighting defects in translucent-to-transparent specimens, we will be using a technique called Differential Interference Contrast (DIC). The Axiovert 200 incorporates a proprietary enhancement: Circular DIC, enabling structures in various orientations to be visualized simultaneously.
4.	Because of the built-in features ordered with the Axiovert 200, at a later time we can upgrade the system to permit Circular Total Interference Contrast. This technology will allow sample step heights (z-axis) to be resolved in the nanometer rangea significant enhancement over conventional Mireau interferometry.
(PLEASE SEE ATTACHED LIST OF ITEMS)

An award will be made in ten (10) days from the date of this notice.  This is not a request for quotes; however, sources may submit descriptive literature, which fully demonstrates their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.  This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

<DESC>The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to LONG, JOHN ASSOCIATES, 14114 BRIARHILLS PARKWAY, HOUSTON, TX  77077-1004, for the acquisition of a Combo III Portable electronic nose (includes Combo of Pen-III and EDU-III). This equipment has high sensitivity sensors needed to record electronic patterns of the volatile components in food, in particular in foodstuff with low emission (flour, rice, bean, nut). The PEN-III electronic nose is based on 10 different metal oxide sensors (MOS-s) that give the highest response to volatile organics and are the least affected by the moisture content of the vapors. The small detector-size and the additional sample enrichment device (EDU-III) that ensures both high sensitivity and repeatability is a unique feature. The combination of these two (Combo-III) is the only portable (hand-held) MOS-based electronic nose available on the market.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

CQ.com provides comprehensive narratives of committee and subcommittee proceedings, including all open markups and many that are closed.  Includes tallies, and yea and nay breakdowns for recorded votes, voting records for members and vote descriptions for all votes.	Also, through this service verbatim transcripts of all covered congressional hearings, including NASA, are available within 12-48 hours.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Proposals should be on a firm-fixed price basis, including performance based metrics, quality assurance plans, as quality assurance surveillance plans.  A draft project plan shall also be  included for review.  A data migration guide is available upon request .  The requirements are listed below.   Statement of Work Department of Defense Education Activity Integration Support 11 August 2005 Section 1  Scope This statement of work (SOW) delineates software integration support required by the Program Executive Office (PEO) Enterprise Information Systems (EIS) Standard Procurement System (SPS) Joint Program Management Office (JPMO). Specifically, this support is  for the creation of a Procurement Desktop Defense (PD2) integration between the Department of Defense Education Activitys (DoDEA) purchase request application Comprizon.Request and the SPS utilizing the JPMOs centralized Integrated Development Environme nt (IDE), currently hosted by Evolutionary Technologies, Inc (ETI). Section 2  Background The SPS JPMO is in the process of developing and fielding a commercially based application to support the automation of contracting offices throughout the Department of Defense (DoD). In support of this mission, the SPS Program uses a XML-based WebMethods PD2 Adapter to facilitate integrations with other systems. Additionally, the JPMO uses the ETI Solution® Version 5 tool along with WebMethods as part of a standard process for rapidly developing and documenting integration efforts. The DoDEA provides education to DoD military and civilian dependents from preschool through grade 12. DoDEA operates over 200 public schools in 15 districts located in 13 foreign countries, seven states, Guam and Puerto Rico. DoDEA has four procurement off ices. The location of these offices is as follows: Headquarters (HQ), Arlington, VA; 30 contract specialists and over 100 requisitioners DoDEA Europe Procurement Office (DEPO), Wiesbaden, Germany; 25 contract specialists DoDEA Pacific Procurement Office (DPPO), Okinawa, Japan; 18 contract specialists DoDEA Domestic Dependent Elementary and Secondary Schools (DDESS), Atlanta, GA; 3 requisitioner/contract specialist users. The DoDEA has used CACI developed contract writing solutions for over 14 years, including legacy versions branded as SACONS and Comprizon.Buy. DoDEA is currently using Comprizon.Suite, a web based procurement system hosted at DoDEA HQ in Arlington, VA. Com prizon.Suite has both requisitioning and procurement modules  Comprizon.Request and Comprizon.Award. The requisitioning module is only used in HQ and DDESS at the current time. Section 3  Objectives DoDEA intends to retain Comprizon.Request as the agency wide requisitioning module and transition to SPS as its contract management solution. DoDEA requires an integration between the Comprizon.Request solution (internet accessible) and SPS PD2 Increment 2 . The following functionality is required: The Comprizon.Request submit function shall trigger the formal passing of an action from the Comprizon solution into the PD2 solution. The Comprizon.Request requisition will be taken into PD2 as an approved, funded Purchase Request. Data fields in PD2 shall be populated with all the information from the purchase request in Comprizon.Request. See the attached data element listing. The requisition number shall remain the same between the two systems. Support documents shall pull forward from Comprizon.Request to PD2. Support documents may be .doc, .xls, .pdf, cad files, etc. The status of the PD2 document shall be available and real time viewable by users in the Comprizon.Request appl ication. The objective of this SOW is to build a bi-directional interface between the SPS and the DoDEA Comprizon.Request to allow the deployment of the newest version of PD2 in a way that facilitates the DoDEA end to end logistics and contracting process. Metadata  relating to the new integration will be captured in the Governments ETI Solution® metastore repository.  Integration code will be developed using the ETI Solution® code generator and incorporated in the PD2 Adapter/WebMethods environment.   Respondents are required to demonstrate that they possess the following capabilities: Ability to effectively and efficiently use the ETI Solution® Version 5 toolset. webMethods 6.x development expertise and ability to integrate ETI Solution® generated code into a webMethods environment. Ability to host the ETI Solution® metastore and development environment in support of this project. Ability to utilize the Evolutionary Technologies methodology for data integration management. Understanding of the Standard Procurement System and PD2 Adapter business rules and DoD contracting in general. Respondents that do not directly address the above items in their proposal will be disqualified. Section 4  Tasks The contractor will accomplish the following tasks: Task 1  Develop the bi-directional integration of PD2 and the DoDEA Comprizon.Request. The contractor will participate in discussions with DoDEA PD2 and Comprizon.Request subject matter experts (SMEs) as required to understand and document the business requirements of the integration.  The contractor will develop a DoDEA Comprizon.Request translator using the PD2 Adapter, version 2.2, related PD2 Document Type Definitions and appropriate ETI Solution® tools. The contractor will develop and provide test scripts and sample files required for testing, and will support testing of the integration code at the Government Test Facility as well as onsite at the DoDEA Headquarters in Arlington, VA. The contractor will provide all code and documentation generated by the ETI tool as a result of this development effort. The contractor will provide all functional and technical documentation required to sufficiently document the integrations business process as well as all installation and configuration issues for the PD2 Adapter and/or WebMethods environment. Successful execution of these tasks will be demonstrated by the contractors ability to transform the files received from Comprizon.Request into the format required by the PD2 Adapter, and those produced by the PD2 Adapter into the specified file format re quired by Comprizon.Request. Success will be demonstrated by system testing conducted by DoDEA Comprizon.Request representatives. Section 5  Contract Deliverables All deliverables related to this effort will be provided to the SPS JPMO. The deliverables will include: Deliverable	Due	    Project Plan outlining tasks, resources, and schedule to complete  	DUE 5 - Days After Contract Award Functional requirements document describing the CONOPS for the PD2  Comprizon.Request Integration (including Final ETI Solution® Conversion Report)	DRAFT DUE - 15 days After Contract Award FINAL DUE - Upon Final Delivery All test artifacts (i.e., test scripts, sample files and production files).

<DESC>This Amendment is to notify that a List of Items will NOT be posted.  Please disregard the following sentence included in the original synopsis: (PLEASE SEE ATTACHED LIST OF ITEMS).


The Food and Drug Administration intends to award a Purchase Order on a sole source basis to HITECH INSTRUMENTS, INC., 855 SUSSEX BOULEVARD, BROOMALL, PA  19008-4310.  The capabilities and features of ZEISS AXIOVERT 200 INVERTED MICROSCOPE are essential.  This microscope has the required functions that are highly important for our research:

1.	One of our requirements is the ability to perform at least qualitative polarimetry on specimenswith reflected and transmitted light. The Zeiss microscope incorporates Enhanced-Contrast Epiplan Neofluar objectives which are strain-free, i.e., do not introduce bias to the intensity of observed birefringence [contrast change from strain-induced polarization].
2.	In addition to the well-recognized mechanical stability of their platform and stage, Zeiss has incorporated a proprietary planetary focus mechanism in their focus drive. This becomes important because much of our specimen imaging will be at higher magnifica-tions (with correspondingly shallower depth of focus), where higher-accuracy and precision focusing is essential.
3.	For highlighting defects in translucent-to-transparent specimens, we will be using a technique called Differential Interference Contrast (DIC). The Axiovert 200 incorporates a proprietary enhancement: Circular DIC, enabling structures in various orientations to be visualized simultaneously.
4.	Because of the built-in features ordered with the Axiovert 200, at a later time we can upgrade the system to permit Circular Total Interference Contrast. This technology will allow sample step heights (z-axis) to be resolved in the nanometer rangea significant enhancement over conventional Mireau interferometry.

An award will be made in ten (10) days from the date of this notice.  This is not a request for quotes; however, sources may submit descriptive literature, which fully demonstrates their capabilities, which will be considered by the agency.  This sole source procurement will be awarded as a simplified acquisition in accordance with FAR Subpart 13.5.

This is a combined synopsis/Solicitation for commercial acquisition prepared in accordance with Subpart 12.6 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. Solicitation number TAIP3500-05-90563 is issued as a Request for Quote.

Business Ethics workshops for Central and South America Statement of Work: The U.S. Department of Commerces (DOC) Good Governance Program works to increase market access and ensure a level playing field for U.S. companies operating globally. In Latin America, the Good Governance Program is currently working in Nicaragua, Panama, and Paraguay to promote good business practices and private sector leadership in fighting corruption. The Programs practical six-phase business ethics initiative builds awareness and dialogue on business ethics and transparency, provides skills and tools to enable the private sector to adopt good business practices, and helps build private-public sector cooperation to combat corruption.  The program assists the private sector to develop a general set of ethics guidelines that individual businesses may agree to adopt voluntarily and offers training and resources on business ethics.  More information can be found at:  www.ita.doc.gov/goodgovernance.  The purpose of this Statement of Work is to procure a trainer for a focused, approximately one week training on Business Ethics, to be performed in the three of the following cities: Managua, Nicaragua; Panama City, Panama; and Asuncion, Paraguay, with options for one week training on Business Ethics in Guatemala City, Guatemala and San Salvador, El Salvador. The proposed training will be a 4-5 day workshop with a select group of businesspeople (10-20 individuals) to develop an ethics program with an implementation plan for a small local business in the training country.  It is anticipated in the context of developing a code and an ethics program, that a thorough examination of related ethics issues will be undertaken.  Likely participants will include local private sector and non governmental organizations (NGO) representatives who are already active in the Good Governance Program and have some familiarity with basic business ethics issues.  All participants must commit to multiplying the knowledge gained in this training by giving workshops in their companies, business associations, and other relevant groups after the training.

DESCRIPTION/SPECIFICATION/STATEMENT OF WORK

1. BACKGROUND

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is in need of services to correct an erosion problem at the Memphis Internal Revenue Service Center (MIRSC) at 5333 Getwell Rd., Memphis, TN.

The general facility layout includes retention ponds that are designed to catch the storm water runoff. As a result of runoff entering the ponds due to the steep grading, there are areas of erosion starting to appear. These areas are concentrated around the perimeter of the facility at the fence line and at the retention/dry ponds. 

Perimeter (fence line) erosion: The erosion between two gates (gates 3 & 4) is concentrated at the fence line where the water drains to the ditch on the north end of the property. Because there is a high volume of water leaving the property at this location, the ground under the fence is eroding. This is creating deep ravines or cuts into the ground where the water is heaviest. 

Dry Ponds: The dry ponds are normally dry; however since they serve as secondary containment during periods of heavy rainfall, they may have water in them that will need to be removed at the time of scheduled work start. In this area, the steep grading is contributing to the erosion on both sides of the ponds. This is also causing the fence post concrete anchors to become exposed. The bottom of the dry pond will require leveling to restore proper drainage, as the soil runoff has deposited in this area and created high spots which prevent drainage. 

Retention Ponds: Around the ponds on the facility, there is rip rap to prevent erosion. The area between the grass and the rip rap is staring to erode, and the dirt has been carried down into the lower rip rap. Rip rap is needed in these areas is to fill in the thin spots. Additional rip rap is needed around the perimeter of the ponds to fill in the eroded area.

Estimates of the areas requiring services, to include the size of the ponds, are provided with specific tasks as applicable. It is estimated that backfill is needed for an area approximately 1 foot wide by 1 foot deep. 

7. SPECIFIC TASKS

PERIMETER. At the fence line between gates 3 & 4, the contractor shall:

	Install 3 drain boxes/catch basins and subsequent drain hose to move the water off site, along natural drain areas; fill swale with liner and river rock (The locations of the basins should be installed in accordance with the current fall of the land and swales).
	Install corrugated pipe (under fence) draining the drain boxes to the ditch that is to the North of the fence line.
	Install top soil to re-grade the area to proper drainage levels along the fence.
	Install a berm along the fence line to direct water into the basins to prevent future erosion (to the maximum extent practicable) and deflect water back to the drain boxes. 
	Install Bermuda sod over the top soil.
	Place rip rap around the drainage boxes to prevent dirt from entering the drains. 

NOTE: Gates 3 & 4 - This area covers approximately 350 feet along the fence line. 
 
DRY PONDS. At dry Ponds #1 & #2, on West fence line, the contractor shall:
	Backfill with dirt to reduce grade at both fence line and road side of ponds to reduce the potential for erosion.
	Lay Bermuda sod with staples over backfill dirt. 
	Form new backfill into current pond drainage slopes, correcting any current grading deficiencies which prevent proper drainage. 

Regrading in this area, creating a less severe angle of decline, will help the erosion issue. 

Pond #1: This pond perimeter is 700 feet, plus an additional 100 feet of fence line that needs to be built up.

RETENTION PONDS

Retention Pond #1. The contractor shall:
	Lay rip rap inside fence perimeter over eroded areas to prevent further erosion and provide security from entry via openings in the fence at ground level. 
	Build up existing rip rap at fence to level with bottom of fence line. 

Retention Pond #3. The contractor shall:
	Place rip rap around the perimeter of the pond to fill in the areas where the erosion has created excessive gaps in the landscaping. 
	Overlay rip rap over existing layers to fill in thin spots. 

NOTE: Pond #3 - This pond perimeter is 800 feet. 

The contractor shall add additional fill dirt as needed. 

RETENTION/DRY PONDS: Both ponds together equal approximately 1200 foot perimeter. This area is in need of buildup that will change the grade to a gentle slope, which will require an advanced knowledge of the grading principles to estimate the backfill required. 

8. SCHEDULE OF WORK
