MTS will provide in-transit visibility and velocity management of logistics and other Army combat support assets anywhere from the sustaining base to the theater of operations.  MTS will be used to support missions throughout the full range of military operations from peacetime to war.  MTS will provide commanders with near real-time data for location and status of logistics and combat support movement.  MTS will provide key capabilities to enable and enhance in-transit visibility and velocity management such as the ability to reroute supplies due to changing priorities, helping avoid hazards, and maintaining updated unit status.  The MTS capability will improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of distribution of resources and assets.<BR><BR>3.1 The Information Technology and Electronic Commerce Commercial Contracting Center (ITEC4), Department of the Armys contracting office, competitively awarded the original MTS contract in June 1999, with a follow-on contract awarded in August 2007.  The final option period on the current contract will expire on 12 July 2010. The FSC Code for the current contract is 5895.  NAICS Code is 334220.<BR><BR>4.0 ADDITIONAL REFERENCE MATERIAL:  The Government may make reference/reading material available.  If reference/reading material is made available, an amendment to this notice will be issued with instructions. <BR><BR>5.0 ACQUISITION OBJECTIVES:<BR>5.1  To the extent practical, the equipment shall represent state-of-the-art technology.  The current system provides in-transit visibility and velocity management of logistics from the sustaining base to the theater of operations.  MTS will support missions throughout the full range of military operations from peacetime to war.  It is a critical logistics communications and tracking system that provides detailed In-Transit Visibility (ITV) from the vehicle-level and provides the logistics soldier with navigational aids and a means for text communications from anywhere in the battle space.  The MTS satellite based architecture provides long-haul communications and tracking far beyond the capabilities of conventional line-of-sight technologies.  The follow-on system will start where the current system ends.  MTS fills the void that has historically existed and still exists today for logisticians.  MTS allows the means for unity of command through central control and monitoring of dispersed fleet assets; increased velocity through the direction/re-direction of critical, limited assets; and near-real-time logistical situational awareness through ITV of assets on the battlefield.  MTS enhances the capability of logistics distribution assets to survive and successfully complete their battlefield missions.  MTS does not displace or replace any existing communications, tracking, or logistics system.  Ordering for the current system ends in July 2010.<BR>5.2 The newest version of MTS incorporates the latest vehicle-tracking technologies, and new Automatic Identification Technology (AIT)  Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).  AIT-RFID will allow systems to begin delivering near-real-time insight into materials being transported by and in close proximity to Army vehicles outfitted with MTS.  The customer community for MTS is all common user logistics transport (CULT) and select command and control Combat Support and Combat Service Support tactical wheeled vehicles in the Army force structure.  MTS will support military operations on a world-wide basis in peacetime, peacekeeping and wartime operations.  MTS system components shall be capable of operating without the use of direct telephone (land line or cellular) connections or LAN/WAN/INTERNET direct connectivity.  The primary acquisition objective of MTS is to obtain a solution that efficiently, effectively, and economically provides and maintains a standard Information technology infrastructure to support the Government in meeting the MTS missions.  As such, the Government anticipates that some or all of the following objectives of this requirement will be as follows:<BR>	a.  Building on the current MTS solution (hardware, software, infrastructure) to provide a best-in-class, secure, interoperable, scalable, and upgradeable solution for MTS that focuses on a user-friendly interface.<BR>	b.  Ensure a seamless/transparent transition from the current MTS architecture to the proposed architecture and from the existing contract to this contract, improving current process standards and procedures.<BR>	c.  Under a performance-based arrangement, award to a contractor committed to delivering a highly reliable, user friendly, timely, and secure IT solution that meets or exceeds customer requirements and expectations.<BR>	d.  Provide evolutionary, robust and user-friendly enterprise portal Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) toolsets capable of integrating best of breed in messaging, work flow, position reporting, ITV and other services, as required.<BR>	e.  Assure that MTS services are provided to any operational MTS user anywhere, at any time  to include a network-challenged environment.  The system must be responsive and reliable to users at the network edge.  Provide responsive and competent user assistance available 24/7/365.<BR>	f.  Ensure security compliance/information assurance, including physical security, for MTS, its data, and users. Relevant guidelines include, but are not limited to, DoD 8500.1, 8500.2, AR 25-2, FIPS 140-2 and the Army Approved Information Assurance Products List (AIAAPL).<BR>	g.  Provide network architecture that is scalable to 100,000 users.<BR>	h.  Ensure MTS continues to operate at required levels of operational availability (including Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan (BCP and DRP) during any software or hardware changes, upgrades or disasters.<BR>	i.  Ensure new capabilities are adequately tested to prevent adverse impact to operations or the users experience during portal modifications and upgrades.  Provide user training to increase awareness of MTS functionality.<BR>	j.  Provide market research and recommendations focused on continuous capability improvements.  Provide a roadmap for future MTS improvements with an established and predictable release cycle.<BR>	k.  Provide Help Desk services for customer service and technical reporting purposes.  Operations should be 24/7/365 and available to all MTS users.  Offeror must propose performance standards applicable to this type of operation.<BR><BR>5.3. Consideration should be given to the following technical areas:<BR>	(a)  The vendor is invited to submit comments or plans on how the current/planned system computing environments will be leveraged to enhance vehicle availability, maintenance scheduling, or serve as a tool to aid in the remote repair of disabled platforms.   Given the digital age that our current fleet operates in, the vendor should be able to explain how they will leverage this digital sensor rich environment and likewise how the company would plan to compensate for the analog legacy fleet.<BR><BR>	(b)  The vendor is invited to submit comments as to how they plan to compensate for short term outage (blocked view to the satellite) and a methodology of providing 'mesh' coverage to non-satellite communications equipped platforms that belong to the same element or region or organization.  The vendor should document this plan of multi-path connectivity and include it as an expandable feature that could be bought separately from the base satellite coverage of the program.   This enhancement of multipath from a platform should also be looked at for bandwidth efficiencies, low priority traffic that could be stored for short terms and for short to intermediate distance (1KM - 5KM) coverage.    This redundancy if enacted should be able to independently perform (satellite blocked), perform in concert with the satellite communications (priority based) or perform only as needed (standby). <BR><BR>	(c)  The vendor is invited to submit comments or plans on the use of Joint Variable Message Format (JVMF) and informational products from the available and emerging battle command systems to provide the MTS user and control station operator an unclassified situational awareness (SA) for force protection.   The products include overlays, symbology, geo-fencing and non-tracked unit/organization information.  Any plan should include a methodology informational management of these products (e.g. - keeping the products versioned and updated across a wide area dispersed fleet that isn't always on the network, but still require the information once brought on line).<BR><BR>6.0 ACQUISITION STRATEGY ISSUES:  Sources will be expected to provide hardware, software, installation, training, post-installation support, and satellite services worldwide.  This support effort includes, but is not limited to: program management, requirements definition, technology insertion, systems development and procurement, systems integration, installation, fabrication, testing, evaluation, certification, studies and analysis, technical data management, configuration management, operations, maintenance and logistics support, training, site surveys, engineering studies and documentation, integration/interface impact studies, relocation of equipment, CONUS and OCONUS shipping, development of A-Kits for several different vehicle-types, demonstration support, and, briefing support.  The Government is looking for the ability to fulfill the above requirements, plus incorporate existing fielded systems within the proposed architecture.<BR><BR>7.0  PERFORMANCE-BASED ACQUISITION (PBA):  The MTS contract, if awarded, may use performance-based service contracting principles including use of a Statement of Objectives or a Performance Work Statement.<BR><BR>8.0 QUESTIONS FOR INDUSTRY RESPONSE:  The Government is requesting comments on the above options, and is interested in obtaining the following information from industry to consider in determining its acquisition strategy and development of the RFP: <BR><BR>8.1  How difficult would it be to implement a solution in which the Government provides a limited set of equipment as GFE?  In this event the Government would likely not be in a position to acquire or lease all equipment necessary for MTS to function.  Rather, the contractor would be required to provide MTS as a service using its own resources.  Please explain the advantages and disadvantages with this approach.<BR><BR>8.2  With regards to FAR Subpart 27, what other factors should be considered regarding software licenses and Configuration Management?  How would you recommend handling software licenses issues and any software that might be developed/enhanced under this effort?<BR><BR>8.3  What specific detail or additional information beyond the information provided in the reading room is needed in order to bid on the complete requirement?<BR><BR>8.4  What contract type(s) would be most beneficial to both the Government and the contractor?<BR><BR>8.5  How long would it take to transition from the existing contract to the new contract?<BR><BR>8.6  What logical portions of work are suitable for small business (SB) participation on an effort of this size?  What SB subcontracting goals have you achieved on similar efforts?<BR><BR>8.7  What contractual incentives would motivate outstanding performance?  In what areas can performance most effectively be incentivized?<BR><BR>8.8  How would you monitor MTS service availability and quality?<BR><BR>8.9  With regards to future trends, what should the Government consider in assessing future capabilities?<BR><BR>8.10	Does your organization have the resources and expertise available to perform the complex analysis of the MTS system needed to model system capacity and performance?  Such analysis would include link budget analysis, interference analysis, network capacity modeling, identifying bottlenecks in the system, and determination of the best satellite bandwidth options for a given area.<BR><BR>9.0 VENDOR QUESTIONS:  Any questions regarding this RFI should be submitted via e-mail to the addressees listed above NOT LATER THAN close of business on Thursday, 12 February 2009.  If any questions are received, responses will be consolidated and posted as an amendment to this notice.  Telephonic questions will not be accepted. <BR>                                     End of RFI<BR>

<DESC><p>
<p>FDA Number: 12.800</p>
<p>I. FUNDING OPPORTUNITY DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The AFRL information management architecture requires a scalable robust fault tolerant repository that can be integrated with other information management services. The scalable fault tolerant repository must be based on multiple distributed repositories, manage information based on a managed information object, and operate within the tactical environment. The objective of this effort is to research, develop and demonstrate a scalable fault tolerant repository that can support a distributed information management capability based upon Managed Information Objects (MIOs). An MIO comprises three elements: a type specifier, metadata to characterize the MIO (to support query or other information management functions) and a payload of arbitrary data content. This effort will research and develop methods to ensure that a scalable robust archive infrastructure be developed that meets a minimum set of functional requirements and operate as a distributed repository on unreliable networks with high latency, low to moderate bandwidth and occasional dropouts. The results are expected to establish a sound technical approach to provide the warfighter with new and improved access to information in tactical environments.</p>
<p>II. AWARD INFORMATION:</p>
<p>Total funding for this BAA is approximately $1.5M. The anticipated funding to be obligated under this BAA is broken out by fiscal year as follows: FY 09 - $500K and FY 10 - $1M. Individual awards will not normally exceed 12 months with dollar amounts normally ranging between $200K to $300K per year. There is also the potential to make awards up to any dollar value. Awards of efforts as a result of this announcement will be in the form of contracts, grants or cooperative agreements depending upon the nature of the work proposed.</p>
<p>Two phase one efforts are anticipated to develop initial design concept with appropriate analysis and trade studies to validate the approach. A critical element of the phase one effort will be experimentation and analysis to serve as a risk reduction validation for the eventual scalable fault tolerant repository. A single phase two effort, which will complete the design and implement repository, will be selected from one of the phase one efforts.</p>
<p>III. ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS: All potential applicants are eligible. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors are advised that their participation is subject to foreign disclosure review procedures. Foreign or foreign-owned offerors should immediately contact the contracting office focal point, Lynn G. White, Contracting Officer, telephone (315) 330-4996 or e-mail Lynn.White@rl.af.mil for information if they contemplate responding. The e-mail must reference the title and BAA 09-06-RIKA.</p>
<p>2. COST SHARING OR MATCHING: Cost sharing is not a requirement.</p>

<p>2. CONTENT AND FORM OF SUBMISSION: Offerors are required to submit 3 copies of a 2 to 4 page white paper summarizing their proposed approach/solution.

Multiple white papers within the purview of this announcement may be submitted by each offeror. If the offeror wishes to restrict its white papers/proposals, they must be marked with the restrictive language stated in FAR 15.609(a) and (b). All white papers/proposals shall be double spaced with a font no smaller than 12 pitch. In addition, respondents are requested to provide their Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) number, their Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number, a fax number, an e-mail address, and reference BAA 09-06-RIKA with their submission.

<p>3. SUBMISSION DATES AND TIMES: To maximize the possibility of award, white papers must be received by 2pm Eastern time on 25 Mar 09. FORMAL PROPOSALS ARE NOT BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME.</p>
<p><br />4. FUNDING RESTRICTIONS: The cost of preparing white papers/proposals in response to this announcement is not considered an allowable direct charge to any resulting contract or any other contract, but may be an allowable expense to the normal bid and proposal indirect cost specified in FAR 31.205-18. Incurring pre-award costs for ASSISTANCE INSTRUMENTS ONLY are regulated by the DoD Grant and Agreements Regulations (DODGARS).</p>
<p><br />5. CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE FOR WHITE PAPER SUBMISSIONS: AFRL/RISE will accept classified responses to this BAA when the classification is mandated by classification guidance provided by an Original Classification Authority of the U.S. Government, or when the proposer believes the work, if successful, would merit classification. Security classification guidance in the form of a DD Form 254 (DoD Contract Security Classification Specification) will not be provided at this time since AFRL is soliciting ideas only. Proposers that intend to include classified information or data in their white paper submission or who are unsure about the appropriate classification of their white papers should contact the technical point of contact listed in Section VII for guidance and direction in advance of preparation.</p>
<p>6. All Proposers should review the NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM OPERATING MANUAL, (NISPOM), dated February 28, 2006 as it provides baseline standards for the protection of classified information and prescribes the requirements concerning Contractor Developed Information under paragraph 4-105.

<p>7. OTHER SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: DO NOT send white papers to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>All responses to this announcement must be addressed to ATTN: Robert M. Flo, AFRL/RISE, 525 Brooks Road, Rome, NY 13441-4505.</p>
<p>V. APPLICATION REVIEW INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. CRITERIA: The following criteria, in which criteria 1-3 are of equal importance and criteria 4 is of lesser importance than criteria 1-3, will be used to determine whether white papers and proposals submitted are consistent with the intent of this BAA and of interest to the Government: (1) Overall Scientific and Technical Merit -- The overall scientific and/or technical merits of the proposal, including the approach for the development and/or enhancement of the proposed technology and its evaluation; (2) Related Experience - The extent to which the offeror demonstrates relevant technology and domain knowledge, the offeror's capabilities, related experience, facilities, techniques, or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposed objectives; as well as the qualification, capabilities and experience of the proposed principal investigator, team leader, and other key personnel who are critical to achieving the proposed objectives; (3) Openness/Maturity of Solution - The extent to which existing capabilities and standards are leveraged and the relative maturity of the proposed technology in terms of reliability and robustness and (4) Reasonableness and realism of proposed costs and fees, if any. No further evaluation criteria will be used in selecting white papers/proposals. Individual white paper/proposal evaluations will be evaluated against the evaluation criteria without regard to other white papers and proposals submitted under this BAA. White papers and proposals submitted will be evaluated as they are received.</p>
<p>2. REVIEW AND SELECTION PROCESS: Only Government employees will evaluate the white papers/proposals for selection. The Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate has contracted for various business and staff support services, some of which require contractors to obtain administrative access to proprietary information submitted by other contractors. Administrative access is defined as "handling or having physical control over information for the sole purpose of accomplishing the administrative functions specified in the administrative support contract, which do not require the review, reading, or comprehension of the content of the information on the part of non-technical professionals assigned to accomplish the specified administrative tasks." These contractors have signed general non-disclosure agreements and organizational conflict of interest statements. The required administrative access will be granted to non-technical professionals. Examples of the administrative tasks performed include: a. Assembling and organizing information for R&amp;D case files; b. Accessing library files for use by government personnel; and c. Handling and administration of proposals, contracts, contract funding and queries. Any objection to administrative access must be in writing to the Contracting Officer and shall include a detailed statement of the basis for the objection.</p>
<p>VI. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION:</p>
<p>1. AWARD NOTICES: Those white papers found to be consistent with the intent of this BAA may be invited to submit a technical and cost proposal. Notification by email or letter will be sent by the technical POC. Such invitation does not assure that the submitting organization will be awarded a contract. Those white papers not selected to submit a proposal will be notified in the same manner. Prospective offerors are advised that only Contracting Officers are legally authorized to commit the Government.</p>
<p>All offerors submitting white papers will be contacted by the technical POC, referenced in Section VII of this announcement. Offerors can email the technical POC for status of their white paper/proposal no earlier than 45 days after white paper/proposal submission.</p>
<p>2. ADMINISTRATIVE AND NATIONAL POLICY REQUIREMENTS:</p>
<p>Depending on the work to be performed, the offeror may require a Secret facility clearance and safeguarding capability; therefore, personnel identified for assignment to a classified effort must be cleared for access to Secret information at the time of award. In addition, the offeror may be required to have, or have access to, a certified and Government-approved facility to support work under this BAA. Data subject to export control constraints may be involved and only firms holding certification under the US/Canada Joint Certification Program (JCP) (www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp) are allowed access to such data.</p>
<p>3. REPORTING: Once a proposal has been selected for award, offerors will be required to submit their reporting requirement through one of our web-based, reporting systems known as JIFFY or TFIMS. Prior to award, the offeror will be notified which reporting system they are to use, and will be given complete instructions regarding its use.</p>
<p>VII. AGENCY CONTACTS:</p>
<p>Questions of a technical nature shall be directed to the cognizant technical point of contact, as specified below:</p>
<p>TPOC Name: Robert M. Flo <br />Telephone: (315) 330-2334<br />Email: Robert. Flo@rl.af.mil</p>

<p>In accordance with AFFARS 5301.91, an Ombudsman has been appointed to hear and facilitate the resolution of concerns from offerors, potential offerors, and others for this acquisition announcement. Before consulting with an ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations to the contracting officer for resolution.

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 6.302-1) with Mizuho Orthopedic Systems, Inc, 30031 Ahern Ave, Union City, CA 94587-1234 as the only responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Mizuhosi is the only responsible source that can provide a Hip & Knee Arthroplasty and Orthopedic Table System as required by USNS Comfort. 

 In compliance with the Command’s initiative to enhance Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) for Fleet Hospital Ship Program, the only technically acceptable item that has (ILS) support is the Hip & Knee Arthroplasty and Orthopedic Table System manufactured by Mizuho Orthopedic Systems Inc.  

Modular Table System made by Mizuho Orthopedic Systems Inc. has been standardized for all of the fleet hospitals.  The installed base is currently in more than half of the fleet hospitals as well as each new hospital that is being built.  These items were standardized to maintain interoperability between all of the fleet hospitals.  The choice of any other manufacturer would result in a breakdown of that interoperability between fleet hospitals and reduce the lifesaving capability of each of the fleet hospitals.  

Based on the above information, it has been determined that the only technically acceptable Hip & Knee Arthroplasty and Orthopedic Table System is manufactured by Mizuho Orthopedic Systems Inc.

Regulatory Requirements:  The system and all its components shall be compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements to market and deliver medical products for use in the United States of America; even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.  The claims made for the product shall comply with the regulations of the FDA with respect to products for marketing and delivery of a medical product for use in the United States of America, even should delivery be requested outside of the United States.

<DESC>The Bureau of Reclamation intends to issue a solicitation in June 2009 for plugging five sluice outlets within Arrowrock Dam.  The principal components of the work include removal and control of water; removing existing cast iron sluice outlet liners; designing, furnishing, and installing watertight bulkheads and frames for installation adjacent to existing sluice gates; furnishing and placing cast-in-place concrete for sluice outlet plugs; and pressure grouting and backfill grouting.
When the solicitation is completed and is ready to issue, the sluice gates will be under water.  We are conducting a site visit now so potential offerors can inspect the site conditions before the site is under water.  Onsite work will not begin until the fall of 2010.   WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO ATTEND THIS SITE VISIT IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN COMPETING FOR THE CONTRACT WHEN THE REQUIREMENT IS SOLICITED.   The site visit is scheduled for 10:00 a.m., February 17, 2009.   We will meet at Spring Shores Marina Boat Ramp (located approximately 18 miles northeast of Boise, Idaho, on State Highway 21 - take a right turn and travel approximately 1.1 miles east on Arrowrock Dam Road) and carpool to the dam as necessary to reduce congestion at the dam.  Site visit attendees need to have a current picture identification and evidence of company they are representing (i.e. business card).  Site visit attendees need to wear hard hats, boots, and appropriate clothing for wet conditions, and be prepared to climb several flights of stairs.  
The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 238110 and the size standard is $14 million.This solicitation will be issued pursuant to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program.  Estimated price range of the project is $500,000 - $1,000,000.
When the solicitation is issued, it will be a negotiated, best-value solicitation, that will consider at a minimum, the offeror's experience and past performance related to projects of similar difficulty.  Information pertaining to the solicitation for this project will be advertised in the future on Fedbizopps.gov.

If the offeror is not identified as an approved/qualified source in the item description, the offeror must submit traceability documentation to the Contracting Officer on or before the date that quotes/offers are due.  The documentation can be mailed, faxed or scanned and e-mailed.

The offeror must furnish a verifiable quotation from the approved/qualified source to the offeror.  The documentation must be on the approved/qualified source’s letterhead and include the approved/qualified source’s part number (or Mil Spec Type Designation), quantity sufficient to satisfy the solicitation requirement, date of quotation, and the offeror’s name and address.  
	
(2)  If offered item(s) are "shipped" or "in stock/currently owned by the offeror," the offeror must furnish one of the following documents: 
 
	(i)    A copy of the invoice; or  

            (ii)   A copy of the packing slip which accompanied shipment from approved/qualified source to offeror.

This Justification and Approval (J&A) is for procurement of Pro-Type Industries, Inc. equipment under a sole-source justification.  In order to avoid the high cost of purchasing complete HF base stations we are seeking to have a custom chassis produced to convert 150 HF mobile radios (currently in stock) into bases stations. The supplies and services requested are not available as COTS end items and are customized for RPB based on dimensions and design elements. Pro-Type Industries, Inc. provides design, prototyping, fabrication, and production services of custom products and has specific knowledge of the design elements RPB requires to manufacture the items sought.  Furthermore, because Pro-Type Industries, Inc. has already developed a prototype for RPB, it would be cost prohibitive to obtain production units from another vendor, as the process would need to be repeated and another prototype would need to be developed.  The Bureau of Information Resource Management (IRM), Radio Programs Branch (RPB) requires the procurement of this equipment from Pro-Type.  Limitation of competition under simplified acquisition procedures is permitted when justified by FAR 13.501 and 41 USCode 253(c)(1).  An extensive internet search was conducted to identify potential vendors.  Due to the custom nature of the products desired, it is essential that the vendor be able to provide rapid in-person response during the design and manufacturing phases.<BR><BR>

Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The project is critical to the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System and must be completed by June 1, 2011.  <BR><BR>This requirement is an essential component of the New Orleans Hurricane Protection System in Orleans Parish.  Reach LPV 111 is an earthen levee which is adjacent to the north side of the GIWW starting at the eastern terminus of the concrete I-Wall just east of Michoud Canal at approximate Sta. 1342+74 running east to Sta. 1105+50. From there, the levee section turns north and terminates at Sta. 1061+13 at the south wall of the CSX Railroad Gate, a total length of approximately 28,161 feet or 5.3 miles. Included therein is a T-Wall from approximate Sta. 1242+04 to Sta. 1235+51 with three 72 inch discharge pipes from Pump Station No. 15 that pass through the stem of this structure. New T-Walls were recently constructed at each end of the pump station. <BR><BR>The existing earthen levee sections are at El. 19.5 and were restored to this elevation following extensive degradation from Hurricane Katrina. This project involves raising the existing earthen levee to elevation varying from El. 28.0 to El. 31.5.  In order to accomplish the embankment construction while keeping the footprint of the levee within the existing right of way, the foundation will have to be strengthened by a Deep Soil Mixing (DSM) method. The Contractor will need to closely coordinate with the AE designer of both the levee section and the T-Wall section. The Contractor will also need to coordinate with the design and construction of improvements to the CSX Railroad gate on the Northeast end of the project and to any improvements that may be in progress at the west end of the project. LPV 111.02, and the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal floodwall.<BR><BR>Evaluation will be based on the Tradeoff Process (Best Value Continuum) in accordance with FAR SubPart 15.101-1 and Source Selection SubPart 15.3.  The evaluation criteria consists of four (4) Technical (non-cost) factors, each of which has additional sub-factors for evaluation and Price.  The Technical (non-cost) factors, listed in descending order of importance, are:  (1) Technical Experience; (2) Past Performance; (3) Preconstruction Services Plan; and (4) Construction Approach.  Technical (non-cost) factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.  The basis of award will be made to the Offeror who provides the best value to the Government. The resulting award will be a Firm Fixed Price base portion for the preconstruction services and Fixed Price Incentive Option the construction phase.<BR><BR>Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and minority institutions on the proposed contract are measured as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars. The selected firm, if a large business firm, must comply with FAR Subpart 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for submitting and negotiating a subcontracting plan.

The solicitation will be a Request for Proposal for a Firm Fixed-Price Base with Fixed Price Incentive option requirement in accordance with FAR SubPart 16.403 utilizing Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) also known as Construction Manager at Risk.  The project is critical to the Hurricane Storm Damage Risk Reduction System (HSDRRS) and must be completed by June 1, 2011.  <BR><BR>The levee system is an essential component of the New Orleans HSDRRS in St. Bernard Parish.

The existing levee elevation will be 20.0 upon completion of the LPV 148.01 construction contract, currently scheduled for March 2009.  This project will construct a new T-wall to elevation 29.0.  The walls will tie in to LPV 147 (Highway 46 and Bayou Road Floodgate) on the west at approximate station 1131+30, and LPV 149 (Verret to Caernarvon Floodwall and Structures) on the east at approximate station 1552+50.

The Technical (non-cost) factors, listed in descending order of importance, are:  (1) Technical Experience; (2) Past Performance; (3) Preconstruction Services Plan; and (4) Construction Approach.  Technical (non-cost) factors when combined are significantly more important than Price.  The basis of award will be made to the Offeror who provides the best value to the Government. The resulting contract award will be a Firm Fixed-Price portion for the preconstruction services and Fixed Price Incentive Option for the construction phase.<BR><BR>Extent of participation of small businesses (SB), small disadvantaged businesses (SDB), women-owned small businesses (WOSB), veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses,  and minority institutions on the proposed contract are measured as a percentage of the total planned subcontracting dollars.

<DESC>The U.S.Army Test & Evaluation Command intends to modify the existing 3CE FCS Modeling and Simulation Support (M &S) services contract currently provided by Trideum Corporation.  The services consists of M&S Support, test technology development (e.g., metrics), and coordination between the three Commands that constitute 3CE  ATEC, Research, Development, and Engineering Command (RDECOM), and Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC)  plus Program Manager FCS services under contract W9115U-08-C-0002.   The extended support includes additional FCS Programs such as Ground Soldier Ensemble (GSE), Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP), and Unmanned Aerial System (UAS).  Trideum will provide an approximate of 5,440 man hours to the ATEC TTD 3CE mission.  Trideum Corporation is  the only known source that has the expertise, technical resource, and the capability to meet the Threat Support within the required timeline with minimal impact since they are concurrently performing the work.   The FY09 Spin-out 1 test window  Technical Field Test (TFT), Train-up, FDT&E, and LUT  is anticipated to begin in May 2009, NLT 31 March 2009 (if not earlier)  and the Spin-out 1 M&S strategy for GSE must be finalized, therefore it is in the best interest of the Government to extend the ceiling of the Trideum contract.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 U.S.C. 253 (c) (1), implemented by FAR 6.302-1.  Interested organizations may submit their capability statements, and qualifications for the provision of this service, which may or may not be considered by the agency. This is not a solicitation, but a Notice of Intent. No solicitation will be issued for this sole source requirement, and no other information will be provided.  E-mail is the preferred method when receiving responses to this Notice and should be submitted to amsca.atec@us.army.mil .<BR><BR>

<CONTACT>Cynthia Ingrao, Clinical Analyst, Phone 619-532-8517, Email cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil
<DESC>A.	General Information

The Southwest Region will be standardizing Blood Collection Tubes.  This is a 5-year re-evaluation of this product group.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Region a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs’ needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. This product line includes blood collection tubes for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations for chemistry, hematology, coagulation and specialty studies and testing.  The entire category of Blood Collection Tubes has an annual demand of over $162,000.

The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program, Cardinal, currently serving Southwest Region.

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit’s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates for elimination (i.e. like product items), as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in the area include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP’s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is April 2009.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Southwest Region is seeking product line items in the category of Blood Collection Tubes. This product line includes blood collection tubes for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations for chemistry, hematology, coagulation and specialty studies and testing.  Within this region, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $162,000.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  

At the request of the Southwest Region Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

C.	Instructions to Vendors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, (3) your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than February 24, 2009.  Submissions must be received by 5:00 PM PST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Cindy Ingrao, RN, MSN 
Tri-Service Regional Business Office 
MSMMO - Southwest Region 
34800 Bob Wilson Drive, Suite 110 
San Diego, CA  92134 
Phone:  (619) 532-8517

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  All e-mail communication between vendors and the region will be digitally signed by the issuer.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	Evaluation Criteria

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process.
Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via e-mail communication with each vendor.  All communications of significant milestones, such as invitations to participate, notices of disqualification, etc. must be digitally signed.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria 
1.	Vendors must manufacture and/or distribute a complete line of blood collection tubes for adult, pediatric and neonatal populations for chemistry, hematology, coagulation and specialty studies.  The volumes of these tubes must include those less than 2.0 ml as well as greater than 2.0 ml for small volume testing.

Vendors should put their best foot forward, that is, provide a context to include any mitigating factors for these situations and any relief or resolution which may have been provided since there will be no further opportunity to explain these incidents.  If vendor has not had any of the above, so state.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process.
The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 14 calendar days to ship samples.  Samples with literature must arrive at the MTF by COB, 5PM local time, on the 14th calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.   The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree and 5 = Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the “break”, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria
1.	The tube is easily identified outside of its package.
a.	Technicians require the tube be easily identified outside of its package because tubes come in large volume packages and are stocked in each technicians caddy without the packaging.  They must be able to identify the tube outside of its packaging to be able to select the correct tube for the draw.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will be given tubes outside of their normal packaging and be able to identify the tube correctly using the information contained on the tube.

2.	The tube’s closure can be removed with fingers or an extractor.
a.	Technicians require the tube’s closure be removed with fingers or an extractor for withdrawal of the tube’s contents for analysis.  Withdrawing the contents with a needle puts the technician at risk for a needlestick injury and may damage the contents.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will be given an unused tube and will attempt removal of the closure with fingers and/or an extractor.

3.	The tube has a surface that can be written on with a ballpoint pen with patient identification information.
a.	Technicians require the tube have a surface that can be written on with a ballpoint pen with patient identification information.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will be given an unused tube and will attempt to write on the surface provided on the tube with a ballpoint pen.

4.	The tube is compatible with the cap piercing capabilities of current analyzers.
a.	Technicians require the tube be compatible with the cap piercing capabilities of their analyzers so the contents of the tube can be withdrawn and analyzed.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will be given tubes they can use with their analyzers and perform the skill set necessary to perform and visualize the cap being pierced by the analyzer.

5.	The expiration date is easily visible on the tube packaging and individual tube.
a.	Clinicians require the expiration date be easily visible on the tube package and individual tube to insure expired product is not used on patients.
b.	This criterion will be evaluated in the clinical setting at least (2) times.
c.	Evaluator will inspect the tube package and individual tube and verify the expiration date is clearly printed on it.

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  All vendors who provide samples with literature for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary. If a down-selection is made during the evaluation process, the Region may limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  The Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the evaluation results become more technically equal, price may become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  Failure to submit a discount off the DAPA price will result in exclusion.

The manufacture of these munitions includes all components and Load, Assemble and Pack (LAP). This survey is being performed to identify sources capable of supplying the entire quantity of 5 inch/54 Navy Gun Munitions as a Best Value, systems acquisition under an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract, over five (5) years from FY09 through FY13. <BR><BR>CHARGES: FY12 - 10K, FY13 - 12K, FY14 - 21K<BR>PROJECTILES: FY09 - 5K, FY10 - 18K, FY11 - 19K, FY12 - 20K, FY13 - 21K, FY14 - 17K<BR><BR>The 5 inch/54 ammunition manufacturing lead time is 23 months for charges and 31 months for projectiles.  This timeframe consists of first article testing, lot acceptance testing and commencement of delivery of the first years product.  All other years quantity will follow delivery of the first year. <BR><BR>Please complete this questionnaire within 30 days from the date of this publication. Feedback on this acquisition approach is also sought.<BR><BR>A respondent must have personnel trained, skilled, and experienced in handling Pressed & Melt Cast Explosive formulations, Propellants, and fuzes.  These materials are extremely hazardous and environmentally sensitive.  Strict US Government Security requirements are mandated for their storage and handling.<BR><BR>The Propelling Charges<BR>1) Propelling Charge (full) MK67 Mod 3<BR> The MK67 Mod 3 Universal Propelling Charge is used to fire various 5 (five) Inch projectiles. The maximum projectile range provided by the charge is approximately 13 nautical miles. The propelling charge employs propellant which provides an operating pressure of approximately 53,000 psi (365 Mpa) and a gun muzzle velocity of 2,650 feet per second. This propellant also provides a low flame temperature (less than 2,500k) which helps extend barrel life. The MK 67 propelling charge consists of a MK9 MOD1 cartridge Case with a MK45 MOD 1 Primer screwed into the base then loaded with approximately twenty-one (21) pounds of propellant. A cardboard wad and a polyethylene wad are then glued above the propellant and sealed with a MK12 MOD 3 Polyurethane Plug which is also glued in place and the case is crimped around it. The MK12  MOD 3 Poly Plug is a composite material with a Kevlar mesh sleeve designed to survive automated gun loading operations but still have the ability to disintegrate at function to avoid damage to exterior parts of Navy ships. A key component of the MK67 Mod 3 is the MK45 Mod 1 Electric Primer. The MK45 Mod 1 is a Navy unique primer. The MK45 Mod 1 uses an electrically initiated MK1 Mod 1 ignition element and 52 grams of class 4 black powder in a 20 inch perforated seamless steel tube. The MK 1 Ignition Element has an initiator consisting of a double-arm 0.002-inch-diameter platinum-iridium bridgewire embedded in a lead styphnate charge and a black powder booster.<BR><BR>2) Propelling Charge (reduced) MK68 	<BR>The MK68 is similar to the MK67 though it contains approximately 6.5 lbs. of propellant versus 21 lbs. for the MK67 full charge. The primer employed is a derivative of the MK45 but is shorter and has only 23 grams of Black Powder. The same MK12 Mod 3 Poly Plug, Wad and Cartridge Case are employed.<BR><BR>3) Clearing Charge MK65<BR>The Clearing Charge is Similar to the MK67 though it contains a shortened case of 10 length and only 10 lbs. of propellant. The primer employed is a derivative of the MK45 but is shorter and has only 39 grams of Black Powder. The same Wad and Cartridge Case are employed.<BR><BR>Note: 	MK14 Mod 3 Cartridge Tanks will be provided as Government Furnished Material. These tanks have been returned from the fleet and will need to be refurbished.  <BR><BR>High Explosive Projectiles <BR><BR>4) HE-MOF MK186<BR>The MK186 High Explosive - Multi Option Fuze (HE-MOF/MOFN) Round employs the MK437 Multi Option Fuze Navy (MOFN) on the MK64 High Explosive projectile body. This MOFN fuze uses inductive setting to provide accurate target engagement. The fuze is designed with four (4) modes of engagement, RF Proximity, Electronic Time in 10ms increments, Point Detonate, and Delay. The fuze uses PBXN-5 explosive as the booster. A mechanical Safe & Arm (S&A) serves to ensure proper safe separation.<BR><BR>The MK64 projectile body is designated as the High Explosive (HE) Projectile Body. The MK64 projectile body is a conventional AISI 1050 type grade steel body, this steel body is a single piece design. The explosive composition is either PBXN-106 or PBXN-9 depending on the specific All Up Round (AUR) Technical Data Package (TDP), ranging in weight from 8.6 - 9.2 pounds. A Boostered Fuze Adapter (BFA) is typically required in AUR configurations. The BFA is either PBXN-106 or PBXN-9 with approximate weight of 65 - 70 grams. A copper rotating band is used for spin and obturation. There is a 1/2 caliber boattail on the base of the projectile. The overall AUR length is approximately 26 inches, with a weight of 70 pounds<BR><BR>5) HE-ET MK179 <BR>The MK179 High Explosive - Electronic Time (HE-ET) Round employs the MK432 Electronic Time fuze on the MK82 Hi-Frag projectile body. This electronic time fuze uses inductive setting and precision timing of 0.01 seconds for accurate target engagement. The fuze is designed with a single (1) mode of engagement, Electronic Time. A Safe & Arm (S&A) serves to ensure proper safe separation through mechanical locks and an electronic arming delay. The S&A arms via initiation of a piston actuator 50ms prior to the set function time.<BR>	<BR>The MK82 projectile body is designated as the High Fragmentation (Hi-Frag) Projectile. These projectiles combine high lethality, extended range, and tighter dispersion in their design. The projectile consists of a two-piece projectile that is mechanical secured by a knurled interference fit at the center location. The projectile employs a nylon discarding rotating band at the boattail section. The nylon band has a unique micarta ring in the center area for obturation. The boattail is one full caliber. The main explosive charge is PBXN-106 (6.5) within a Polyethylene beaker, and there is also a PBXN-5 subcharge/booster. Both of these charges are encapsulated in a polyethylene beaker for insertion into the projectile body during joining of the two halves. The overall AUR length is approximately 26 inches, with a weight of 67.25 pounds.<BR><BR>Training Round <BR>6) Blind loaded and Plugged (BL-P) MK92<BR>The MK92 Blind Loaded and Plugged (BL-P) AUR is a MK64 projectile with inert filler material (sand & steel grit) and it is fitted with a dummy nose plug. This round is the US Navy Target practice/training round, and is completely inert. The ballistic flight characteristics are intended to match the MK64 based AUR configurations. Length is maintained at 26 inches, with a weight of 70 pounds.<BR><BR>Specialty Projectiles<BR>The Cargo Projectile body employs an exterior profile similar to the MK82 Hi-Frag projectile body. The projectile body is manufactured by forging from SAE 4140 Steel. A knurling is created on the boattail section of the projectile body to retain the nylon discarding rotating band. The nylon band has a unique micarta ring in the center area for obturation and projectile bore retention. The boattail is one full caliber. The weight of this individual projectile body component is approximately 36 pounds.<BR> <BR>7) Illumination MK176 Mod 0<BR>The MK176 Mod 0 Illuminating Projectile is a cargo projectile derivative. This cargo includes an illuminating flare candle, cruciform parachute, and a Ram Air Inflatable Decelerator (RAID). There is a 3.4 second pyrotechnic delay from fuze initiation to candle illumination. The cargo is expelled and allowed approximately 2.8 seconds to decelerate by the RAID prior to the RAID releasing to deploy the final parachute and initiate the illumination candle. This item uses the MK432 Electronic Time fuze. The overall AUR length is approximately 26 inches, with a weight of 68.3 pounds.<BR><BR>8) KE-ET MK182<BR>The MK182 Kinetic Energy - Electronic Time (KE-ET) is a cargo projectile derivative. This item is filled with inert 13-grain tungsten-nickel-iron alloy shot/pellets. There is approximately 17 pounds of the pellets which were vibratory loaded within a projectile. Aluminum spacers are employed to contain/capture the cargo within the projectile. The cargo is expelled through the rear of the projectile, by shearing the base plug threads.

<a href="mailto:wanda.d.king@us.army.mil">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity intends to award a contract on a non-competitive basis for the purchase and delivery of a Nikon microscope model number MEA53200 that has a DS-L2 camera control unit and accessories.  Nikon Instruments is the only company with a standalone camera control unit with high resolution LCD screen, which eliminates the necessity for the purchase and co-location of additional computer equipment and accommodates our limited space requirement for a BSL4 lab.<BR><BR>The suggested source is Nikon Instruments Inc., 514 Progress Drive, Suite T, Linthicum, MD  21090.   This equipment is required because it meets the space requirement and will be compatible with existing equipment already in use.  The Nikon microscope with accessories is interchangeable with the Nikon microscopes already in use in other containment suites and would save money on additional filter cubes.  The approximate amount of space available to accommodate this microscope is 750mm x 850mm x 650mm (height x width x depth). This microscope has been fitted with several objectives and filter cubes to allow maximum versatility (flasks, cover slips, and slides) and use (multiple fluorescence, phase, and Nemarsky microscopy).  The filter cubes (each costs about $5,000) and Nemarsk filters are also interchangeable with the other two Nikon microscopes already in use in our other containment suites and thus would save us money on the purchase of additional specialty filter cubes (which we already own and share between the other two microscopes) for the new microscope.  The microscope will be fitted with two cameras, one for low light detection and one for bright-field detection, to allow for the capture of digital images for archival and publication purposes.  <BR><BR>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR QUOTATION.  However, if qualified sources feel they can meet the technical requirements of this equipment they shall provide technical literature and pricing.  All inquiries and concerns must be emailed to wanda.king@amedd.army.mil.  Telephone requests or inquiries will not be accepted.  Responses to this electronic notice must be made by 12:00 PM on February 18, 2009.

The calibration and set-up data is held as proprietary by Wartsila North America.  The USCG Engineering Logistics Center does not possess the manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures, test specification or calibration set up data.  The Government intends to solicit only Wartsila North America and/or their authorized repair facilities.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Woodward engineering drawings, are available from one source only.  However other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to obtain technical data, manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures and test specifications along with the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves spare parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer; or 2) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e. salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics).  The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.

<DESC>Sources Sought:  The USCG Engineering Logistics Center anticipates awarding a requirements type contract for the inspection, repair, testing and calibration of Woodward Governors Diesel Engine:  NSN: 2990-01-329-8355  Part Number 8571-584
The calibration and set-up data is held as proprietary by Fairbanks Morse Engine.  The USCG Engineering Logistics Center does not possess the manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures, test specification or calibration set up data.  The Government intends to solicit only Fairbanks Morse Engine and/or their authorized repair facilities.  It is believed that this non-availability of technical data precludes the U.S. Coast Guard from obtaining competition, as the Woodward engineering drawings, are available from one source only.  However other potential sources can submit information concerning their capability to obtain technical data, manufacturing engineering drawings, test procedures and test specifications along with the parts for the purpose of the U.S. Coast Guard to determine whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The procurement involves spare parts being procured from the prime equipment manufacture or its actual supplier, and others proposing to manufacture the parts must either: 1) Data the offered parts have been satisfactorily manufacturer; or 2) Complete and current engineering data to demonstrate the acceptability of the offered parts (i.e. salient physical, functional and serviceability characteristics).  The submission of technical data package for review shall not impede the award of this requirements type contract, but will qualify the proposer for follow on acquisitions of the specific part numbers offered.  It is the Government belief that only Woodward Governor, the manufacture of the parts, or/or its dealers and distributors can furnish the required parts and ensure proper fit, form and function of all its components.  It is also the belief of the Government that only Fairbanks Morse Engine holds the proprietary calibration and set-up data.

<DESC><p>It is the intent of this agency to award a sole source contract under statutory authority 10 USC 2304(c)(1), set forth in Federal Acquisition Regulation 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. This agency intends to award to Siemens Government Services, Inc., 1881 Campus Commons Drive Suite 300, Reston, Virginia 20191 off of GSA Schedule #GS-35F-0696M.
<p>The 6th Air Mobility Wing/Command Post at MacDill AFB, FL requires additional hardware and software to pre-existing Siemens HiPath 4000 Communications System, to include installation. Siemens Government Services, Inc. is the sole manufacturer and supplier of authorized support for the HiPath 4000 Communications System. MacDill AFB requires the HiPath 4000 Communication System to keep its existing system operational and current to protect base assets. The HiPath 4000 Communication System will provide controllers with a seamless and intuitive visual interface to expedite communications during various contingencies as well as day to day operations. In order to maintain warranty and supportability for the existing HiPath 4000 Communication System, any additional equipment and labor must be provided by Siemens Government Services, Inc. No other sources can meet agency requirements due to proprietary equipment and software. To purchase comparable equipment from any source other than Siemens Government Services, Inc, would result in substantial duplication of cost to the government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>Market research was conducted for the purchase and installation of additional components to the pre-existing HiPath 4000 Communication System and Siemens Government Services, Inc. is the only contractor found able to supply this item as we require.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS. The intent of this notice is for information purposes only.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Chicago Operations Branch intends to solicit and negotiate a sole source firm fixed-price contract, 1 base year and 4 option years with McGraw Hill Construction Dodge 1200 G. Street. N.W., Suite 900, Washington, DC 20005. The procurement is for Real Estate Pipeline Data System and Reports, a database provides HUD's field economists with information on Multifamily and commercial properties under construction, in planning, and recently completed. The database provides detailed information on the number of units, costs, expected completion dates, developers, and use. The online feature of the database allows our field economists to search for projects at a variety of geographic levels including a certain mile radius around a particular project. These data are invaluable for completing Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis Reports, spotlight articles on individuals housing markets for the U.S. Housing Market Conditions reports, and project reviews for projects that have applied for FHA mortgage insurance. This is a unique database which is not done by anyone else to the government knowledge.

Under the authority of FAR 6.302-1 (Only One Responsible Source and no Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements), HUD intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source, however, the Government will consider all proposals received within 14 days after due date of publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete the proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<SOLNBR>W912DY09RAFCS
<ARCHDATE>05042009
<CONTACT>chaquandra, 256-895-1897

<a href="mailto:chaquandra.k.wilson@usace.army.mil">US Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville</a>
<DESC>The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntsville Engineering and Support Center (CEHNC), intends to increase the programmatic capacity of Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) Contract W912DY-07-D-0007. The  Army Facilities Component System (AFCS) is a military engineering and construction database system for engineers and military planners to use in construction of facilities and installations for military Theaters of Operations (TO).  The AFCS is composed of planning guidance, Computer Aided Draft Designs(CADD), Labor and Equipment Estimates (LEE), bill of materials (BOM), Theater Oriented Guide Specifications (TOGS) and logistics data within an automated data base that proscribes installations, austere facilities, and other contingency structures and works commonly required by military forces for base development, lines of communication, and tactical operations support. In 2004 CASA Designs was initially awarded a sole source three year ID/IQ contract valued at $4,750,000 in support of the AFCS system.<BR><BR>Contract W912DY-07-D-0007 was awarded in September of 2007 and consists of one (1) base year and up to four (4) one-year option periods. The awarded programmatic capacity was $9,400,000.00. This capacity was established prior to the award based on an analysis of the type of work required, anticipated workload, effects on competition, and historical AFCS contract/program data. Based upon future anticipated requirements, it is believed to be necessary that the Government modify contract W912DY-07-D-0007 to increase the programmatic ceiling by $10,000,000.00 which would result in a total programmatic ceiling of $19,400,000.000. The original basic contract Scope of Work for this contract will remain unchanged; the contract ordering period will also remain unchanged. <BR> As a result, the Government is currently performing market research to determine if there are other vendors, large or small, who are capable of performing the technical support, maintenance, and design requirements represented by this increased capacity. The basic requirement is to perform studies and develop austere contingency designs and support data.  AFCS designs are reviewed and updated to utilize unique state-of-the-art technology in construction designs, materials, and techniques within Army transformation to conserve resources. The AFCS database enables users to adapt required building materials to local customs.  The AFCS design library contains simple and standard temporary facility designs that require minimum engineer support to be assembled. These designs allow non-engineer troops or indigenous labor to perform the majority of the work which enables the engineer to oversee multiple projects simultaneously.  Services to be provided include, but are not limited to: (1) The development, conversion, and revision of drawings, bill of materials (BOM), Labor and Equipment Estimates (LEE) and construction process management estimates for a variety of facilities and installations in Army contingency operations; (2) Input of drawings, bill of materials (BOM), Labor and Equipment Estimates (LEE) and construction process management estimates into the AFCS32 database; (3) Revision and maintenance of Army Facilities Component System (AFCS) standards technical manual (TM); (4)  Analysis of Theater of Operations (TO) Army Construction and facility requirements and preparation of criteria and plans for updating AFCS, AFCS32 designs and TOGS to satisfy those requirements and (5) Preparation of AFCS and AFCS32 drawings using Computer-Aided Design techniques and provision of digitized drawing in AFCS and AFCS32 input format.   <BR><BR><BR>Unless a basis exists to procure the above increased capacity competitively, the Government intends to award the modifications to this  contract consistent with the terms identified within this announcement upon the basis of the authority provided in 10 U.S.C.2304(c)(1) and implemented by FAR 6.302-1(a)(2), only one responsible source and no other services will satisfy.  The Government will support the proposed non-competitive action by written justifications and obtain appropriate approval prior to proceeding.  Statements and/or written inquiries may be directed to Chaquandra Wilson, via e-mail at Chaquandra.k.wilson@usace.army.mil by 4:00 PM CST on 18 February 2009.  <BR><BR>Submissions should not exceed five (5) pages in length and shall address the following:<BR><BR>1. Name of your business, business address, and responsible point of contact (their phone number, and e-mail address).<BR> <BR>2. Type of business concern(i.e. small business, certified 8(a) small business, certified HUBZone business and/or Service Disabled Veteran Owned concern, etc according to NAICS code 541512 ( specify all  that apply). If applicable, please indicate that your firm  is a large business concern.<BR><BR>3. Experience in providing military contingency design and construction in support of military operations or involvement in such services.  Please provide customer references, locations, scope of effort, dollar value, and dates for efforts performed within the past five years.<BR><BR>4. Presence of a construction materials database that covers all of the Combatant Commanders Areas of Responsibility or the ability to develop one prior to proposal submission (tentatively anticipated on or before 16 March 2009). If so, please provide a brief description of your plan to create and implement a database of this sort.<BR><BR>5.

Response time of the contractor for emergency service calls made during normal working hours will be four hours after being officially notified. Emergency service calls made outside normal working hours will result in a response time of the contractor within four hours commencing the next available working day.  The term "Response time of the contractor" indicates the physical presence of a fully qualified field service engineer arriving on station within the specified time frame.  Official notification for the need of service will be considered given at the time a message is left with the mechanism the contractor has in place to inform their employees of the VA's needs. Response time will commence once the notification is given.Special Instructions: Instructional meeting: On the first visit to the site during the contract period, there will be a meeting of COTR, using service representative and contractor to discuss policies and expectations.

Consulting an ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines for any other processes (e.g., agency level bid protests, GAO bid protests, requests for debriefings, employee-employer actions, contests of OMB Circular A-76 competition performance decisions).</p>
<p>(c) If resolution cannot be made by the contracting officer, concerned parties may contact the USAF Academy Ombudsmen, Kelly Snyder<br />8110 Industrial Drive, Ste 103<br />USAFA, CO 80840<br />Telephone number 719-333-2074<br />FAX 719-333-9018<br />email: kelly.snyder@usafa.af.mil</p>
<p>Concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations that cannot be resolved at the MAJCOM/DRU level, may be brought by the concerned party for further consideration to the Air Force ombudsman, Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary (ADAS) (Contracting), SAF/AQC, 1060 Air Force Pentagon, Washington DC 20330-1060, phone number (703) 588-7004, facsimile number (703) 588-1067.</p>
<p>(d) The ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds the agency.</p>
<p>(e) Do not contact the ombudsman to request copies of the solicitation, verify offer due date, or clarify technical requirements. Such inquiries shall be directed to the Contracting Officer. <br />(End of clause)</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR 12.6, simplified acquisition procedures and the resultant purchase order will include all applicable provisions and clauses in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular 05-24.     

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation and a written solicitation will not be issued. This synopsis, NAICS code (541690) is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a Purchase Order in accordance with FAR Part 13.106 for the following statement of work, under the simplified acquisition procedures. This is a total 100% small business set-aside.  Prospective offerors are responsible for downloading the solicitation and any amendments.  It is the offeror's responsibility to monitor the FedBizOpps website for the release of any amendments to this solicitation. The Government reserves the right to award a contract without discussions if the Contracting Officer determines that discussions after initial offer(s) is/are provided are not necessary. 

This announcement is issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ).

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for expert consultant services to assist the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in meeting Paperwork Reduction Act compliance requirements.  This requirement identified as FDA-SOL-09-1052493, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 13 for the following statement of work:

STATEMENT OF WORK

Purpose   

The purpose of this project is to ensure that the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) complies with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).  The PRA requires that federal agencies estimate and justify the time and economic burden placed on those entities asked to supply information to the government and applies to CDRH documents that involve a collection of information by those outside the Federal government.  PRA is implicated in many CDRH documents, which may include guidance documents, regulations and letters to device manufacturers.  The PRA process is complex and involves numerous steps.  Steps include drafting and submission of an information collection request (ICR), which includes a Supporting Statement that addresses between 18 and 23 specific issues and a worksheet that certifies that the ICR complies with the PRA; drafting and publishing two Federal Register notices requesting public comment on the agency’s intent to collect the information, and working with the Office of Management and Budget to resolve any questions or concerns about the collection.  CDRH has developed a list of 2009 high priority guidance documents and regulations, and a general list of guidance documents to be revised, many of which may involve the collection of information.  The list of guidances that the agency is considering publishing in FY2009 can be found at 
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/agenda/fy09.html.  CDRH also frequently develops documents in response to emerging public health concerns that involve information collections.  Under the PRA, persons do not need to respond to a collection of information unless the collection displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number.  CDRH needs to ensure that it is able to expeditiously identify information collections in its documents and, if necessary, obtain approval from OMB. 

Background

CDRH issues numerous documents related to device and radiological product issues each year.  Many of these documents include recommendations or requirements related to the collection of information.  For example, CDRH may request reports and recordkeeping from device manufacturers; these generally constitute collections of information.  CDRH must ensure that its documents that include any information collection comply with the PRA.  

Complying with the PRA involves identifying and analyzing the extent of information collected in the document; researching whether existing paperwork approval covers the information collection; drafting/editing documents necessary to comply with the PRA which includes Federal Register notices and supporting documents submitted to OMB; determining whether emergency clearance for information collection is necessary and undertaking any steps necessary to obtain that emergency clearance from OMB; discussing and responding to questions from OMB and the public; and updating existing approvals to ensure they do not expire. 
 
To meet the demand for expert knowledge of the Paper Reduction Act the Agency relies on knowledgeable staff.  The Office and Staff’s in-house resources, though proficient, are often exceeded by the demand for this kind of expertise. The approval of this contract will greatly enhance the ability to address and respond to the often complex issues that arise with these compliance requirements; as establishing a professional services contract is a cost effective method, designed to allow us to provide the required expertise of an individual with the needed knowledge and skills. 

Scope of Work

A) Objective: 

To analyze CDRH documents that might implicate the PRA and determine whether any approval under the PRA is necessary.  In addition, if approval is necessary, the objective is to ensure that CDRH obtains that approval in a timely way by developing the necessary documents and working with the appropriate parties within CDRH, FDA, and OMB to obtain approval for the information collection.  

B) Scope of Work: 

Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the consultant shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work described below:

The consultant will analyze documents to determine what information is necessary to comply with PRA, including documents necessary to obtain new approvals and documents necessary to update existing approvals.   
	
The consultant may assist CDRH in developing training materials related to the PRA for CDRH staff.

The consultant will provide expertise to CDRH staff on the application of various statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders, on regulatory issues concerning medical devices and radiological health within the Paperwork Reduction Act, as well as the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Administrative Procedures Act as needed. 
	
The consultant will also provide assistance on other projects, such as drafting standard operating procedures for the CDRH Regulations Staff which includes identifying issues that need to be resolved before the process can proceed and who the decision making authority should be on those issues, as directed by the CDRH Center and/or Office Directors. 

Tasks:

The contractor shall attend all meetings (in person or by phone) as requested by the liaison, Director of Regulations Staff or CDRH Deputy Director.  The contractor may assist CDRH in the development of a PRA training and other PRA training materials.

Deliverables:

The contractor shall: 

1) Analyze documents identified as 2009 high priority guidance documents and regulations, as assigned, to determine if they implicate the PRA, and develop the documents required under the PRA (or requested by OMB) necessary to obtain approval.

If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance.

Information from FAR clause 52.232-25, Prompt Payment (FEB 2002), Paragraph (a)(5)(i):  For the sole purpose of computing an interest penalty that might be due the Contractor, Government acceptance is deemed to occur constructively on the 7th day (unless otherwise specified in this contract) after the Contractor delivers the supplies or performs the services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract, unless there is a disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with a contract provision.  If actual acceptance occurs within the constructive acceptance period, the Government will base the determination of an interest penalty on the actual date of acceptance.  The constructive acceptance requirement does not, however, compel Government officials to accept supplies or services, perform contract administration functions, or make payment prior to fulfilling their responsibilities.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

STATEMENT OF WORK
To efficiently relocate the Supply Department from building 603 Wing B to building 638. The movement of training equipment, gear, supplies, etc. must be accomplished so as
to not interrupt the training cycle at NSWC.

Project Date: April 2009/ Upon Completion of Building 638

Background 

The Supply Department has been limited in its capacity to support Naval Special Warfare Center and Basic Training Command’s training pipelines due to facilities and storage limitations.  In order to better serve the its customers, the Supply Department was temporarily relocated to building 603B in November 2007, while a new expanded and state of the art facility was being constructed in place of the old buildings.  The temporary location (building 603B) is approximately .5 mile from its future location at building 638. 

Purpose

After commencing research of similar moves, the most efficient way for this relocation is to hire an outside source.  This document discusses the methodology of the relocation.



OBJECTIVE
The Supply Department is requesting outside support for its relocation. The outside sources need to understand the sensitivity and associated accountability of the training equipment and gear. The project will be accomplished in Four (4) phases. Due to the nature and scope of inventory that will be moved, a walk through of the facilities with
the Supply Department will be arranged prior to the bidding process. 
The contractor must do a site visit prior to contract award. The final site-visit is Thursday February 5, 2009 @ 0900 AM PST.  Vendors interested in bidding are to arrange a walk through of the facilities with
Government POC: LTJG Jessica A. Dietz 
Phone: 619-537-1050  
Email: jessica.dietz@navsoc.socom.mil  

The project will be accomplished in four phases:

1.0 Building 603 – Main Warehouse:

Building 603 Wing B contains several storage areas, the largest of which is the main warehouse and occupies approximately 10,000 square feet of warehouse space.  This gear will be moved first and unpacked at the new location on the shelf and is not to remain on pallets.  Over 90% of the gear/equipment is boxed.  The material also includes approximately 350 PEPSE kits, which are contained in a “kit” form, and weigh approximately 25 pounds each.  The placement of all items at the point of destination will be determined prior to the move, and a diagram provided to the contractor.  *Boxes for the gear that is not already contained must be provided by the contractor.  In addition, contractor must provide all material handling equipment (MHE) capable of stowing items in constrained spaces.  The government WILL NOT provide any MHE such as a Bendi forklift, etc.  During this move an NSWC staff member will be present at all times.




2.0 Building 603 – SQT Warehouse:

The second storage area in Building 603 is the SQT (Seal Qualification Training) warehouse, which is approximately 814 square feet.  This area houses equipment and gear that is highly pilferable and requires extra care and attention.  All equipment will require packing, transportation, and unpacking in place at the new location – no items are to remain boxed or on pallet.  These storage devices/material must be moved and set up at the new location: 10 light blue vidmars (4'L X 2.5' X 5'H), 2 grey vidmars drawers, 36 grey shelves, 5 light blue vidmars (drawer), 2 light blue vidmar top extensions, 2 forty foot pallet racks.  The placement of all items at the point of destination will be determined prior to the move, and a diagram will be provided to the contractor. 

3.0 Building 603 – Ready Issue

  The ready-issue occupies approximately 750 square feet of warehouse space.  Approximately 50% of the training gear etc. is contained.  *Boxes for the gear that is not already contained must be provided by the contractor.  The training gear etc. is located in 12 foot racks.  It will require the gear on the shelves to boxed and put on pallets then transported to new location and shelved again.  The associated storage materials/devices of 8 vidmars, 1 blue bin (4'L X 2.5'D X 5'H), 2 fin shelves (6'L X 2'D X 7'H), and 6 instructor shelves may require movement to the new facilities.  The placement of all items at the point of destination will be determined prior to the move, and a diagram will be provided to the contractor.  

4.0 Building 603 – Office Spaces

This final phase will be focused on moving the office supplies, file cabinets, lockers and hardware.  There are also 5 network printers, and one copier.  The items must be moved from 3 different office areas to the new office locations (three) throughout building 638. 
 
Expected from the outside sources:

It is expected that the outside sources will provide the necessary equipment to move the gear, equipment, office supplies and furniture, etc from building 603 Wing B to building 638.  The contracted source of supply will also be required to provide the necessary equipment to put the training gear etc. on the 16 foot shelves at building 638.  This is to include material handling equipment such as Bendi forklifts, ladder/stairs, etc.  It is expected that any packing material (including but not limited to boxes, tape, pallets, and protective wrapping sheets) that is not provided by the Supply Department be incurred in totality by the outside source.  Waste generated as a result of the move will be hauled away by the outside source by the conclusion of the move and the outside sources must provide all necessary trucks and other equipment to implement the move on a date the Supply Department determines with the consultation of the contractor.  Commercial handheld two way radios will be allowed for use pending their check-in with the Communications Department.  Finally, the Contractor must ensure that all personnel have sufficient base access and obtain proper access for all associated trucks and equipment. The move is to be complete within two working weeks from the start date.  The move will be accomplished during normal working hours: 0730-1630 Monday through Friday.  The contractor must do a site-visit prior to contract award, and award will include evaluation of past performance equal to pricing.   To demonstrate knowledge and technical capability, offerors are required to submit proof of successful completion of 2 prior projects similar in scope with their bid. Final site-visit is Thursday February 5, 2009 @ 0900 AM PST

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) intends to award a purchase order for expert consultant services to assist the Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) in meeting Paperwork Reduction Act compliance requirements.  This requirement identified as FDA-SOL-09-1052493, is to notify contractors that the government intends to issue a purchase order in accordance with FAR Part 13 for the following statement of work:

STATEMENT OF WORK

Purpose   

The purpose of this project is to ensure that the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) complies with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520).  The PRA requires that federal agencies estimate and justify the time and economic burden placed on those entities asked to supply information to the government and applies to CDRH documents that involve a collection of information by those outside the Federal government.  PRA is implicated in many CDRH documents, which may include guidance documents, regulations and letters to device manufacturers.  The PRA process is complex and involves numerous steps.  Steps include drafting and submission of an information collection request (ICR), which includes a Supporting Statement that addresses between 18 and 23 specific issues and a worksheet that certifies that the ICR complies with the PRA; drafting and publishing two Federal Register notices requesting public comment on the agency’s intent to collect the information, and working with the Office of Management and Budget to resolve any questions or concerns about the collection.  CDRH has developed a list of 2009 high priority guidance documents and regulations, and a general list of guidance documents to be revised, many of which may involve the collection of information.  The list of guidances that the agency is considering publishing in FY2009 can be found at 
http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/mdufma/guidance/agenda/fy09.html.  CDRH also frequently develops documents in response to emerging public health concerns that involve information collections.  Under the PRA, persons do not need to respond to a collection of information unless the collection displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number.  CDRH needs to ensure that it is able to expeditiously identify information collections in its documents and, if necessary, obtain approval from OMB. 

Background

CDRH issues numerous documents related to device and radiological product issues each year.  Many of these documents include recommendations or requirements related to the collection of information.  For example, CDRH may request reports and recordkeeping from device manufacturers; these generally constitute collections of information.  CDRH must ensure that its documents that include any information collection comply with the PRA.  

Complying with the PRA involves identifying and analyzing the extent of information collected in the document; researching whether existing paperwork approval covers the information collection; drafting/editing documents necessary to comply with the PRA which includes Federal Register notices and supporting documents submitted to OMB; determining whether emergency clearance for information collection is necessary and undertaking any steps necessary to obtain that emergency clearance from OMB; discussing and responding to questions from OMB and the public; and updating existing approvals to ensure they do not expire. 
 
To meet the demand for expert knowledge of the Paper Reduction Act the Agency relies on knowledgeable staff.  The Office and Staff’s in-house resources, though proficient, are often exceeded by the demand for this kind of expertise. The approval of this contract will greatly enhance the ability to address and respond to the often complex issues that arise with these compliance requirements; as establishing a professional services contract is a cost effective method, designed to allow us to provide the required expertise of an individual with the needed knowledge and skills. 

Scope of Work

A) Objective: 

To analyze CDRH documents that might implicate the PRA and determine whether any approval under the PRA is necessary.  In addition, if approval is necessary, the objective is to ensure that CDRH obtains that approval in a timely way by developing the necessary documents and working with the appropriate parties within CDRH, FDA, and OMB to obtain approval for the information collection.  

B) Scope of Work: 

Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the consultant shall furnish the necessary personnel, material, services, facilities, and otherwise do all things necessary for or incident to the performance of the work described below: 
 
The consultant will work with CDRH in identifying documents that involve information collection.   
	
The consultant will analyze documents to determine what information is necessary to comply with PRA, including documents necessary to obtain new approvals and documents necessary to update existing approvals.   
	
The consultant may assist CDRH in developing training materials related to the PRA for CDRH staff.

The consultant will provide expertise to CDRH staff on the application of various statutes, regulations, and Executive Orders, on regulatory issues concerning medical devices and radiological health within the Paperwork Reduction Act, as well as the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Administrative Procedures Act as needed. 
	
The consultant will also provide assistance on other projects, such as drafting standard operating procedures for the CDRH Regulations Staff which includes identifying issues that need to be resolved before the process can proceed and who the decision making authority should be on those issues, as directed by the CDRH Center and/or Office Directors. 

Tasks:

The contractor shall attend all meetings (in person or by phone) as requested by the liaison, Director of Regulations Staff or CDRH Deputy Director.  The contractor may assist CDRH in the development of a PRA training and other PRA training materials. The contractor shall assist with the development of Regulations Staff standard operating procedures. The contractor shall provide additional counsel or services related to PRA as directed by the liaison, Regulations Staff Director or CDRH Deputy Director. The contractor will be required to commit to scheduled and ad hoc telephone interaction with Regulations and/or Senior Office Staff.  The contractor will participate telephonically at meetings, and conferences as necessary, as a representative of FDA. 

Deliverables:

The contractor shall: 

1) Analyze documents identified as 2009 high priority guidance documents and regulations, as assigned, to determine if they implicate the PRA, and develop the documents required under the PRA (or requested by OMB) necessary to obtain approval.  Initial comments are due within 2 weeks of assignment, final comment within 1 week of receiving comments and concurrence from the Regulations Staff Director.  Deadlines for preparation of approval documents, where determined necessary, will be determined as assignments are made and based on the individual complexity and implications identified.  

2) Assist in development of training materials related to PRA.   Initial comments are due within 2 weeks of assignment, final comment within 1 week of receiving comments and concurrence from the Regulations Staff Director.  Deadlines for preparation of training documents will be determined as assignments are made.

All documents and records (including photographs) generated during the performance of work under this contract shall be for the sole use and become the exclusive property of the U.S Government.

Offerors should verify in writing which items are listed on their GSA schedule contracts and which items are "open market" items. For an offer to qualify as an offer based on a GSA schedule contract, the value of "open market" items included in the offer may not exceed the applicable micro-purchase threshold as defined in FAR 2.101.<BR><BR>41 USCode 253 (c) (1) and FAR 6.302-1 are cited as the statutory authority.  As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the most cost effective means to meet the ENM support requirement.  The requirement will be competed as the IT community responds to price requests on Fedbid.  All bids will be provided from GSA approved vendors.  It is anticipated the final award will be to the entity providing the best competitive price through the Fedbid process.  As this is a brand name justification it is supporting existing HP equipment that has reached end of life or out-of-cycle SAN that will be moved to the LAB which has no SAN.  Current SAN is 4 years old, is not expandable and has become stretched for capacity.<BR><BR>to correct Line Item 9<BR><BR>to correct Line Item 11 - p/n<BR><BR>

<DESC><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Cancer Institute (NCI), Center for Cancer Research (CCR), intends to procure on a sole-source basis for a  Ra-224 Isotope Generator with additional processing to remove stable Pb with AlphaMed Inc., P.O. Box 607 Acton, MA 01720. 
This acquisition will be processed in accordance with simplified acquisition procedures as stated in FAR Part 13.106-(b)(1). The North American Industry Classification System Code is 325413 and the business size standard is 500 employees. 
Ra-224 generators are required for on-site production of the daughter radionuclide from the decay process, Pb-212, that the Radiation Oncology Branch (ROB) has been using to perform extensive pre-clinical studies, a disseminated colorectal disease animal model system.  Ra-224 will be purchased in a generator form for use in ROB&rsquo;s dedicated Hot Cell laboratory.  The Ra-224  generator would be used for direct support of the toxicology and additional studies requisite for the IND for the clinical trial.  
The Ra-224 generator must be consistent with those previously prepared for and used by the Chemistry Section for their animal model pre-clinical therapy studies and originate from the same nuclear feedstock materials; therefore, insuring completely consistent chemical and radiochemical behavior and purity of the eluted Pb-212.  Activity levels of 15-20 mCi is a minimal amount of Ra-224 that has to be on the generators such that adequate amounts of Pb-212 can be provided.  
Alphamed has the exclusive contract from the Department of Energy (DOE) for marketing this radionuclide due to the parental being fissionable and not available from any commercial source in this country.  ROB uses the parental radionuclide, Pb-212, in it&rsquo;s studies.  There are no other known sources which sell ready to use generators at greater than 2 mCi of Ra-224.
The process to remove stable Pb is critical to good operational generators for doing the animal model pre-clinical therapy studies.  The presence of stable Pb interferes and competes with the use of the radioactive Pb-212 that is generated from the Ra-224.  The Ra-224 generator and the translation process both reside with AlphaMed; therefore, AlphaMed is uniquely qualified to  provide the requirement with no disruption or delay to the on-going studies.
This is not a solicitation for competitive quotations.  However, if any interested party believes it can meet the above requirement, they may submit a statement of capabilities.   All information furnished shall be in writing and must contain sufficient detail to allow the NCI to determine if it can meet the above unique specifications described herein.  An original and one copy of the capability statement must be received in the NCI contracting office on or before 11:00 AM EST on February 16, 2009.  All questions must be in writing and can be faxed to (301) 402-4513 or emailed to Melissa Marino, Contract Specialist at marinome@mail.nih.gov.  It is the vendor&rsquo;s responsibility to call (301) 402-4509 to verify questions have been received.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  In order to receive an award, contractors must have valid registration/certification in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov and the Online Representations and Certifications Applications (ORCA), http://orca.bpn.gov.  No collect calls will be accepted.    Please reference NCI-90046-MM on all correspondence.</p>

COORDINATION 
The proposed work may extend over several fiscal years, involving projects at various stages, which will require that the selected firm(s) must be capable of providing and managing a multi-disciplinary team from within the firm or in conjunction with subconsultants. The A/E will need to have direct contact with Federal, State or local regulatory agencies to assure compliance with regulations, codes and policies. 
SPECIALIZED SERVICES 
In the course of doing business with Architect/Engineering firms under contract with the Denver Service Center, the DSC occasionally needs to obtain specialized services from subconsultants under the prime contract. In these instances, the majority of the work may be performed solely by the subconsultant with little involvement of the prime contractor. Even though the work is performed primarily by the subconsultant, DSC will ensure that the prime contractor is involved in all discussions and all correspondence is routed through the prime contractor. All task orders will be issued to the prime contractor. Prime contractors have indicated their concerns with the ceiling amounts and the effect these "pass-throughs" would have on the cap. This has been taken into consideration in establishing the maximum contract amount for this solicitation and the resultant contract(s). Prime contractors submitting statements of qualifications are advised that the Denver Service Center will continue to acquire such specialized services. The DSC does not allow the prime consultant an administrative handling or coordination fee on sub-consultant's services.
REQUIRED DISCIPLINES
Required disciplines include, but are not limited to, professionals registered as architects, engineers and landscape architects, and professionals meeting the Secretary of the Interior's Professional Qualification Standards (as appropriate) for Geotechnical and Hydrological Engineers, Hydrologists, Geologists, Biologists, Ecologists, Wetland Specialists, Economists, Engineers, Risk Assessors, Project Managers, Landscape Architects, Civil Engineers, Structural Engineers and Planners, Cost Estimators, and other related disciplines.
CONTRACT PERIOD 
All services will be provided under an Indefinite Quantity contract. The base contract period will be for one year with options to extend for four additional one-year periods. Work will be ordered by issuance of firm fixed price or not-to-exceed type task orders. The maximum ordering limitation will be $8,000,000.00 for the life of the contract. The $8,000,000.00 maximum may be realized in a single year or spread out over the life of the contract including all option years. The guaranteed minimum for the life of the contract, which includes the base period and all options exercised, is $25,000.00. 
SUSTAINABLE DESIGN 
The U.S. Government has adopted sustainable design as the guiding principle for its planning, design and construction projects. By definition, this means meeting present needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In practice, sustainable design utilizes best available solutions within the design tradition and conserves global resources, utilizes energy efficiently, recycles materials and waste, and specifies ecologically responsible methods, practices, and materials in the construction and operations of Government facilities. Accordingly, the selected firm(s) must exhibit current credentials and demonstrated competency in sustainable design certifications and memberships in professionally recognized organizations that promulgate sustainable practices. Firms shall validate their sustainable abilities and practices through completed LEED certified construction projects and green building awards.

Please cc: Ms. Tara Currie at Tara.currie.ctr@navy.mil when emailing.  An email confirmation will be sent upon receipt and a CD-ROM will be mailed upon verification of requestor’s information.  

Radio Frequency Allocation (RFA) Request
The RFA Request has been updated to pre-fill a portion of the requested information to facilitate offeror completion.  This update has been coordinated with the Range Safety Office; offerors who have already submitted Requests do not need to resubmit. The updated RFA Request is available via this amendment and can also be found on the PMA-263 website at http://www.navair.navy.mil/pma263/.  

The intent of the RFA request is for the offerors to submit a request for all frequencies that are required to operate their system.  These frequencies may include, but are not limited to, primary and secondary air vehicle command and control, video transmission, and any other external RF emitters (e.g. handheld radios, wireless head sets).  Offerors may refer to the May 2008 Draft System Specification which was provided via CD for STUAS/Tier II frequency parameters.

Marking Instructions
Offerors shall not submit Source Selection Information as part of the range safety clearance process and, accordingly, no documents shall be marked with Source Selection or Contractor Bid and Proposal markings.  See FAR 2.101 and 3.104.  It is acceptable to mark offeror proprietary information.
 
Competition Timeline Information
While the Government intends to conduct the flight demonstration phase on the Naval Air Warfare Center (Weapons Division) (NAWCWD) China Lake range, the Government reserves the right to change the location of the flight demonstration venue as required in order to accommodate changes in source selection planning and/or range availability due to department prioritization.

Proposals will be due 45 days after release of the final RFP.

Offerors are invited to comment and/or question the information provided in this announcement, however, the Government may not be able to respond to such submissions.  Such submissions should be directed to the point of contact cited below.

This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government.  The Government will not assume liability for costs incurred for review of the provided information or for any costs associated with offerors participation in this procurement; therefore, offeror cost in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.
