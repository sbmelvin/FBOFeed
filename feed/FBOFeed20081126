<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD), through the Dahlgren Laboratory at Dahlgren, VA soliciting scientific and engineering research "white papers" to identify capabilities of University and Non-Profit Institutions to conduct basic research, applied research, and advanced research projects in a wide variety of scientific and engineering disciplines.
PLEASE NOTE: We are NOT seeking specific research proposals at this time - we are requesting submission of capability statements only.  Specific research proposals may be returned to the submitting institution with a request to submit a capability statement.  N00178-08-Q-3004 white papers will be considered as candidate sources until 30 Sept 2010.  N00178-07-Q-3003 white papers will be considered as candidate sources until 30 Sept 2009.  White papers submitted under BAA N00178-06-Q-3009 are no longer being considered.
Research projects are expected to require a high level of technical expertise, primarily involving PhD level personnel; personnel requirements include, but are not limited to, the following categories: distinguished postdoctoral, senior postdoctoral, postdoctoral, professors, and graduate students.  Awards under this BAA are expected to take the form of grants, cooperative agreements, other transactions, or contracts.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541712 -- Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences.  Representative research areas requiring scientific and engineering research expertise for which "white papers" (capability statements) are solicited include:
FY09 BAA Announcement Topics 
Topic (a): COMPLEX SYSTEMS/EMERGENT BEHAVIOR MODELING 
Emergent Behavior Systems (EBS) are those systems characterized by complex system phenomena in which characteristics that are observed at a global level arise from interactions among lower-level components acting on rules that are executed using only local information and without reference to global information.  Such phenomena is recognized as predominant in many natural systems and research indicates that the complex interactions between simple entities is central to many of the more sophisticated behaviors we observe in weather phenomena, social insects, terrorist networks, economics, etc.  Models of EBS are typically implemented through agent-based simulation (ABS).  Although modeling EBS through ABS has the potential to provide a disciplined methodology to explore both the composition and performance of EBS, at present specific application domains instead of more general theories of emergence have dominated what little there is in the way of axiomatic formalisms and ass! ociated theoretical foundations to describe such systems.  Modeling EBS and designing for emergence is less understood compared to traditional engineering domains since the goal is not merely to create an environment in which well specified agents can interact and then "see what happens" but rather given a desired system behavior (or set of behaviors) how should entities be designed and in what number to effect the desired system behavior?  This is compounded by the fact that the decision space of such systems is typically computationally intractable.  Additionally, many real-world examples tend to be singular in nature (e.g., the formation of adversarial organizations, group responses to catastrophic events, and most military operations) and so do not occur with sufficient frequency to allow the formulation of probability distributions.  Although increasing computational power is making the creation of such systems through agent-based methods more attractive, validating su! ch designs remains challenging, costly, and problematic.  Nevertheless, the future of unmanned autonomous systems, swarm systems, warfare analysis, social network analysis (e.g., terrorist networks), and artificial intelligence will rely on increased understanding of emergent phenomena.
Topic (b):  HYPERGOLIC PROPELLANT SAFETY 
The Navy has to date restricted the use of hypergolic fueled weapons aboard ships due to the unique environment and safety concerns for propellant leaks, both from a toxicity and reactivity standpoint.  Further study of these concerns will be required before the acceptability of hypergolic fueled weapons is considered by the Navy.  Limited studies have been performed in the past.  Requested studies are of Navy deployed weapon configurations and environments and to focus on such areas as:  (1) safer fuel alternatives with pros and cons, (2) ideal fuel tank/container construction, (3) leak containment and mitigation, (4) leak detection technology (sensors with consideration for size, power requirements, maintenance, and accessibility) and (5) leak reaction response approaches.
Topic (c):  RISK ASSESSMENT 
Perform analysis to transition current and emerging risk assessment methodologies and techniques beyond single system and into the systems of systems context.  Research should include concepts that allow risk definition at any level of system context when integrating multiple systems into a system of systems environment.  Research should consider statistical research work performed in the areas of intuitive and subjective probability, to include conditional probabilities such as experience and knowledge; analysis, research, and technical support to define quantitative and qualitative safety risk definition (i.e. personnel injury, equipment damage, and environmental damage) associated with the integration and interoperability of naval weapon systems within the system of system context.   
Topic (d):  ADVANCED PAYLOADS AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS FOR UNMANNED VEHICLES 
Research the application and integration of advanced sensor packages and autonomous decision making payloads onto unmanned vehicles including Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs). This research is to develop and demonstrate integrated payloads that increase the military utility of unmanned vehicles while reducing personnel requirements to operate and field these vehicles.
Topic (e):  ELECTROMAGNETIC RAILGUN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT 
The US Navy is pursuing the development of an electromagnetic launcher (also known as a railgun) for long range naval surface fire support.  An electromagnetic launcher consists of two parallel electrical conductors called rails, and a moving element, called the armature. Current is passed down one rail, through the armature, and back up the other rail.  The interaction between the magnetic field and the current causes the armature to accelerate.  This will create high temperature and strong forces in the breech, rails and armatures.  In order to develop the Electromagnetic Railgun Launcher, we are working on developing model and simulation tools, and instrumentation that can survive the extreme environment.  These tools will help us understand the multiphysics phenomena (dynamics, thermal, electromagnetic, armature to rail interface, etc.) of the launcher and therefore develop a successful system.
Topic (f):  EXPEDITIONARY CONCEPTS AND OPERATIONS 
Develop new technologies in support of Expeditionary Concepts and operations that will be evaluated relative to the projected operational requirements of future maneuver warfare and develop a technology investment strategy in the form of a technology roadmap.  Specific tasks will include, but not be limited to: 
1. Develop exploratory models to be designed, built and evaluated in conjunction with other appropriate advanced models. 
2. Development of new or modification of existing technologies that will contribute to long-range detection and tracking of targets.  
3. Increase target location accuracy of targeting systems over existing and planned target acquisition systems 
4. Expand performance envelope to include urban environments and operations from vehicles 
5. Reduction of system size and weight 
6. Long-range acoustic detection of targets 7. Hardware in the loop modeling and simulation 
8. Sensor clustering 9. Human Systems Integration and Performance 
10. Laser Systems Analysis 
Topic (g):  PULSED AND HIGH POWER ELECTROMAGNETIC TECHNOLOGIES 
Technologies including electrical energy storage, pulsed power switching, electromagnetic launcher components, compact high-voltage sources, ultra-wideband technology, high power microwave technologies, detectors and sensors, and all associated modeling; and thermally induced material failure mechanisms.  Analysis of high heating rate linear and non-linear processes.  Additionally, hypersonic technologies to include materials, electronics, test and evaluation assets, and associated modeling and simulation.
Topic (h):  Investigate using a small microwave system to initiate secondary energetic materials from an artillery fuze.

Topic (i):  Investigate using a spread spectrum RF system for use in an artillery proximity fuze.

Topic (j):  Text Data Mining and Network Analysis for the Mitigation of Technology Surprise This effort seeks to develop new methodologies that utilized semi-formatted/unformatted data feeds along with network based information in order to mitigate technology surprise. We are specifically interested in new techniques that combined together text data mining approaches/features and network analysis based approaches/features. In addition we are interested in using these combined techniques to improved data visualization, dimensionality reduction, clustering, or classification results.

Topic (k):  Inhalational Anthrax and other Diseases in Animals: 
NSWCDD is interested in analyzing and quantifying host-pathogen interactions in animal models of anthrax.  For example, NSWCDD is interested in determining bacterial numbers, germination rates, toxin production, and antibody production in selected tissues and biological fluids of immunized and non-immunized animals following exposure to high and low doses of virulent B. anthracis spores.   The targeted exposure route is via inhalation (aerosol, intratracheal, intranasal).  Targeted tissue/fluids include BAL, blood, lung homogenates, lymph nodes and other tissues relevant to the infection.  Targeted hosts include rabbits and non human primates as well as other relevant species.  In addition, NSWCDD is also interested in conducting similar studies using other bacterial agents as well as viral agents.  Targeted tissues, sample types and analysis will depend on the agent with the goal of quantifying the disease progression following exposure to high and low doses.
Topic (l):  Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) Analysis of Biotoxin Samples 
Perform analysis and quantification of biotoxin samples, specifically aflatoxin, pre- and post-decontamination, using LC-MS and/or Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS-MS).  In particular, analysis would include identification, quantification of aflatoxin and identification and quantification of decontamination by-products for aflatoxin.Topic (m): Next Generation of Technologists Provide support for developing and maintaining a cadre of active research scientists who can distill and extend results from worldwide research and apply them to Naval problems, to promote hiring and development of new scientists, and to encourage collaboration with universities, private industry, and other Navy and Department of Navy laboratories, in particular the corporate Naval Research Laboratory (NRL).  Establish a long-term program to create the next generation of Technologists at Naval R&D centers;  generate and sustain the interest and excitement of adolescents in careers in mathematics, physics, engineering and or other sciences, invigorate the science and math curricula, and enhance science and math training for teachers. Topic (n):  Development of new technologies in detection, protection, filtration, decontamination, and predictive hazard modeling of chemical warfare agents, toxic industrial chemicals and materials, biological warfare agents, and radiological materials.  
Topic (o):  Experimentation to understand phenomenology of chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear aerosol, droplet or vapor interaction with complex environmental surfaces.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516       The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Research and Development, National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Sustainable Chemistry Research Program, located in Cincinnati, Ohio intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority ofFAR 6.302-1, with Mettler-Toledo AutoChem, Inc. for the following:
1.	One (1) ReactIR 45m Reaction Analysis Module (Real-time Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer).2.	One (1) AgX DiComp Fiber Conduit.3.	One (1) 2-Channel AgX Fiber Multiplexer.4.	One (1) Laptop Computer, Notebook, WIN XP.5.	One (1) iC Quant quantitative Analysis Module.6.	One (1) React R/iC10 Hardware.7.	Installation.
   The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capabilities to provide the aforementioned items.   The Mettler-Toledo AutoChem, Inc. (FTIR) Spectrometer is mobile version of a previously purchased Mettler-Toledo FTIR; as a result the Mettler-Toledo AutoChem, Inc. Real-time FTIR Spectrometer is able to utilize the existing nitrogen purge system which was purchased to meet the specifications of EPA's existing Mettler-Toledo system.    The Mettler-Toledo AutoChem, Inc. Real-time FTIR Spectrometer has the capability to be connected directly to EPA's existing reactor configuration. The Mettler-Toledo AutoChem, Inc. Real-time FTIR Spectrometer is capable of using sensors with EPA's existing stationary FTIR system, thus expanding EPA's current capabilities. The current Real-time FTIR Spectrometer uses a proprietary software package (Mettler-Toledo FTIR Software System Mettler-Toledo IC IR Version 4.0), purchased as a part of the previous requirement. The new Mettler-Toledo AutoChem, Inc. Real-time FTIR Spectrometer uses the same software and allows researchers to perform identical reactions in both systems allowing forwards and backwards transfer of data.
   EPA has identified Mettler-Toledo AutoChem, Inc. as the only provider of commercial equipment able to meet the requirements of this procurement. Subsequently EPA has determined that Mettler-Toledo AutoChem, Inc. is the only manufacturer that can provide the items that can meet the requirement listed above. The estimated value of the Real-time Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometer is $167,000.00.
   This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.

<DESC>The Executive Officer plays a pivotal role in assuring the Mission’s management systems and program support operations are established and operating optimally.  The incumbent ensures that services are delivered promptly and with excellent customer service.  Principal responsibilities include supervision of personnel, procurement, information technology, budget and finance, customs and shipping, communications and records, safety and security, travel and training, property and leasing, motor pool and maintenance, and minimal ICASS coverage through the Embassy.  It is important to note that USAID Timor Leste is a Tier 3 post with no current plan for consolidation.  Almost all services are separate with very little ICASS support, although Embassy relations are very good at post.	

The incumbent leads the initiative to design and/or modify support systems that improve program performance.  Staff that have requisite skills, tools and resources perform more effectively and efficiently.  Such improvements in the past have included team building activities, office landscaping and modernization, information technology advancements, organization and staffing development, and increasing levels of customer service.  The incumbent’s regular contact with the U.S. Embassy Management Office and Security Office ensure that USAID staff understand and are current on the latest Post policies and instructions.  The EXO is the Mission’s principal point of contact with USAID’s Human Resources Office (M/HR), the Overseas Management Services Office (M/OMS), the Office of Security (SEC), the Office of Information Resources Management (IRM), the Office of Acquisitions and Assistance (M/OAA, for simplified acquisitions), the Office of Travel and Transportation (M/TT), and with the Regional Development Mission – Asia (RDMA/Bangkok) for Finance and Accounting (RDMA/OFM), the Regional Office of Procurement (ROP), the Regional Legal Advisor (RLA), and the Regional Executive Office - Information Technology team(EXO/IT) and Human Resource team (EXO/HR).

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<a href="mailto:rachael.raposa@usace.army.mil">US Army Engineer District, New England</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-New England District (Corps) is proposing to restore Broad Meadows Marsh, located south of Sea Street and the Broad Meadows School in Quincy, Massachusetts.  The Project involves the removal of approximately 40 of 65 acres of historic fill resulting from the disposal of dredged material within a diked area to restore 35 acres of salt marsh and 5.0 acres of Bordering Vegetated Wetland (BVW).  The remaining 25 acres of fill will be converted to coastal grassland habitat that will also provide passive public recreational uses.  The project is part of a joint effort between the City (the local sponsor for the Project) and the Corps to restore the Broad Meadows Marsh.  The Corps is the lead agency and will be responsible for the construction and construction management of the restored salt marsh and waterfront park.  The proposed construction activities will involve excavation of approximately 6 to 10 feet of former hydraulically dredged material (approximately 390,000 cubic yards) from the southern portion of the former dredge disposal site to achieve a sustainable salt marsh elevation between elevation 1.5 feet and 5 feet NAVD 88.  Elevated walkways will be constructed across portions of the salt marsh and will be connected to a trail network throughout the site.  The southern, excavated area will be graded to elevations to sustain approximately 10 acres of low salt marsh, 0.3 acres of salt pannes, and 20 acres of high salt marsh.  Two main tidal channels will be constructed through the marsh to provide tidal flushing to sustain a salt marsh ecosystem and provide roughly 6 acres of aquatic intertidal habitat.  The constructed channels will be aligned with the former intertidal creeks that existed before the site was filled with dredged materials.  The construction contractor will utilize low pressure heavy construction equipment suitable for salt marsh restoration work to relocate the formerly dredged material on site.  To protect water quality, the existing perimeter berm will be left in place until all of the material behind it is removed. Equipment will be located only in those areas which will need to be disturbed in order to remove portions of the berm for the main channel and to connect the restored channel to the existing channel outside the berm.  If equipment needs to go beyond the area that will be disturbed, then appropriate matting (e.g., timber mats or swamp mats) will be used for any equipment that will be staged on the existing salt marsh. As a layer of natural peat may exist under the diked area to be restored, and a natural seed source exists immediately adjacent to the restored site, the area should re-colonize with native salt marsh communities.  However, to facilitate the colonization of the salt marsh with native vegetation, the new high and low marsh areas will be planted with Spartina patens and Spartina alterniflora, respectively. The estimated cost of this work is between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000. This solicitation is 100% Set-Aside for HUBZone Small Business concerns. The NAICS code for the work is 237990 with a small business size standard of $31 million. The solicitation shall be made available via the Internet (www.fbo.gov) on or about 11 August 2008. Registration instructions are available at this website. Amendments, if any, will be available at this Internet site. Neither telephonic, mailed, nor faxed requests for solicitation documents will be accepted. All responsible HUBZone Small Business concerns may submit a bid, which will be considered by the New England District.

<a href="mailto:elizabeth.clark.ctr@usmc.mil">Contract Specialist</a>
<DESC>Marine Corps Systems Command intends to issue a competitive solicitation for the procurement and installation of commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) Suspension System Kits (SSK) for the Cougar platform upgrade efforts for the Joint Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) Vehicle Program (JMVP).  The Cougar platform requires increased effectiveness in an off-road mission profile. The vehicle must maximize protection levels and off-road mobility and maneuverability, and must balance the effects of size and increased weight requirements.  An upgraded SSK solution acquisition is being conducted under the authority of the JMVP.  The SSK shall include suspension components (spring and dampers), axles (solid or independent), steering systems, central tire inflation systems CTIS, brake systems, tires and wheels, and ancillary systems as required.  The proposals will be evaluated against current and future mission profiles and will allow evaluation of performance and the impact of t! he design on life cycle cost.  Expected design information includes hardware configurations, drawings, and other details as appropriate to ensure that a representative evaluation can be completed.  The Government will only consider mature designs with an established production base.  Offerors shall submit a proposal for a SSK solution that is a TRL 8 COTS item, production ready, and shall begin delivery of production kits within 90 days of contract award.  The proposed contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract with a contract minimum of two (2) Cougar Category I 4X4 and Category II 6X6 systems and maximum of approximately 1,200 and 440 Category I and II systems, respectively.  The RFP will allow the Government to award one or multiple IDIQ contracts to offeror(s) that as a result of evaluation of proposals and tests against the RFP evaluation criteria appear most capable of providing the lowest price, technically acce! ptable systems to the Government.  The kits shall be structured to be installable by 3rd echelon users in a field environment.  These kits shall require no welding or structural modification to the crew compartment part of the hull and shall consist of general hardware to the greatest extent possible, requiring no "special" tools to be used for installation.  If any non-standard tools are required to complete installation, the tools shall be provided as part of each vehicle kit, and not a separate line item.  If for proposal purposes access to vehicle variants is required to meet time line outlined, submit requests via e-mail to Elizabeth.Clark.Ctr@usmc.mil.  Site visits will be coordinated after release of the solicitation.  The criteria to be evaluated under the key performance parameters are Mobility, Cost and Schedule, Ride Quality, Survivability, Stability, and Reliability.  Offerors shall be required to submit (as a minimum) a technical, production, and cost proposal that addresses the capability to produce Category I and II SSKs at the ! specified quantity, meeting the required performance specifications and quality standards, within the required delivery schedule.

<DESC>LATVIA: AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM – ADVANCED MODERNIZATION PROGRAM

POC John Kusnierek, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT CONTRACTS OFFICE; PROPOSAL SUBMSSION PLACE: Tender Committee; SJSC Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme; Riga International Airport; Riga, LV-1053, Latvia; TEL.: +371-67-300-950; FAX: +371-67-300-970.  

Latvia: Air Traffic Management System – Advanced Modernization Program.  Latvijas Gaisa Satiksme (Grantee) invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to perform Technical Assistance in the planning and preparation phases of a comprehensive advanced modernization of Latvian Air Traffic Management System.

Since 2003 the air traffic volume at Riga International Airport (RIX) has increased at unprecedented annual rates. More recently, two carriers have expressed interest in offering direct intercontinental flights out of RIX, and in establishing the airport as a regional maintenance hub. While positive from an economic standpoint, these developments have begun to place strains on RIX’s current technology and infrastructure, and have made security concerns more acute. Considerable upgrades and expansion of the airport’s navigation and air traffic control (ATC) facilities are needed to accommodate the continuing growth.

The Grantee therefore intends to begin a complex modernization of the Latvian ATM systems’ infrastructure. The Grantee plans to do this via a comprehensive ATC upgrade, which entails introduction of a new area control center in Riga and a new ATC tower equipped with modern ATM system. In addition, The Grantee proposes to launch a program of ongoing modernizations that will maintain or replace outdated equipment on a regular basis. The USTDA-funded Technical Assistance in question will shape the Grantee’s implementation plan that is to proceed over the next ten years, refurbishing and accumulating facilities and equipment according to technological appropriateness and the availability of financing. The Grantee envisions total project costs of up to $130 million.

The Grantee is Latvia’s air traffic administrator – a state-administered joint-stock company that reports to the Latvian Ministry of Transport. It is responsible for all of Latvia’s air traffic navigation services. It coordinates search and rescue activities, performs aviation-related meteorological services, oversees ATM planning and flow, provides aeronautical aviation services, and contracts out for various technical and training services. Its organizational objectives are to ensure the safety and optimal use of Latvian airspace for all users, and to operate with financial self-sufficiency.

The U.S. firm selected to perform this Technical Assistance activity will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $690,170 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission/desk study report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.  To request the RFP in PDF format, please go to: https://www.ustda.gov/USTDA/FedBizOpps/RFP/rfpform.asp.  Requests for a mailed hardcopy version of the RFP may also be faxed to the IRC, USTDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm’s name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want USTDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to USTDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to USTDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, USTDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mail room before calling USTDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this USTDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under USTDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the USTDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the USTDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the USTDA grant amount.  Details of USTDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 pm on January 15, 2009 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: 

1.	Transaction # or Purchase order #:
523-09-1-9183-0037
2.	Identification of the agency and the contracting activity: 	VA Medical Center, Research - MAVERIC, Boston, MA			3.	Nature and/or description of the action being approved:
	Sole Source Procurement for Supplies/Services				4.   Description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs (including the estimated value):
RTS Blood Fractionation SystemVendor:  RTS Wright Industries	US Patent application 2006/0077376Price:  $750,890
The Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC) Core Laboratory processes and stores specimens for clinical trails run by the VA Cooperative Studies Program.  The laboratory has over a half million vials of specimens in 18 REVCO freezers and 19 MVE liquid nitrogen tanks.
Central Office is ramping up the ability of the laboratory to process specimens and has asked us to purchase an automated system for processing blood samples.  The automated system must be able to identify and separate the three components of blood (plasma, buffy coat, red cells) that are present after centrifuging blood specimens.  An automated system can process many more samples per day than a laboratory technician can and likely in a more precise manner.  Adding more technicians is expensive and requires the purchase of additional expensive safety engineering controls such as biological safety cabinets. In addition, the laboratory does not have room to add this equipment and there is little, if any, additional space available in the research building.  MAVERIC has already purchased one automated system from RTS, in order to provide a backup system; a duplicate of the automated system must be purchased.  Technical specifications of the two systems are identical and all components interchangeable.

5.	Identification of the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition:
	FAR 6.302-1, USC 253(c)(1) Only One Responsible Source.
6.	Demonstration that the proposed contractor's unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited:
RTS developed and has placed in service high throughput blood fractionation systems for both the UK Biobank and the HUNT Biobank in Norway. These systems are being used to separate blood into plasma, buff coats, and red cell aliquots for storage.  RTS developed this system and has patents pending on the process which may explain the lack of similar systems by other vendors.  	There are many systems on the market that can remove the top plasma layer.  These are widely used in clinical laboratories throughout the country.  However, these systems simply remove an aliquot of plasma from the top of the blood tube.  None of these systems can identify the buffy coat region that sits under the plasma layer and on top of the red cells.  This buffy coat is the most important component for the research laboratories because this is the component that contains the white cells and DNA.  It is critical that this component be separately stored.
7.	Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable, including whether a Commerce Business Daily notice was or will be publicized as required by Subpart 5.2 (copy attached) and, if not, which exception under 5.202 applies:
MAVERIC has already purchased (in FY 07) one automated blood fractionation system (set for delivery in 10/08).  Since the original purchase we recognized the need for a backup system in the event of breakdown or servicing of the 1st system.  In order to provide redundant capabilities, a second system must be purchased.  Addition of the second machine should provide continuous service of at least one machine in the lab at all times and guarantee that the lab is able to process the hundreds of blood specimens that will arrive from VA Hospitals each day.There is still no other commercially available machine that can perform the function of the RTS ABF500 machine (distinguish the three components of blood in a blood tube and separately aliquot the fractions).  Even if a another machine was available, robotic machines from two different vendors are not going to have the same exact specifications as the RTS automated fractionation system is patented.  This would mean parts are not interchangeable and a second system would not guarantee continuous operations in the laboratory.		8.	Determination by the contracting officer that the anticipated cost to the government will be fair and reasonable:
The cost to the Government will be determined to be fair and reasonable in accordance with criteria stipulated in FAR 15 and Historical data.

9.	Description of the market survey conducted (i.e., names of firms and the date(s) the firms were contacted) and the results, or a statement of the reasons a market survey was not conducted:
	None today.
10.	Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition, such as an explanation why technical data packages, specifications, engineering descriptions, statements of work, or purchase descriptions suitable for full and open competition have not been developed or are not available:
	None to date.

11.	A listing of the sources, if any, that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition:
	None to date.
12.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services required:
       Contracting Activity will continue to encourage full and open competition whenever possible.

SECTION C - DESCRIPTION / SPECIFICATION

ITEM 1. Automated Blood Fractionation System is a robotic processing system for fractionating whole blood.  This unit will be identical to the machine currently under order and will be installed in the MAVERIC Core Laboratory (RB-8).  On addition of centrifuged blood tubes, the system will read the bar-coded identifier on the tube and determine the locations of the blood fractions (plasma, buffy coat, red cells) within the tube.  The robotic system will automatically remove user-specified volumes of each fraction and separately aliquot into a user-specified number of bar-coded cryovials.  The system will track sample identifiers, specimen type, cryovial identifier, and sample location (rack ID and location within rack), and maintain a complete audit trail. 
The system specifications are identical to the ABF500 currently under order (ref: VA-241-P-0225) and covers the following stipulations as detailed in that document (except paragraph h which has been modified to suit delivery of this second instrument):
a) The system design must have the flexibility to work with cryovials and vacutainers of our specification. The cryovials must be compatible with an automated capper/decapper system.
b) The system must operate in a continuous mode, ie the user will be able to load single racks of centrifuged vacutainers part way through the run.
c) Automatically read bar codes of tubes and racks at each stage so that a complete audit trail is maintained. This should include tracking the ID of each sample processed as well as the location of each aliquot within the sample output racks (ie rack ID and position).
d) The system must have the ability to cope with a wide range of blood samples, including differences in the volume of blood in each tube and also the consistency of each blood fraction.
e) The system must have the ability to separate the three components of centrifuged blood,including plasma, buffy coat, and red cells. Once these three levels have been identified they must be automatically transferred to separate cryovials.
f) The system must include an 8 tip pipettor with liquid level detection, a camera based vision system to detect fractions, and controlling software.
g) The system must be able to process at a minimum 500 samples per day.
h) Delivery date to be confirmed but will be on or before September 30, 2009.
i. The purchase price includes a one year warranty that includes all machine parts, software, and service to maintain normal operation of the automated blood fractionation system.
j) The system will be installed in R8-8 (Research Laboratory), of the Boston VAHCS, Jamaica Plain campus. The primary point of contact in coordinating the installation of the equipment isDonald Humphries, PhD, Scientific Director, MAVERIC Laboratory.

<RESPDATE>120508
<ARCHDATE>12062008
<CONTACT>Vi Ta, Email vtta@bpa.gov
<DESC><p><strong>PURPOSE</strong>
<p>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI) only for the purposes of conducting market research and does not obligate the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) in any way. This is not a request for proposal and BPA will not pay for any information submitted or for any expenses associated with providing information. Responses are due no later than December 5th, 2008.</p>
<p>Any information submitted by respondents to this RFI is strictly voluntary. Material submitted will be deemed proprietary to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations if so marked by the respondent.</p>
<p>BPA's acquisition practices are not governed by the same rules and regulations of other federal agencies. BPA acquisitions are subject to the policies and procedures outlined in the Bonneville Purchasing Instructions (BPI) which is available for viewing at: <a href="http://www.bpa.gov/corporate/business/bpi/">http://www.bpa.gov/corporate/business/bpi/</a>.</p>
<p><br /><strong>GOAL</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this contract is to provide BPA with clear guidance on the legal principles and applicable case law with regards to retracement surveys of BPA rights of way. The BPA Survey and Mapping Section will formulate a policy based upon the guidance and research provided by this contract.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p>
<p>The BPA Surveying and Mapping Section maintain an ongoing encroachment survey program that is used to support the Realty Services Section in protecting BPA rights of way. With the constant and increased threat of development around and adjacent to BPA right of ways, the need to have a legally sound policy with regards to the retracement surveys of our right of ways is imperative.</p>
<p>When BPA acquired rights of ways from 1937 up until the 1990's, surveyors would tie corners of occupation such as fence corners, road intersections, field lines, etc. When describing the parcel in the deed, they would refer to these occupation corners as section (or quarter) corners and use them as the point of beginning in the deed. Now, some of these locations have been monumented (whether correctly or incorrectly) and some are in different locations than BPA had called in right of way deed(s). Due to this confusion, BPA finds itself in constant disagreement with private land surveyors who have located our rights of way in differing locations due to the ambiguous locations of the point of beginning, leading to conflicts that occasionally move to the court system.</p>
<p><strong>LOCATION</strong></p>
<p>The results of the proposed research should be applicable to the BPA system, which includes all, or parts, of 4 northwestern states. Research will be required for all states that lie within BPA's service territory (Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana).</p>
<p><strong>DELIVERABLES</strong></p>
<p>The contractor will provide a bound report which will contain, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>A detailed analysis of findings; the analysis will include:</p>
<p>Table of contents</p>
<p>A preface, which will include a brief synopsis of the questions/concerns/requests presented to the contractor in the Statement of Work and a synopsis of the contractor's opinion as to the best course of action for BPA's future policy.</p>
<p>The contractor's full opinion as to the best course of action for BPA to approach the policy of retracing BPA rights of way (this may include different solutions for individual states if warranted).</p>
<p>A synopsis of each applicable Local/State/Federal court case that could be used by BPA to develop the new policy, including the contractor's opinion as to how each case could help or hinder BPA's future policy.</p>
<p>Devise a scoring system and score all cases relevant to retracing BPA rights of way and provide a score sheet for each case. The score sheets will be arraigned by jurisdiction (including supporting documentation). Also include the entire ruling for each case (in the appendixes, include any lower court ruling if the case had been appealed).</p>
<p>The full report shall be the property of the Bonneville Power Administration and the BPA will reserve the right to reproduce and use at their discretion. An electronic copy of the entire analysis and supporting documentation will also be delivered on CD or DVD format.</p>
<p>The contractor will also give a detailed briefing to BPA personnel about the findings of the analysis performed. The briefing will be held at BPA's Two Park Place building in Vancouver, Washington. This briefing will conclude with a thorough question and answer session. The briefing and Q &amp; A session should last an entire day.</p>
<p><strong>Requested Information</strong></p>
<p>The Contractor must be a licensed surveyor with a background in property laws. A law degree is preferred.</p>
<p>Interested vendors may submit their capabilities and qualifications and any other pertinent information should they choose. At a minimum, please include the following information for your firm: <br />&bull; Resume<br />&bull; Company name <br />&bull; Address and/or website <br />&bull; Phone and Fax number<br />&bull; E-mail address <br />&bull; Point of contact</p>

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for RIA Quotation 
A.	General Information.  
 The Northeast Region, Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 44 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia seeks to initiate the standardization process for Surgical Tape.             
Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied and product literature (electronic catalog or electronic marketing material with either describing product line items in detail) in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFRIAQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.
The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product(s) or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.

The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, MD; Dewitt Healthcare System, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, Westpoint, NY; and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, FT Meade, MD.  

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the PV Program.  The RFRIAQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCP PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.   

The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of five (5) years.  Anticipated selection date is February 2009.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be cased on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  The selected vendor(s) of the standardization initiative are to submit a copy of the signed RIA along with the DAPA log number to both the TRBO lead logistician and the DSCP COR when submitting the log.  Point of Contact is Tracy Martin-Tilghman, Team Logistician, Phone:  202-782-3663, and email: tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil.    

B.	Products & Performance Required.

C.	Instructions to Vendors.  
DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria with accompanying electronic product literature, and the following information--(1) Company name and address, (2) Company Point of Contact (POC Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the following Northeast Region POC:  larry.shaughnesy@us.army.mil (202-782-3666) and tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil (202 782-3663) as a back up.  All email communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT/EST on 18 December 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. 
This process will include the above vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria, electronic product literature, no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best value price quotes when requested.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region POC stated above that their initial submission, product literature, and best price submissions when requested actually arrived at the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  Additionally, vendors will be required to notify the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets.  Voicemail messages for the confirmation of the receipt of the TRBO email request for the no-cost sample sets will NOT be accepted to meet this requirement.           

D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  
The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Northeast Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  

Phase I – Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  
Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate, the required company/company POC information, electronic product literature, and detailed responses to the technical/company criteria listed below to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria responses, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:  a. Based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services. b. The vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  
2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be sent forth with the individual criterion.  
3.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:

1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Surgical Tape products.  A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  
	a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes self-adhesive, surgical tape in a variety of materials and widths as follows:  

i.   Silk-type material tape in sizes:        1”, 2”, and 3” widths.
 ii. Cloth-type material tape in sizes:     ½”, 1”, 2”, 3”, 4” and 6” widths.
iii. Plastic-type tape material in sizes:    1”, 2”, and 3” widths

b. Vendors must provide a complete list of product line items supplied and product literature (electronic catalog or electronic marketing material with either describing product line items in detail) in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed above.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line as listed above will be disqualified in Phase I.  
	c. Products’ packaging must be clearly labeled as to contents and must include manufacturing lot number and must include expiration date as appropriate.        
      d. Vendors must provide Surgical Tape products that are latex-free.  Vendors must provide documentation that Surgical Tape products are latex-free in response to this RFRIAQ.       

2.  Vendors must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) with Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP) or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the Surgical Tape product line.  Provide the DAPA number or proof of the application process in progress in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified in Phase I.    

3.  Vendors must have a separate agreement with the prime vendor (PV) (currently the Prime Vendor for the Northeast Region is Owens-Minor) for distribution within the Northeast Region.  Vendors whose products are not available through the current regional PV will be disqualified.  Provide documentation of agreement with PV in response to this RFRIAQ.

4.  Vendors must submit discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative.  Vendors that fail to submit a discount from DAPA will be disqualified. Where lower uncommitted FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the uncommitted FSS price as the DAPA price.  Vendors shall not quote uncommitted FSS prices as the discounted price for purposes of this standardization initiative.  Vendors are to provide quote on discounts, in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors who do not provide discounts off DAPA for all products in this product line will be disqualified.    

5.  Vendors must provide a local vendor representative for product implementation and customer servicing as required for the Medical Treatment Facilities (MTF) in the Northeast Region.  Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and email address in response to this RFRIAQ. 

6.  Vendor MUST provide all history of back orders and recalls that occurred during the most recent 12-month period for the Surgical Tape product line including dates, duration, cause, and resolution.  Vendors will not have an opportunity to provide additional information on back orders and recall during any subsequent stage in this standardization process.  Vendors are encouraged to submit all information deemed relevant (i.e., positive resolutions, etc.) in response to this RFRIAQ.  The Government will not contact any provided points of contact in response to this criteria.  Vendors should not provide point of contact information in response to this criterion.  

Phase II – Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process 
Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets and literature from the product group at no cost to the Government or the TRBO POC recipient, to be sent to the TRBO, Clinical Analyst for dissemination to the CPT members for evaluation in a clinical setting.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting the no-cost product sample sets in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets to the TRBO Clinical Analyst.  NOTE:  Vendors will be required to notify the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office TRBO, Clinical Analyst by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets.  Voicemail messages for the confirmation of the receipt of the TRBO email request for the no-cost sample sets will NOT be accepted to meet this requirement.  Requested no-cost product sample sets and literature must be shipped to arrive at the TRBO Clinical Analyst address no later than the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets.  Vendors who do not deliver the no-cost product samples by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for no-cost product sample sets.  Vendor’s presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. 

The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for one (1) calendar day.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendor’s product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (non-patient) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)—Extremely Poor; Two (2)—Below Average; Three (3)—Average; Four (4)—Above Average; and Five (5)—Excellent.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   

The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative—at or near 3.50—depending on the location of any “break:” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  

Evaluation will take place in a non-clinical (non-patient-care setting) using non-patient volunteers.  Evaluators will evaluate the performance of the products in the sample set one (1) time each using a 4” x 4” plain gauze sponge as a sample dressing and an intravenous extension tubing as the sample medical device.   The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative with a Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.50:  

1.  (Efficiency of Care) Tape tears easily in multiple directions.        
      a. Multi-directional tearing allows for customizing tape sizes for securing dressings/ medical devices to the skin.           
b. Evaluator will tear tape in several directions (width and length) and assess for ease of tearing.    
2.  (Efficiency of Care/Infection Control/Patient Safety) Tape adhesive adheres well to    dressing/skin.   
a. Quality of the tape adhesive allows for secure attachment of a dressing/medical device to the skin without loosening.            
b. Evaluator will tape dressing material/medical device to skin of volunteer and assess for adherence to skin without loosening.        
3.  (Efficiency of Care) Tape is easy to manipulate while wearing medical gloves.  
a. Ease of manipulating tape while wearing medical gloves is important so as not to compromise glove integrity or dislodge dressings/medical devices.          
b. Evaluator will tear tape and secure dressing/medical device while wearing medical gloves and assess for ease of manipulating tape and assess for compromise to integrity of medical glove.    
4.   (Efficiency of Care/Patient Comfort/Safety/Infection Control) Tape adhesive maintains the integrity of the skin during and after removal.    
	a. Maintaining skin integrity during and after taping dressings/medical devices in important for protecting patient from further injury.    
	b. Evaluator will taped dressing/medical device and observe for compromise to the skin such as redness, irritation, or skin tearing.   

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  
1.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region—represents the new estimated total annual cost including matched and unmatched products—and  reflects the amount the Region would pay  using the RIA pricing.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines—unmatched products make vendor comparisons difficult and those in the high usage category has higher impact for post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor—reduction of the number of SKUs handled per period is the intent of the Region; therefore, vendors supplying the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, are more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.  The impact of RIA prices on the Northeast Region is considered more important than the other pricing elements.      
2.  Vendors that are determined to be Acceptable after review of their responses to the  technical/company criteria, are qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will be requested to submit best value pricing, a competitive product cross reference, and value-adds based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The quote will be requested to be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Those vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria, are not qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and do meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any “break” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will not be requested to submit pricing quotes and will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.      
3.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the notice to submit RIA pricing quotes, the competitive product cross reference, and value adds in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Price quotes, cross reference, and value adds must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice to submit.  Those vendors that fail to respond by the deadline date/time will be disqualified from further consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.

4.  The Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested I the notice to submit RIA pricing.  Vendor’s quotes should contain the vendor’s best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  
The Northeast Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to make a down selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.   
5.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for RIA Quotation 
A.	General Information.  
 The Northeast Region, Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 44 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia seeks to initiate the standardization process for Steam Sterilization Indicators – Chemical.               
Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFRIAQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.
The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product(s) or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.

The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, MD; Dewitt Healthcare Network, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, Westpoint, NY; and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, FT Meade, MD.  

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the PV Program.  The RFRIAQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCP PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.   

The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of five (5) years.  Anticipated selection date is March 2009.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors when combined are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be cased on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  The selected vendor(s) of the standardization initiative are to submit a copy of the signed RIA along with the DAPA log number to both the TRBO lead logistician and the DSCP COR when submitting the log.  Point of Contact is Tracy Martin-Tilghman, Team Logistician, Phone:  202-782-3663, and email: tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil.

Vendor’s presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. 

The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one  (21) calendar days.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendor’s product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (sterile processing department) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a  Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)—Strongly Disagree; Two (2)—Disagree; Three (3)—Neutral; Four (4)—Agree; and Five (5)—Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   

The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative—at or near 3.50—depending on the location of any “break:” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  

Following the manufacturer’s instructions/guidelines, the evaluation of Class I Chemical Process Indicators and Class V Chemical Integrator Indicators will take place at each Military Treatment Facility (MTF) evaluation site in a non-clinical environment (sterile processing department) using a Laparotomy Set (or similar instrument set) in an instrument pan, and using a Small Fragmentation Set (or similar instrument set) in a wrapped tray as sample test trays during five (5) regularly scheduled vacuum-assisted steam sterilization process cycles.  Following the manufacturer’s instructions/guidelines, Evaluation of Class II Chemical Process Indicators (Bowie-Dick type test) will take place at each MTF evaluation site in a non-clinical environment (sterile processing department) during five (5) regularly scheduled vacuum-assisted steam sterilization process cycles (pack loads).  Evaluators will evaluate the performance of each type of Indicator in the Sample Set with the sample test trays and pack loads during the five (5) sterilization process cycles using the following established Quality Control/Patient Safety category clinical/performance criteria with a Clinical Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.50:       
         
      1.   The Class I, II, and V Chemical Steam Sterilization Indicator product packaging clearly 
            indicates the type of Indicator for which type of steam sterilization process.            
      a. Chemical Steam Sterilization Indicators are specific to the type of sterilization process to assure the successful sterile processing of surgical instruments.             
b. Evaluator will assess for the ease of determining the type of Chemical Steam Sterilization Indicator by examining the product packaging.      
2.   The Class I Chemical Process Indicators (Class I External Pack Tape and Tag) are easy to attach to sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan.     
a. Class I Chemical Process Indicators must attach easily and securely to determine the successful sterile processing of surgical instruments.              
b. Evaluator will attach Class I External Pack Tape and Tag Indicators to sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan and assess for ease/security of attachment.          
3.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed, the Class I Chemical Process Indicator (Class I External Pack Tape and Tag) response can be easily determined to assess for exposure to the sterilization process cycle.    
a. Class I Chemical Process Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the exposure to the sterilization process cycle to assure the successful sterile processing of surgical instruments.              
b. Evaluator will visually inspect the Indicators for ease of determining exposure to the sterilization process cycle.        
4.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed the Class I Chemical Process Indicators (Class External Pack Tape and Tag) do not easily detach from sample test wrapped trays and instrument pans.  
      a. Class I Chemical Process Indicators must remain securely attached to instrument packs to differentiate processed/unprocessed instrument packs in inventory/storage.  
      b. Evaluate will assess for secure attachment of Indicators after the completed sterilization process cycle.  
5.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed the Class II Chemical Process Indicator (Bowie-Dick type test) response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle (pack load).      
	a. Class II Chemical Process Indicators (Bowie-Dick type test) must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments.      
	b. Before pack load is sterilized, Class II Chemical Process Indicator is placed in pack load according to manufacturer’s guidelines/instructions.  After process cycle is completed, evaluator will visually inspect the Indicator for ease of determining exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.
6.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed the Class V Chemical Integrator Indicator response can be easily determined as Safe/Sterile or Unsafe/Unsterile for sample test wrapped trays and instrument pans.
      a. Class V Chemical Integrator Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments.
            b. Before sample test wrapped tray and instrument pan is sterilized, Class V Chemical 
            Integrator Indicator is place inside sample test tray/pan according to manufacturer’s    
            guidelines/instructions.  After process cycle is completed evaluator will visually inspect 
            the Indicators for ease of determining successful exposure to the sterilization process 
            cycle.  

Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  
1.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region—represents the new estimated total annual cost including matched and unmatched products—and  reflects the amount the Region would pay  using the RIA pricing.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines—unmatched products make vendor comparisons difficult and those in the high usage category has higher impact for post-standardization costs.  (3) Consideration of SKUs by each vendor—reduction of the number of SKUs handled per period is the intent of the Region; therefore, vendors supplying the complete range of clinically-required product, without unnecessary numbers of SKUs for minimally-differentiated products, are more likely to provide the best-value solution for the Government in this standardization initiative.    
2.  Vendors that are determined to be Acceptable after review of their responses to the  technical/company criteria, are qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will be requested to submit best value pricing, a competitive product cross reference, and value-adds based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The quote will be requested to be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Those vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria, are not qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and do meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any “break” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will not be requested to submit pricing quotes and will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.      
3.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the notice to submit RIA pricing quotes, the competitive product cross reference, and value adds in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Price quotes, cross reference, and value adds must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice to submit.  Those vendors that fail to respond by the deadline date/time will be disqualified from further consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.

4.  The Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the notice to submit RIA pricing.  Vendor’s quotes should contain the vendor’s best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  
The Northeast Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to make a down selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.   
5.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.

<DESC>65-Medical Supplies-Request for RIA Quotation 
A.	General Information.  
 The Northeast Region, Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) REG 1, a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 44 Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in the states of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, and Virginia seeks to initiate the standardization process for Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological.                 
Vendors MUST provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this Request for RIA Quotes (RFRIAQ).  Vendors are required to supply all items listed in all sizes and styles listed.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line, as detailed below in usage items, will be disqualified in Phase I.
The primary objective of this program is to standardize the quality of care across this region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product(s) or source(s) at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor (PV) Program.

The major facilities in the Northeast Region include, but are not limited to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC; National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD; Malcolm Grow Medical Center, Andrews AFB, MD; Dewitt Healthcare Network, FT Belvoir, VA; Keller Army Community Hospital, Westpoint, NY; and Kimbrough Ambulatory Care Center, FT Meade, MD.  

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical PV program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel.  To participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the PVs for the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the standardization process and to allow PV to distribute their items.  This RFRIAQ will result in Regional Incentive Agreements that supplement the PV Program.  The RFRIAQ will not result in a contract award.  For additional information regarding DSCP PV program, please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.   

The resulting RIA will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods for a maximum of five (5) years.  Anticipated selection date is March 2009.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors when combined are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.  The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be cased on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  The selected vendor(s) of the standardization initiative are to submit a copy of the signed RIA along with the DAPA log number to both the TRBO lead logistician and the DSCP COR when submitting the log.  Point of Contact is Tracy Martin-Tilghman, Team Logistician, Phone:  202-782-3663, and email: tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil.

DAPA holders interested in participating in this standardization initiative should email their detailed electronic responses to the technical/company criteria with accompanying electronic product literature, and the following information--(1) Company name and address, (2) Company Point of Contact (POC Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address) to the following Northeast Region POC:  larry.shaughnesy@us.army.mil (202-782-3666) and tracy.martintilghman@us.army.mil (202-782-3663) as a back up.  All email communication between vendors and the region must be digitally signed.  All communications of significant acquisition milestones (such as invitations to participate, or notices of disqualification) must be digitally signed as well.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EDT/EST on 18 December 2008.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. 
This process will include the above vendor requirements to provide electronic responses to technical/company criteria, electronic product literature, no-cost samples for clinical evaluation when requested, and submission of electronic best value price quotes when requested.  Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Northeast Region POC stated above that their initial submission, product literature, and best price submissions when requested actually arrived at the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC via email.  Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt, allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  All email communications between vendors and the Northeast Region must be digitally signed by the issuer.  Additionally, vendors will be required to notify the Northeast Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) POC by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets.  Voicemail messages for the confirmation of the receipt of the TRBO email request for the no-cost sample sets will NOT be accepted to meet this requirement.           

D.	 Evaluation Criteria.  
The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process.  This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the MTFs within the Northeast Region.  They are the deciding officials for this initiative.  

Phase I – Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  
Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate, the required company/company POC information, electronic product literature, and detailed responses to the technical/company criteria listed below to the above POC by the required response date.  Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below.  All technical/company criteria are weighted equally.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB and the Clinical Product Team (CPT) to determine the acceptability of each vendor.  After review of the technical/company criteria responses, those vendors who meet these criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.  

1.  In general, acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria is defined as follows:  a. Based on the vendor’s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services. b. The vendor’s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.  
2.  Each technical/company criteria below requires additional, more specific definition of technical acceptability.  This specific standard for technical acceptability will be sent forth with the individual criterion.  
3.  The vendors who meet the following technical/company criteria will be qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation process via an email communication with each vendor.  The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for the standardization initiative:

1. Vendor must provide a complete line of Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological products.  A complete line of product is defined as the Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.  
	a. At a minimum, a complete product line includes Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological for Vacuum-Assisted and Gravity Displacement Steam sterilization processes as follows:      
 
                  i.   Biological Indicators in self-contained vials with response/read-out times
                       of 3-hours (with controls and incubators).  

b. Vendors must provide a complete list of items supplied (catalog, etc.) and product literature in response to this RFRIAQ.  Vendors are required to supply all items listed above.  Vendors who do not have a complete product line as listed above will be disqualified in Phase I.  
	c. Vendors must provide supporting documentation that all Steam Sterilization Indicators – Biological that are manufactured and/or distributed are FDA approved and meet current ANSO/AAMI standards for this product line.  Provide literature to support this requirement with the initial submittal.          
      d. Vendors must provide information on the reliability, safety, and performance characteristics of their products including the interpretation of the Indicators results, the endpoint-response maintenance during storage, the sterilization conditions that the Indicators will detect, the shelf life of the Indicators., and the storage requirements for the Indicators themselves before and after sterilization (ANSI/AAMI ST79P 2006) with the initial submittal.  
	e. Vendors must provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions for testing, safety, and end-point values for all Indicators.  Provide manufacturing guidelines/instructions with the initial submittal.         
	f. Vendors must provide a statement indicating their products/packaging related to this product line is latex-safe/free with the initial submittal.  
      g. Vendors MUST provide specific product information (brand, model, cost, etc.) of proprietary incubator used for Biological Indicators and Controls in response to this RFRIAQ. 

Phase II – Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process 
Following acceptability of the technical/company criteria, the TRBO, on behalf of the Clinical Product Team (CPT), will request product sample sets—including no-cost controls, incubators, and pre-paid return shipping invoice for incubator equipment—and literature from the product group at no cost to the Government or POC recipient, to be sent to designated CPT members from participating MTFs for evaluation in a non-clinical setting.  In those instances where evaluation equipment (incubators) must be ordered through a specific military protocol /procedure with the vendor, the vendor MUST provide a representative who will coordinate and serve as vendor POC with the MTF POC for this protocol/procedure and no-cost evaluation equipment shipping/delivery and return with vendor pre-paid return shipping invoice.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the issue of the notice requesting the no-cost product sample sets, etc., as specified above in which to deliver the no-cost sample sets, etc., to the designated CPT members.  NOTE:  Vendors will be required to notify the TRBO, Clinical Analyst by phone upon the receipt of the email request for the no-cost sample sets, etc., as specified above.  Voicemail messages for the confirmation of the receipt of the TRBO email request for the no-cost sample sets, etc., as specified above will NOT be accepted to meet this requirement.  Requested no-cost sample sets, etc., as specified above, and literature must be shipped to arrive at the designated CPT member address no later than the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost sample sets.  Vendors who do not deliver the no-cost sample sets including no-cost controls, incubator, and pre-paid return shipping invoice to any or all shipping/delivery destinations by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice requesting no-cost product sample sets, etc., as specified above will be disqualified from this standardization initiative.  Vendors who do not provide a representative who will coordinate and serve as vendor POC with the MTF POC for the protocol/procedure and no-cost evaluation equipment (incubator) shipping/delivery and return as applicable will be disqualified from further consideration in this standardization initiative process.  NOTE: all vendors must send the TRBO verification regarding the quantity, products, description of items, and date of shipment from the vendor, anticipated delivery date and individual who signed for no-cost sample sets in addition to the name of the vendor representative as specified above as appropriate.  Vendor’s presence will not be required for in-servicing prior to the evaluations. 

The clinical/performance evaluation period will last for twenty-one (21) calendar days.  Specific CPT members will evaluate the vendor’s product sample sets against the clinical/performance criteria in a non-clinical (sterile processing department) setting.  The evaluation responses will be recorded using a Likert scale format with a 1-5 scoring range.  The scale descriptors are: One (1)—Strongly Disagree; Two (2)—Disagree; Three (3)—Neutral; Four (4)—Agree; and Five (5)—Strongly Agree.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally.   

The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.50 for the Clinical Acceptability of products for standardization.  The CPT will determine the actual Acceptability threshold for this standardization initiative—at or near 3.50—depending on the location of any “break:” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores).  In addition, the CPT may consider how closely scores are clustered near the Acceptability target threshold of 3.50, in determining the actual Acceptability threshold.  Vendors scoring below the actual Acceptability threshold will be determined to be clinically Unacceptable, and be disqualified from further consideration for this standardization initiative.  

Following the manufacturer’s instructions/guidelines, the evaluation of Biological Indicators will take place at each Military Treatment Facility (MTF) evaluation site in a non-clinical environment (sterile processing department).  Evaluators will evaluate the performance of the Biological Indicators/Controls used in pack loads during five (5) sterilization process cycles using the following established Quality Control/Patient Safety category clinical/performance criteria:       
         
      1.   The Biological Indicator/Control product packaging clearly indicates the type of Indicator
            for which type of steam sterilization process.            
      a. Biological Indicators are specific to the type of sterilization process to assure the successful sterile processing of surgical instruments.             
b. Evaluator will assess for the ease of determining the type of Biological Indicator by examining the product packaging.      
2.   After the sterilization process cycle is completed the initial Biological Indicator response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle.        
	a. Biological Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments.      
	b. Before pack load is sterilized, the Biological Indicator is placed in pack load according to manufacturer’s guidelines/instructions.  After process cycle is completed, evaluator will visually inspect the Indicator for ease of determining exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.
3.   After complete incubation with Control, the Biological Indicator and Control response can be easily determined for exposure to the sterilization process cycle (No Growth of Biological Indicator/Growth of Control).    
      a. Biological Indicators must clearly indicate the success/failure of the sterilization process cycle to assess the sterility of surgical instruments; Controls must clearly indicate growth of biological as a comparison.  
      b. After process cycle is completed and Biological Indicator has completed the required incubation period, evaluator will visually inspect the Indicator/Control for ease of determining appropriate response (No Growth of Indicator/Growth of Control) indicating exposure of pack load to the sterilization process cycle.                  


Phase III – Pricing Analysis Process.  
1.  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices (Post-Standardization Costs) on the Northeast Region—represents the new estimated total annual cost including matched and unmatched products—and  reflects the amount the Region would pay  using the RIA pricing.  (2) Impact of Unmatched Lines—unmatched products make vendor comparisons difficult and those in the high usage category has higher impact for post-standardization costs.

2.  Vendors that are determined to be Acceptable after review of their responses to the  technical/company criteria, are qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any "break" in vendors’ average scores (i.e., a gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will be requested to submit best value pricing, a competitive product cross reference, and value-adds based on a committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the Northeast Region.  The quote will be requested to be in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Those vendors who do not meet the technical/company criteria, are not qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation, and do meet the clinical Acceptability target threshold of 3.50—depending on the location of any “break” in vendors’ average scores (i.e., gap between vendors’ average scores) as determined by the CPT—will not be requested to submit pricing quotes and will be disqualified from further consideration.  Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.      
3.  Vendors will be given fourteen (14) calendar days from the date of the notice to submit RIA pricing quotes, the competitive product cross reference, and value adds in a prescribed electronic spreadsheet format.  Price quotes, cross reference, and value adds must be received by 4:00 PM EDT on the 14th calendar day after the date of the notice to submit.  Those vendors that fail to respond by the deadline date/time will be disqualified from further consideration. Vendors that have been disqualified will be notified in writing at the conclusion of the standardization process.

4.  The Northeast Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), on initial submissions/quotes.  Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in the notice to submit RIA pricing.  Vendor’s quotes should contain the vendor’s best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Northeast Region).  
The Northeast Region reserves the right to limit the number of quotes to the greatest number that will permit an efficient competition among vendors.  The Northeast Region reserves the right to make a down selection during the evaluation process based on considerations of efficient competition.   
5.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the evaluation results become more technically/clinically equal, price will become more important.  Pricing will be evaluated based on a best-value, lowest-overall-cost alternative to the Government and will be based on a committed volume for a two (2) years (24 months) from date of selection with three (3) 12-month option periods not to exceed a total of five (5) years.

PROGRAM BACKGROUND 

The Naval Aviation Survival Training Program (NASTP), under mandates of OPNAV 3710.7 requires training for Navy/Marine Corps aircrew in Parachute Over-Water and Helicopter Hoisting Emergency procedures. The training systems are intended to provide Navy/Marine Corps personnel specialized training to maintain a high state of proficiency and to instill confidence while developing instinctive performance of the skills required in these emergency scenarios.  The Navy currently has two separate trainers: Device 9F9A intended for executing emergency procedures associated with a parachute descent and water entry following aircraft bailout/ejection; Device 9H1 intended for executing emergency procedures used during a rescue from water by a helicopter.  The Navy is interested in solutions that would minimize the device(s) deck space requirement while optimizing student flow.  The training solution should allow for both training evolutions to be operated simultaneously.

REQUIRED CAPABILITIES

The Government requires the design, development and installation of three (3) new multi-capable Navy Water Survival/ Rescue Training Systems; one at NAS Lemoore, CA, one at MCAS Miramar, CA and one at MCAS Cherry Point, NC.  The intent of this Sources Sought is to allow the Navy to make an informed decision concerning the strategy it will pursue to meet its objectives and, if the Navy elects to proceed with a procurement, to structure the solicitation to maximize interest and encourage innovative and imaginative proposals. 

The Government envisions a solution for the new Navy Water Survival/ Rescue Training System that meets the following operational and program requirements:

1.  Human Factors Engineering.  The Navy Water Survival/ Rescue Training System must provide realistic, effective, hands-on training for Navy/Marine Corps aircrew in Parachute Over-Water and Helicopter Hoisting Emergency procedures.  The proposed training system must consider student/instructor safety and student throughput.  The training system should also consider ancillary environmental realism effects such as helicopter rotor downwash, lighting, sound and wind.

2.  Selection of appropriate Materials.  The Navy Water Survival/ Rescue Training System should maximize use of non-corrosive materials, fasteners and conduit. These training systems will be located adjacent to a chlorinated swimming pool.  Two of the pool facilities are indoors and one is outdoor.

3.  Reliability.  The Navy Water Survival/ Rescue Training System should provide reliability of no less than a Mean-Time-Between-Failure of 20,000 cycles and no more than a Mean-Time-To-Repair of 8 hours.

4.  Maintenance, Inspection and Repair.  The Navy Water Survival/ Rescue Training System should require minimal maintenance and inspection.  The system should be easily maintainable and repairable by Government organic technical personnel.      

5.  Life Cycle Support.  The Navy Water Survival/ Rescue Training System should consider commonality of design.  All three proposed systems should be as common as possible to support logistic considerations such as maintenance manuals, configuration control and spare parts.

6.  Facility Considerations.  The Navy Water Survival/ Rescue Training System should consider interfaces with facility electrical power, water supply and plumbing, existing structures, existing trainers, HVAC, and OSHA requirements.

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

Any resulting contract shall be compliant with the specialty metals restriction of the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C. 2533a and 2533b) in accordance with DFARS 225.7002 and DFARS clause 252.225-7014 Alt. 1, inclusive of Class Deviations 2008-O0002 (which supersedes 2006-O004 and 2007-O011), unless an exception applies.

<DESC>Next Generation Mail Processing Technologies:

The United States Postal Service (USPS) is initiating a new acquisition program entitled “Next Generation Mail Processing Solution” to identify participants and sources of supply, capable of providing research and development, design, and in or out sourced manufacturing for a new state-of-the-art, automated, mail processing design solution.  This solution will be deployed to sort and sequence the high volume of letter and flat mail currently processed within USPS facilities nationwide.

This market notice and supply chain opportunity is ultimately seeking suppliers who can offer new or not previously fielded concepts or variations of existing equipment, having an achievable maturation path leading to deployable equipment commencing within the next six years.

This initial notice is providing for market research and publication of opportunity, with a following step of additional discussions related to supplier capabilities and qualifications for inclusion within a competitive process toward the above goal.

Current Mail Processing Operational Information:

Currently, the Postal Service processes approximately 550 million letter and flat mail pieces at 283 processing facilities each day.  The USPS segregates letter and flat shaped mail as it enters processing, and this separation is maintained throughout the sorting process.  Our existing automated process yields a high volume of sorted mail to a finite number of delivery points.  Several high speed processing runs are performed each day to accommodate all delivery points within a single mail processing centers’ coverage area.  Letter and flat mail is manually merged during the final processing operations by our street carriers for delivery to the addressee.

NGMPS Program Objectives:

The NGMPS Program Objective is to deploy a system solution which will be capable of efficiently, reliably and accurately delivery point sequencing both letter and flat mail simultaneously within a merged mail stream and within the same system.  As space is a cost consideration for the USPS, the solution should utilize and accomplish this task within the smallest footprint possible.  The required output of the system is a single, combined mail stream for letter and flat mail in delivery point sequence order.  Designed solutions should consider the use of specifically designed letter and flat mail input subsystems, or use feeders currently deployed within the Postal Service.  Deployment of equipment to individual delivery units is not desired and does not meet the Postal Service’s future vision.  Competitive factors for success will be sort and sequence accuracy, time to process, and the systems ability to support our established high standards of service for the American people.  Additional factors are projected to be development cost to bring to market, system reliability, accept rate, labor cost to operate, and overall space required to accomplish the mission.  Finally through NGMPS, the USPS seeks a system which can be deployed nationally and incrementally to provide maximum flexibility to delivery point sequence letter and flat shaped mail within existing and future Postal Service infrastructure.  

Future Mail Trend Impact on NGMPS:

Research indicates a shift in mailing trends propelled by the numerous means of communication options available to business and consumers today.  These trends are characterized by slower mail volume growth and continued increases in the number of delivery points.  As volume growth slows, emphasis must shift to accommodate more delivery points with less volume.  A new solution with processing based upon the volume of mail available, with delivery points as the variable, would provide an opportunity to streamline operations.  Processing letter and flat shaped mail on one system (using either a single induction feeder or multiple induction feeders to accommodate the varying mail shapes) would eliminate the manual merging process, improve efficiencies, and reduce costs.  The most efficient processing scenario would be a one feed solution for letter and flat mail, independent of delivery points, limited only by a maximum volume, which would provide a merged letter and flat mail product in delivery point order. The NGMPS Program is seeking such a solution.

NGMPS Acquisition Approach:

The Postal Service will provide for a supplier prequalification and competitive process through identified Phases leading to test and production deployment.  The Postal Service is reviewing alternative approaches to ensure that it provides for selection of a best value solution which ensures supply base availability to support future deployment phases, quantity acquisitions, and system upgrades.

Suppliers interested in responding to this announcement wishing to participate in this program should send their contact information to Ms. Tammi Robinson-Minor, Purchasing and Supply Management Specialist, United States Postal Service, Automation CMC, 8403 Lee Highway, Fairfax, VA  22082-8150.  Email address is tammi.robinson-minor@usps.gov.  Telephone:  (703) 280-7885.  Telephone inquires and questions will be addressed, however, for action concerning participation, inquiries must be in writing.  Suppliers should provide for notification of interest as soon as practicable, and in no event later than December 15, 2008. 

Upon required written notification of interest, the USPS will provide additional information for supplier response within a prequalification process, with successful suppliers moving forward to Request for Proposal (RFP) participation. 

NGMPS Phase I Acquisition Schedule/Time Line:

It is envisioned that development and deployment of the NGMPS will be contracted for in phases.  Phase I will include a study, concept design, and simulation deliverable.  Simulation analysis is critical in demonstrating the potential USPS return on investment of the developed concept to substantially and positively impact USPS infrastructure in mail processing, transportation, logistic and delivery operations.   

Phase II is planned as an equipment build and component test phase, with participation planned for those suppliers, and their manufacturing source if applicable, who submitted concept designs and simulations which were considered by the Postal Service as best value in the ability of the design concept to meet operational needs.  Phase II will be divided into subsequent “equipment build” phases, which might include major component bread board, prototype, or pre-production phases depending upon the maturation level of the proposed solution.  

It is anticipated that the USPS will issue a Statement of Objectives (SOO) to pre-qualified sources in January 2009, and that contracts for Phase I as described would be awarded no later than April 2009.  A subsequent announcement prior to RFP issuance in January will identify all pre-qualified participants. 

This announcement of program initiation does not in any way commit the USPS to contract, test, or purchase any equipment or make any award as a result of this publication and notice.

Each Scraper shall have a Roll Over Protective Structure (ROPS) and a Falling Object Protective Structure (FOPS).  The Scraper will be a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) single-engine, heavy Scraper that will support missions requiring steep grades, high rolling resistance, and earthmoving operations. The Scraper will be capable of fully loading (push loading) its bowl. It is used for cutting, scraping, hauling, dumping, and spreading of earth during earthmoving operations.  The Scraper shall be the latest model of the standard product of the contractor and shall have demonstrated industry acceptability by having been manufactured, marketed, and sold i! n significant numbers to the commercial public for the same or similar application.  This effort is planned to be pursued as an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), 10 year requirements contract.Armor Requirements:The Scraper must be able to accept add-on armor and/or an interchangeable armored cab to the highest protection level possible without degradation to the vehicle's performance.  To eliminate unnecessary removal of components within the cab when interchanging an unarmored cab with an armored one, the floor of the cab shall be armored on all production Scrapers.  This armor will be called the A-kit.  In addition to the A-kit, two types of cab armor kits shall be available for each Scraper.  A B-kit shall consist of armor components/panels that are bolted on to the existing cab.  The hard-point/attachment point shall already be incorporated on to the unarmored cab.  A C-kit shall consist of an armored cab that is completely interchangeable with the unarmored cab.Transportability Requirements:The Scraper shall be transportable worldwide by rail, marine, and highway modes. It is an objective that the Scraper shall be air transportable by C-5 and C-17 aircraft. The vehicle operational weight shall not exceed 75,000 pounds with ROPS/FOPS cab, A-kit armoring, and 10% fuel.  Capability Requirements:The overall dimensions of the Scraper shall not exceed a width of 140 inches, a length of 550 inches, and a height of 150 inches.  The width of cut of the Scraper must be at least 114 inches, not to exceed 120 inches. The bowl shall have a minimum spread depth of 18 inches, with an objective of 24 inches. Ground clearance of the Scraper when fully loaded must be at least 18 inches, with an objective of 24 inches. The cutting edges must be replaceable, reversible and interchangeable. The Scraper, with full load, shall be capable of a forward travel speed of not less than 25 mph on level pavement, with 30 mph on level pavement as an objective.  The Scraper, without a load, shall travel at a forward speed of at least 30 mph on level pavement. The Scraper shall have a climate-controlled cab to facilitate operator comfort in climatic conditions "basic" and "hot".  Fuel capacity shall enable the Scraper to be operated continuously for at least 10 hours, with an objective of 12 hou! rs, without having to be refueled. Tow hooks or other suitable means of attaching a tow cable or tow bar will be provided on the front and rear of the Scraper.  The Scraper must be able to ford water up to a depth of 30 inches. At a minimum, the Scraper will have the capability to be safely operated without any wheel of the Scraper losing contact with the ground on a 35 percent side slope, empty; a 20 percent side slope, loaded; and a 40 percent longitudinal slope, loaded. Objective parameters are that the Scraper be capable of being safely operated on a 45 percent side slope empty, a 30 percent side slope, loaded, and a 50 percent longitudinal slope loaded. The Scraper must have the capability to be push loaded with the T-9 and D7G sized dozer in the Army and Marine Corps inventory respectively.  Military Unique Requirements:Other military unique requirements include the following:  24 volt starting capability, to include a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) slave receptacle; rifle mounting rack(s) inside the cab; lifting and tie-down provisions meeting Military Standard (MIL-STD)-209; blackout lights; and Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) paint.

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI)for theReplacement of the 621B ScraperThe Marine Corps System Command (MCSC) is issuing this RFI to survey the commercial market for a replacement of the 621B Scraper.  Vendors responding to this RFI should include information pertaining to the current Tier 3 engine requirements, as well as, their intent for implementation of the upcoming Tier 4 engine requirement. Each Scraper shall have a Roll Over Protective Structure (ROPS) and a Falling Object Protective Structure (FOPS).  The Scraper will be a Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) single-engine, heavy Scraper that will support missions requiring steep grades, high rolling resistance, and earthmoving operations. The Scraper will be capable of fully loading (push loading) its bowl. It is used for cutting, scraping, hauling, dumping, and spreading of earth during earthmoving operations.  The Scraper shall be the latest model of the standard product of the contractor and shall have demonstrated industry acceptability by having been manufactured, marketed, and sold i! n significant numbers to the commercial public for the same or similar application.  This effort is planned to be pursued as an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ), 10 year requirements contract.Armor Requirements:The Scraper must be able to accept add-on armor and/or an interchangeable armored cab to the highest protection level possible without degradation to the vehicle's performance.  To eliminate unnecessary removal of components within the cab when interchanging an unarmored cab with an armored one, the floor of the cab shall be armored on all production Scrapers.  This armor will be called the A-kit.  In addition to the A-kit, two types of cab armor kits shall be available for each Scraper.  A B-kit shall consist of armor components/panels that are bolted on to the existing cab.  The hard-point/attachment point shall already be incorporated on to the unarmored cab.  A C-kit shall consist of an armored cab that is completely interchangeable with the unarmored cab.Transportability Requirements:The Scraper shall be transportable worldwide by rail, marine, and highway modes. It is an objective that the Scraper shall be air transportable by C-5 and C-17 aircraft. The vehicle operational weight shall not exceed 75,000 pounds with ROPS/FOPS cab, A-kit armoring, and 10% fuel.  Capability Requirements:The overall dimensions of the Scraper shall not exceed a width of 140 inches, a length of 550 inches, and a height of 150 inches.  The width of cut of the Scraper must be at least 114 inches, not to exceed 120 inches. The bowl shall have a minimum spread depth of 18 inches, with an objective of 24 inches. Ground clearance of the Scraper when fully loaded must be at least 18 inches, with an objective of 24 inches. The cutting edges must be replaceable, reversible and interchangeable. The Scraper, with full load, shall be capable of a forward travel speed of not less than 25 mph on level pavement, with 30 mph on level pavement as an objective.  The Scraper, without a load, shall travel at a forward speed of at least 30 mph on level pavement. The Scraper shall have a climate-controlled cab to facilitate operator comfort in climatic conditions "basic" and "hot".  Fuel capacity shall enable the Scraper to be operated continuously for at least 10 hours, with an objective of 12 hou! rs, without having to be refueled. Tow hooks or other suitable means of attaching a tow cable or tow bar will be provided on the front and rear of the Scraper.  The Scraper must be able to ford water up to a depth of 30 inches. At a minimum, the Scraper will have the capability to be safely operated without any wheel of the Scraper losing contact with the ground on a 35 percent side slope, empty; a 20 percent side slope, loaded; and a 40 percent longitudinal slope, loaded. Objective parameters are that the Scraper be capable of being safely operated on a 45 percent side slope empty, a 30 percent side slope, loaded, and a 50 percent longitudinal slope loaded. The Scraper must have the capability to be push loaded with the T-9 and D7G sized dozer in the Army and Marine Corps inventory respectively.  Military Unique Requirements:Other military unique requirements include the following:  24 volt starting capability, to include a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) slave receptacle; rifle mounting rack(s) inside the cab; lifting and tie-down provisions meeting Military Standard (MIL-STD)-209; blackout lights; and Chemical Agent Resistant Coating (CARC) paint. The vendor is to provide worldwide customer service capabilities and an 18 month commercial warranty and a 60 month commercial warranty.Firms possessing the capability to accomplish this requirement are invited to submit a statement of qualification, enclose product literature, past performance information, current General Services Administration (GSA) or other schedule information (if applicable) and price schedules or catalogues. This Request for Information (RFI) is for planning purposes only. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI, or otherwise pay for the information requested.  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of submission of responses to this RFI and Government use of such information.  The Government recognizes that proprietary data may be part of this effort. If so included, clearly mark such restricted or proprietary data and present it as an addendum to the non-restricted/non-proprietary information.Responses to this RFI shall be mailed to Marine Corps Systems Command, Attn: William M.

<DESC>It is imperative that a sole source award be extended to Emerson Network Power, Liebert Services Incorporated for preventative and emergency maintenance of the UPS and HVAC units on the attached document. 

This sole source award was initiated to ensure coverage and support for Liebert certified engineers to provide the Liebert pre-packaged Essential Service Plan for the Liebert Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) and Liebert High-Volume Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment listed in the attached document.  This equipment is located in building 1 at DFAS Indianapolis (DFAS-IN) in the Emmett J Bean Federal Building, 8899 East 56th Street, Indianapolis, IN 46249.

The Liebert pre-packaged Essential Service plan includes the following: 
Emergency Service: Guaranteed 4-hour response 24 hours/day, 7 days/week that includes service labor and travel charge.
Parts Coverage as noted in the Liebert Maintenance Agreement
Preventative Maintenance Visits scheduled Monday – Friday, 8 am to 5 pm (two visits are included for the UPS units annually and four visits’ are included for the HVAC units annually)

The table in the attachment lists the current equipment that is to be maintained and serviced during the term of the contract.

The period of performance is 12 months from date of contract award, with four 12 month option periods.

Emerson Network Power, Liebert Services Inc. is the only source that is able to provide the Liebert Essential pre-packaged service program to provide the preventative maintenance and emergency service needed to maintain the UPS and HVAC units listed in the attachment.  The Essential pre-packaged service program is not available from any other source or vendor.  The equipment is currently in the second year of its expected life of 20 years if maintained properly.  The essential pre-packaged service was previously supplied by Liebert through the standard commercial warranty obtained when the equipment was purchased.

The Essential pre-packaged preventative maintenance and emergency service is only available from a Liebert Global Services’ Service Center.  The preventative maintenance and emergency service is performed by a Certified Liebert factory trained Customer Engineer.  Currently Emerson Network Power, Liebert Services Inc. is the only provider of the Essential pre-packaged service program and Certified Liebert Customer Engineers for the sales and service territory that covers DFAS-IN in Indianapolis, IN.  In order to maintain the operational and functional aspects of the Liebert equipment and meet the operational requirements of DFAS-IN, the equipment listed above in paragraph 3 needs to be maintained and serviced by a certified Liebert Customer Engineer that has received training from the Liebert Corporation Learning Center.  Liebert Customer Engineers receive annual training to keep abreast of new maintenance techniques.  Additionally Liebert Customer Engineers have access to Liebert Online that provides the latest maintenance techniques and firmware for the UPS and HVAC units listed in paragraph 3 above.  The firmware that is provided by the Liebert Customer Engineer is unique to Liebert Corporation and only available through Liebert Global Services’ Service Centers.  These firmwares updates are provided by Liebert Corporation to the Liebert Customer Engineers are integral to maintaining the UPS and HVAC units.  The firmware updates provide the necessary updates to the hardware and software already owned by DFAS, in order to ensure peak efficiency of the UPS and HVAC systems.  Without these firmware upgrades, the estimated life span of the UPS and HVAC units is drastically shortened, as these units will not be operating at their peak efficiency and would put the Government at a high probability for failure of these units. Preventative Maintenance and Emergency Service provided by a non-Liebert Customer Engineer has the potential to cause undue harm to the Government.  A non-Liebert Customer Engineer will not have access to the latest maintenance techniques and firmware to maintain the equipment.  A non-Liebert Customer Engineer may not have the knowledge of the Liebert UPS and HVAC units and how they operate in their current environment to meet the Government’s mission and requirements.  

Market research has determined that the only source able to provide the required services is Emerson Network Power, Liebert Services Incorporated.  Liebert Services Incorporated has a network of established sales and service territories that provide Liebert Global Services.  Sales and Service of Liebert equipment is handle by the authorized company within that territory.  The territory that covers DFAS-IN is handled by Emerson Network Power, Liebert Services Inc., through Fuller Engineering, Inc., who is the only authorized Liebert Global Services’ Service Center for the Indianapolis, IN territory to maintain and service Liebert equipment.

Notwithstanding the Government’s intent to negotiate this requirement on a single source basis under the authority of 41 USC 253 (1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, all responsible sources may submit a statement of technical capabilities which shall be considered by the agency.  Information submitted in response to this notice must be in sufficient detail to permit agency analysis to establish a bona fide capability to meet the requirement.  Responses to this notice may be submitted via email to cheryl.coxen@nist.gov, no later than 12:00 noon, November 28, 2008, Eastern Standard Time or fax to 301-975-3839.

<DESC>There is a need to assess the maturity of existing autonomous precision 120mmmortar cartridges to meet current warfighting requirements against targets thatdo not present standard target signatures. The need calls for a delivery accuracy of less than 5-meter Circular Error Probability (CEP) objective and 10-meter CEP threshold. 
In order to assess the industry state-of-the-art 120mm mortar precisioncapability, the U.S. Army Armament Research, Development & Engineering Center (ARDEC), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, is seeking white papers from theindustry by December 19, 2008 describing their 120mm mortar precisioncapabilities and how their design would be applicable as a Common GuidanceControl Module.
ARDEC is also seeking industry partners, through the formation of CRADAs, to bring industry state-of-the-art 120mm mortar precision designs to a successfulguide-to-target demonstration in March 2009. 
This demonstration is in addition to the 120mm mortar/105mm artillery demonstration in September 2009, which is discussed in Special Notices W15QKN-09-Z-0304 and W15QKN-09-Z-0305, and does not preclude industry from participating in the 120mm mortar portion of that demonstration. Partiesinterested in participating in both demonstrations must provide a different design for each demonstration. 
White Paper Requirements:In addition to describing their 120mm precision mortar capabilities and how the design would be applicable as a Common Guidance Control Module, interestedparties are requested to include in their white papers a description of their:technology readiness level, ability to meet the demonstrations timeline, anyspecial testing considerations, substantiation for predicted accuracy, predicted maximum and minimum effective range, fire control interface requiredfor operations, overall length and weight, lethality versus troops in the openand lightly armored vehicles, and ability to complete qualification of theguided cartridge in 12 months. White papers shall also include a cost estimateto complete qualification of the guided cartridge in 12 months, and estimatesof unit production cost based on ranges of: 1,000  2,000 cartridges inProduction Year 1 (PY1); 2,000  3,000 in PY2; and 2,000  3,000 in PY3. WhitePapers are requested no later than COB on December 19, 2008.
CRADA:White paper submission does not guarantee the formation of the CRADA. ARDECplans to enter CRADA partnerships only with industry partners that are bestsuited to accomplish the stated operational need objectives. All parties thathave submitted white papers will be notified by January 16, 2009 of ARDECsdecision to initiate a CRADA for demonstration of their design.  If chosen,industry partners will meet with ARDEC after January 16, 2009 to discuss theCRADA and demonstration details.  CRADAs are expected to be signed no laterthan February 15, 2009.
Safety Assessment Report:It is important to note that industry partners anticipating participation inthe March 2009 demonstration must furnish a Safety Assessment Report on thetest munition by the time of signing of the CRADA agreement.
Guide-to-Target Demonstration:A demonstration to assess the state-of-the-art 120mm mortar precisioncapability will be scheduled in late March 2009 and will focus on a gunlaunched, inert, autonomous, precision 120mm mortar. For the 120mm mortardemonstration, ARDEC can furnish weapon system information, a test site, a test weapon, test instrumentation, and data gathering support, but industrymust provide munition test assets.  It is anticipated that 7 to 10 test roundswill be needed for the demonstration, and firings will be done with Ambient(+70F), Hot (+125F) and Cold (-25F) conditioned cartridges. A US weapon(dismounted 120mm smooth bore mortar system) will be used for the guide-to-target demonstration.  
Interested parties shall identify and mark within their white paper submissionany information that is considered proprietary. The suggested page limit forthe submissions is 25 pages (8 x 11 inches) paper hard copies or electronic format equivalent.  Font size shall be 12, single spaced, with one inch borders. Submission with more than 25 pages can be accepted. The Governmentreserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any private sector input inresponse to this special notice.

(ix)  The provision at FAR 52.212-2, titled, "Evaluation of Commercial Items" (JAN 1999), is applicable to this acquisition.  

The following factors shall be used to evaluate quotes and are listed in descending order of importance:

TECHNICAL UNDERSTANDING:
To determine technical merit, each quotation will be evaluated against the requirements listed in this solicitation and in the attached SOW. All vendors offering an "Equal To" product must provide supporting documentation that their product can meet the requirements listed in the solicitation and the attached SOW.  1)  The proposals will be graded subjectively with final scores of, “Acceptable”, or “Unacceptable”.  A score of “Acceptable” would mean that the proposed product fully met the requirements.  An “Unacceptable” score means that the offer will not be considered for award.

PRICE:
FDA will award a purchase order to a responsible vendor whose quote is the lowest price meeting or exceeding the requirements.

PAST PERFORMANCE: 
Vendors should provide two references of similar efforts performed during the last three years. This will include a description of the project, project title, contract number, contract amount, client identification including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official name(s), address and telephone number. The government is seeking to determine whether an offeror has consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to customer satisfaction and high performance of services.  This is a matter of judgment.

Performance risks are those associated with an offeror’s likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror’s past performance record.  Rating of positive, neutral, and poor will be given.  A positive past performance will take precedence over neutral or poor past performance.  Neutral past performance takes precedence over poor past performance.  A contractor with no past performance will be given a score of neutral, which will neither be used to the advantage nor disadvantage of the offeror. The Government will assess the relative risks associated with each offeror.  Performance risks are those associated with an offeror’s likelihood of success in performing the acquisition requirements as indicated by that offeror’s record of past performance.

 NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester’s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency’s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: 

Department of Homeland Security

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

USAID’s Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) is seeking highly motivated, highly qualified individuals who want the opportunity to help support rapid international transition programs for priority conflict-prone countries. Created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID, OTI helps local, indigenous partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries by providing fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief. Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous local partners such as civil society groups (non-governmental organizations or informal community groups), local governments, private businesses, media groups, and others, through identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public understanding and participation in their country’s political process.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs). These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the office’s programmatic goals and objectives.  


For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

The OTI Regional Advisor position was developed because  (1) USAID’s portfolio of countries facing various forms of fragility or crisis has increased, making OTI’s experience and skills that much more relevant, timely and sought after; (2) the Transformational Diplomacy strategy has placed new, growing, and immediate regional demands on USAID in the region, including increased engagement in conflict, crisis and transitional assistance programming, which in turn has increased demand for OTI’s assistance and advice; and (3) as USAID’s lead operational unit for crisis intervention programming, OTI is evolving to carry out more assessments, provide more experientially based technical advice and analysis, and explore earlier countries that face possible political crises in order to deepen understanding, identify opportunities and constraints and to be more prepared to execute programming when necessary.  

OBJECTIVE

To hire an OTI Regional Advisor.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

The OTI Regional Advisor will serve as a liaison between the Office of Transition Initiatives and a wide array of individuals and institutions (USAID Field Missions, the Regional Development Mission / Asia (RDMA), regionally based officials from the State Department, the Department of Defense, and other agencies of the U.S. Government, international organizations, and the non-government community abroad).  The OTI Regional Advisor will visit, as necessary, ongoing OTI programs in the region  as well as proposed and potential country program sites, will generally serve as OTI’s senior official in the region, and may be used in other regions (not to exceed 30 working days per visit) when appropriate as requested by the relevant Regional Team Leader.

ATTACHMENT 1

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. “MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES.”

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer’s liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled “Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation.”  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor’s invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual’s behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

<DESC><p>ALL FURTHER DOCUMENTATION WILL NEED TO REFLECT SOLICITATION NUMBER FA3002-09-R-0027.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS FOR ECAC AND ASBC EXPEDITIONARY SKILLS TRAINING 1. The Air Education and Training Command (AETC), Randolph Air Force Base (AFB), Texas, is soliciting interest and capability statements for a competitive acquisition for conducting AETC Course S-V88-AMM, Evasion and Conduct After Capture and providing expeditionary skills training for Air University&rsquo;s Air and Space Basic Course at Maxwell AFB, AL. 2. Course S-V88-AMM&rsquo;s mission is to ensure each student graduates with confidence and ability to employ evasion and conduct after capture tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP&rsquo;s) necessary to return with honor regardless of the circumstances of isolation. Students are Air Force 2nd Lieutenants who are not fliers or special operations personnel. 3. S-V88-AMM, ECAC, is four days long. The course consists of classroom, laboratory and operational training on Maxwell AFB. The annual schedule will consist of 20 classes of approximately 180 students per class and is taught the week immediately proceeding and the week immediately following ASBC classes. 4. The contractor will provide conduct after capture instruction in academic, laboratory, academic role play laboratory and resistance training laboratory environments; evasion operational training; and course administrative and logistical support services. Student instructor ratios for ECAC training are 20:1 for academic, laboratory, and academic role play laboratory training; 15:3 for resistance training laboratory training; and 11:1 for evasion operational training. 5. The mission of the Air and Space Basic Course (ASBC) is to inspire new USAF officers to comprehend their roles as Airmen who understand and live by USAF core values, can articulate and advocate what Air, Space, and Cyberspace power brings to the fight, and are dedicated as warriors in the world&rsquo;s most respected Air, Space, and Cyberspace Force. ASBC is conducted by Air University (AU); the overall course length is six weeks, and AU conducts ten classes per year. 6. The contractor will be responsible for providing subject matter expertise on subjects to include: formal lecture and demonstration/ performance instruction in Air Force Combative Program, day and night land navigation, night operations, air base defense, personnel handling, enemy prisoner of war (EPW) &amp; third country national (TCN), tactical communication procedures, small unit tactics, combat arms training and course support services. 7. The contractor will be required to execute and evaluate scenario based challenges for the skills taught during week one of ASBC. Contractor personnel will act as opposition forces and evaluator/trainers during scenarios. 8. The contractor will during ECAC and ASBC down days be required to support other AU courses. 9. The contractor and all personnel employed by the contractor at Maxwell AFB must possess a SECRET security clearance. 10. The purpose of publicizing notices for potential actions is to increase competition, to broaden industry participation in meeting Government requirements, and to assist small businesses in general in obtaining contracts and subcontracts. This is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but instead is a market research tool to determine the availability and adequacy of potential sources prior to issuing the RFP. This is a SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 611710 applies. Firms responding to this announcement should indicate their business size for code 611710, particularly if they are a small business (the small business size standard is $6.5 million). &ldquo;Small business&rdquo; means small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZ one small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business. If business size is transitioning to other than &ldquo;small business&rdquo; in the next 90 days, please indicate as such. 11. This sources sought notice is for planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. It is not the intention of the Government to enter into a contract based on this notice or to otherwise pay for information solicited. If the Government decides to contract for this effort at a later date, we will issue an RFP to industry for a performance period of 6 years. The anticipated award date is October 2009. 12. AETC Contracting will host an industry day at Maxwell AFB on 13 November 2008. The time and place will be specified at a later date. 13. It is the Government&rsquo;s intent to award one contract. The Government currently plans to issue an unrestricted solicitation; however, it reserves the right to make this a small business (SB) set-aside based on the interest and technical capabilities received from SB concerns. (Under an unrestricted solicitation, large businesses will be required to submit a subcontracting plan.) Therefore, it is requested that SB concerns provide sufficient written information supporting their capability to perform (items H - N below). 14. All interested parties are invited to provide the following information for your company/institution and for any teaming or joint venture partners: A. Company/Institute Name and CAGE code. B. Mailing Address. C. Point of Contact (to include phone/fax and e-mail). D. Web site, if applicable. E. State if your company is registered under NAICS code 611710 or not. F.

Degree of experience conducting evasion and conduct after capture and expeditionary skills training. I.

J. Ability to field 25% of personnel who are graduates of AETC course, S-V81-A SERE Specialist Training and 50% of total personnel who have a minimum of two years experience instructing at a Level-C Code of Conduct course or other suitable SERE related experience.

Ability to field expeditionary skills instructors (as described in paras 6 &ndash; 8 above) who can also be trained to conduct ECAC training. N.

4 March 2008
Urgent Information concerning the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program (ATEP)follows:   Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) is not recognizing ATEP'ssolicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2560. Consequently, the 29 Feb 08 PIXS post toATEP did not post on FBO under said solicitation number. After numerous attemptsby PIXS and FBO administrators to resolve the issue, both concluded the onlysolution is to reissue ATEP information under a new solicitation number.Therefore to ensure you receive any and all updates to the ATEP, you must register/re-register under the new solicitation number of FA8633-08-R-2599. The name of theprogram has not changed, it is still the Advanced Technical Exploitation Program(ATEP).

<DESC>The Department of Justice intends to issue a request for proposal for on-site and telephonic language interpreter services in support of the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).  EOIR administers and interprets Federal immigration laws and regulations through the conduct of immigration court proceedings, appellate reviews, and administrative hearings in individual cases.  EOIR carries out these responsibilities through its three main components: (1) The Office of the Chief Immigration Judge (OCIJ), which oversees all the Immigration Courts and their proceedings; (2) The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which hears appeals of decisions made in individual cases by Immigration Judges, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) District Directors, or other immigration officials; and, (3) The Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer (OCAHO), which resolves cases concerning employer sanctions, document fraud, and immigration-related employment discrimination.  EOIR currently has 104 staff interpreter positions (primarily Spanish).  EOIR will rely on contract interpreter services to augment the in-house staff and to provide interpreters for matters involving other languages.  These services will be required for immigration court proceedings on an as needed basis throughout the fifty United States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories including, but not limited to, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam.   It is anticipated that a single contract for language interpreter services will be awarded with a period of performance of one (1) base year and five (5) option periods of one year each.  The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541930, Translation and Interpretation Services, with a size standard of $6.5 million.  Due date for receipt of proposals will be January 15, 2009.  All information regarding this procurement, including the solicitation document and amendments, will only be made available electronically on the General Service Administration’s “Federal Business Opportunities” web site, http://www.fedbizopps.gov.

<DESC>The purpose of this notice is to provide Industry with the official Missile Defense Agency (MDA) "OCI Policy Statement" for the MiDAESS acquisition strategy.  (Policy is contained in attachment to this notice.)

The RFPs would be released simultaneously with separate multiple awards for functional groups.

<DESC>THIS CHANGE EXTENDS THE SUBMISSION DATE OF PROPOSALS TO NAVAIR TO 30 DECEMBER 2008.

THIS CHANGE DELETES THE REQUIREMENT FOR A CONFIDENTIAL CLEARANCE TO OBTAIN CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EFFORT.

The Naval Air Systems Command Conventional Strike Weapons Program Office (PMA-201) intends to procure on a Best Value competitive basis a low cost replacement Container for the All-Up-Round (AUR) Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW).  This solicitation has an estimated annual production rate of between 300 and 650 containers per year.  Offerors will be required to be qualified in accordance with the First Article Test provided in JSOW AUR Container Performance Specification PMA201-08-001 and Statement of Work for the Container for the JSOW System AGM-154.

A Small Business Set-Aside competition will be conducted using the BEST VALUE Source Selection approach to select the most advantageous offer based on both non-price factors as well as price factor.  The Government anticipates evaluating the offers based on technical, price related factors and past performance.  The Government anticipates award in May 2009 for a firm fixed price contract with a base and four (04) options.  The estimated contract value, including all options, is valued to be $22,000,000.00.  The Government shall require any potential offeror to have an approved First Article completed eighteen (18) months after contract award.  

Companies must officially request classified documents through LaTonya Bembry at: latonya.bembry@navy.mil.  This request must include the potential offerors company name, mailing address, current security authorization, point of contact, phone number and CAGE code.  

The Final RFP may be obtained at the following website:  http://www.navair.navy.mil under “Business Opportunities” under N00019-08-R-0029 on or about 22 September 2008.  Except as noted here, the Government will only release the solicitation/RFP, including any subsequent amendments, over the Internet.   No telephone requests for the solicitation will be accepted, no written requests will be accepted and no hard copies will be mailed.  After the solicitation release, vendors should regularly access the website to ensure they have all amendments.  All proposals will be due by 3:00PM Eastern Standard Time on 15 December 2008.  

This program includes information that has been designated as “Distribution D” and is only releasable to current and approved Department of Defense (DoD) contractors.  In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms.  Some documents are under Federal export control for “sensitive” or “controlled” technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of State’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security.  Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.  As such, the documents contain data whose export/transfer/disclosure is restricted by U.S. law and dissemination to non-U.S. persons whether in the United States or abroad requires an export license or other authorization.

Disclosure of the control drawings requires the verification of a current license for the oral, visual or documentary disclosure of technical data by U.S. persons to foreign persons as defined under by the U.S. Department of State website.  http://pmdtc.org/licenses.htm.

To participate in this program, a foreign firm may be required to team with a U.S. firm that possesses a current and valid U.S. facility clearance with technologies/data safeguarding capabilities, inclusive of the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program.  Any resultant contractor teaming or license agreements between U.S. firms and foreign firms, to include employment of foreign nationals by U.S. firms, shall be in accordance with current U.S. export laws, security requirements, and National Disclosure Policy and shall require the prior approval of the contracting officer and foreign disclosure officer.  It is the contractor’s responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents.

As such, Attachment (1) Statement of Work for the Container for the JSOW System AGM-154; and Attachment (2) JSOW AUR Container Performance Specification PMA201-08-001 will NOT be posted with the RFP and must be obtained through this office.  

Interested Firms should request a copy of the Technical Data Package through LaTonya Bembry at: latonya.bembry@navy.mil or Tracy Medford at: tracy.medford@navy.mil.  To obtain a copy of these attachments, the written request must be submitted to this office and must include the name of your company, mailing address, phone number, email address (if available), current CAGE number, Central Contractor Registration number and acknowledgement of the contractor’s responsibility under the U.S. export contract laws and regulations.  For any foreign firm, the request must include proof of a current and applicable approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act if applicable.   

Prior to release of any control document under this solicitation, any U.S. contractor must acknowledge its responsibilities under U.S. export control laws and regulations (including the obligation, under certain circumstances, to obtain an export license prior to the release of technical data within or outside the United States) and agree that it will not disseminate any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations. It is the responsibility of the contractor to provide this certification and/or proof of a current approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.   Upon verification of your status and acknowledgement, the requested documents will be provided.  

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  Registration in the DOD Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database will be a prerequisite for receiving an award.  For more information on the CCR, refer to the CCR website at http://www.ccr.gov/index.cfm.

<DESC>The purpose of this Request for Proposal (RFP) is to enter into a contract for domestic manufacturing to support advanced development of next generation portable ventilators with accessory components at a cost of <$2000/fully kitted unit that will advance the technology to meet the needs for an expected overwhelming number of respiratory infectious disease patients during a pandemic influenza outbreak or in an all-hazards (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN))event in which mass casualties may be expected.  Characteristics recommended for the new technology should include the following: a basic volume flow-control; a filtration device to protect against exposure during a CBRN event; light weight battery with extended battery life exceeding the current industry standard of 4-12 hours with a rechargeable battery that is capable of recharging within 2-4 hours;  flexibility to accommodate a wide patient population from neonate to adult; intuitive user interface for ease of use in a clinical setting so that inexperienced health care providers with no respiratory support training could safely and easily use the device; small, lighter weight than current portable ventilators and easily transportable to clinical sites and for storage  in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS); a closed-loop inspiratory pressure control system that can operate with minimal time and attention from staff; accommodate a universal breathing circuit and connectors; adequate shielding for radio frequency interference (RFI), electromagnetic interference (EMI), and conductive interference; software must be easily upgradeable to the state-of-the-art to extend the product life-cycle; real time monitoring of O2 saturation, CO2, and respiratory rate; stable shelf life and ease of maintenance for stockpiling and use; recognizable and operational audible and visible alarm system; and should accommodate a heat and moisture exchanger  (HME) or a humidifier and a pulse oximeter.  
  
The Offeror must be able to ramp up production in an emergency to supply at least 1700 fully kitted ventilators in one month to meet a capability goal of at least 10,000 fully kitted units within 6 months.  All aspects of manufacturing and distributing capabilities for the ventilator and subcomponent parts/accessories shall be compliant with FDA Quality System Regulation requirements and must meet all applicable American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards for ventilators.  The outcome of the contract is to develop a domestically manufactured next generation portable ventilator that has FDA premarket clearance.

The anticipated period of performance will be two years or 24 months.  Additional details and requirements will be described in the solicitation.  RFP-HHS-BARDA-08-20 will be available electronically through FedBizOpps on or about December 12, 2008.  Proposals will be due a minimum of 45 days after RFP issuance.

<DESC><p>1) CONTRACT INFORMATION: This contract(s) is being procured in accordance with the Brooks A-E Act as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. Firms will be selected for negotiation based on demonstrated competence and qualifications for the required work. A-E services are required for an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract to provide for the primary disciplines of Structural, Civil, Geotechnical, Hydraulic, Mechanical and Electrical engineering (each of equal priority); additional disciplines are Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Cost Engineering and Specification Writing. It is anticipated that this contract will be awarded by June 2009. This announcement may result in multiple awards and is open to all businesses regardless of size. If concurrent multiple contract awards are made, task orders will be allocated based upon the Contracting Officer's determination of the special qualifications of the firms; the nature of the work involved in the task order; and the immediacy of the work and availability of the firm. Distribution of the work will be a secondary consideration. In the final selection process, the most highly qualified firms may be interviewed. All interested A -E firms are reminded that, in accordance with the provisions of PL 95-507, they will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent, consistent with the efficient performance of the contract, with small and small disadvantaged firms. If a large business is selected for this contract, it must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. The target subcontracting goals for this contract are as follows: a minimum of 23% of the contractors intended subcontract amount be placed with small businesses, 5% be placed with small disadvantaged businesses, 5% be placed with women-owned small businesses, 3.1% be placed with HUB Zone small business, and 1.5% be placed with Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business. Large business firms that intend to do any subcontracting must convey their intent to meet the minimum goals on the SF330. If a large business firm is selected for this contract, it will be required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiations. If the selected firm intends to submit a plan with lesser goals, it must submit written rationale in the plan as to why the above goals cannot be met. The North American Industry Classification System code for this action is 541330 and the small business size standard is $4 million in average annual receipts. This contract will have a base period not to exceed one year and four one-year option periods, for a total IDIQ value not to exceed $12,000,000. The Contractor is guaranteed no less than $48,000 the first year and $24,000 for the option periods, if exercised. Work under this contract is subject to satisfactory negotiation of individual task orders. Work will be ordered by negotiated firm-fixed price task orders. The District may award in the future IDIQ contracts to perform work that may also be encompassed by this announcement; the Contracting Officer will consider the following factors in deciding which contractor will be selected to negotiate an order: Performance, capacity to accomplish the task order in the required time, specialized experience, professional qualifications and knowledge of the region. If more than one firm is selected, the top ranked firm will be awarded the first contract, the second ranked firm will be awarded the second contract, and so on. If necessary, secondary selection criteria will be used as a tie breaker between firms considered as technically equal. The wages and benefits of service employees (see FAR 22.10) performing under this contract must be at least equal to those determined by the Department of Labor under the Service Contract Act. As determined by the employees office location (not the location of the work). Rates will be negotiated for each 12-month period of the contract at the time of the original award.<br /><br />2.
