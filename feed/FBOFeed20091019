Background
 In summary, this includes a through description of the Unclassified Organizational Server that makes force structure data available for integration and use by other programs of record that use force structure data, and all the Architectural Views of GFM. Procedurally speaking, the Unclassified Org Server data is passed to the Classified Organizational Servers and augments the classified force structure data that includes the Combatant Commander (COCOM) command relationships used to document the force assignment process. The force structure data includes specifications and authorizations for personnel and equipment as well as unit identification data. Additional pertinent background information for this task is provided at Attachment 1, GFM Capability Development Document and information abounds at the Joint URL https://www.intelink.gov/wiki/Global_Force_Management_Data_Initiative/CCB#Operational_Baseline_v1.1. Technical Specifications, Operational Baselines, Overviews, CONOPS, and Implementation Plans can be found there.
1.  System Overview
The Air Force Global Force Management Data Initiative (GFM DI), enables Defense Readiness Reporting System/Global Visibility Capability, Adaptive Planning, Defense Integrated Military Human Resource System, and Standard Financial Information Structure to integrate organizational and force structure data across the Department of Defense. The end goal of the GFM DI is to integrate the three force management processes (assignment, allocation and apportionment), and ensure the data is available to meet the needs of all users, systems and functions.  This task is the sustainment, maintenance and modification of the current classified and unclassified AF GFM DI that includes implementation of the Global Force Management Information Exchange Data Model, (GFMIEDM), 3.5 changes. The Global Force Management Information Exchange Data Model (GFMIEDM) is the information exchange specification that supports data integration within and among the Services' Organizational Servers (each branc! h of the Service has an Organizational Server), and provides information to external systems. Further, to enable data integration and de-confliction across the Org Servers, and provide utility for applications outside the Org Servers, the tagging of all authorized force structure data with unambiguous, unique identifiers is a necessity. Force Management Identifiers (FMIDS), serve this function for all data within the GFMIEDM, and thus all data within the Org Servers (including organizations, materiel authorizations, personnel authorizations, and relationships and associations between these entities). The GFMIEDM version 3.5 contains 46 different entities that cover the minimum essential force structure data understood as necessary to fulfill Global Force Management. The inter-relational generalized hierarchy of the data specification provides for the unique identification of all GFMIEDM data with a set of FMIDS comprising twelve attributes. Note:  GFMIEDM found at the URL h! ttps://www.intelink.gov/wiki/Global_Force_Management_Data_Initiative/CCB#Operational_Baseline_v1.1.

RECOVERY - This procurement is being funded via the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).
This notice is provided for informational purposes only.  This opportunity is available only to contractors under GSA Schedule, SIN No. 899-1 - Environmental Planning Services and Documentation.
Reclamation has a need for an economic study focused on obtaining information regarding non-use values involving Klamath Hydroelectric Project dam removal.  Non-use value is the value attached to environmental changes associated with dam removal by members of the public who do not consume Klamath fish or visit the Klamath Basin.  Non-use values, by definition, cannot be inferred from observed behavior but must be estimated using stated preference methods.  
The principal components of this project are to design and implement a non-use valuation survey of the U.S. public that addresses the incremental environmental improvements of dam removal relative to volitional fish passage, and to analyze the survey data in a manner that contributes to the broader economic analysis. An important aspect of survey development is providing a plausible and understandable valuation scenario.

<CONTACT>Princess Cannon, 202-493-4634

<a href="mailto:princess.cannon@faa.gov">princess.cannon@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>This Amendment incorporates NAIC code 334210 which was omitted on the original Market Survey.  Consequently, FAA has extended the response date for the Market Survey until October 23, 2009.
Background: The System Wide Information Management Program (SWIM) will use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles in designing and specifying NAS Air Traffic Management (ATM) services.  The FAA is seeking an XML Gateway that meets the Government's requirements to help ensure that the opportunities and benefits of SOA are achieved. 
Purpose:This is a market survey for the SWIM XML Gateway Qualified Vendor's List. This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set-aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested business concerns, including SBA certified 8(a) firms and other small business concerns, capable of providing standard, commercial XML Gateways which meets the Government's requirements. 
Furthermore, this survey will aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, and other small businesses such as Women Owned businesses and Service Disabled Veteran businesses or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. 
Requirements:In order to make the determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses the FAA requires a Capability Statement from interested vendors. The Capability Statement should address your firm's technical capability to provide the product and services described in the Requirements Document. Limited to three (4) pages, it should include the following:1.	A list of similar projects undertaken.  For each project cited, please provide the following information: Name of project, Contract number, Customer Name, Brief Description of project or services/XML Gateway product provided, start and end dates, and any other relevant information.2.	Expected programmatic approach, i.e., in-house, teaming, or subcontracting. If your organization is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, please provide the percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  3.	If applicable, a list of all teaming partners with a description of each partner's responsibility. 4.	Business Declaration Form (see attachment).5.	If applicable, Small Business or 8(a) certification letter.
To help you determine if your company is qualified to provide XML Gateway and services necessary for this requirement, the FAA is making available a DRAFT Requirements Document and Qualification Information Request (QIR). The Government welcomes substantive comments on both documents. Please submit comments together with the Capability Statement described above. There is no page limit on comments.  
Contact Information:The FAA prefers that all responses, questions, and/or comments, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following address:  princess.cannon@faa.gov.  All responses to this market survey must be received no later than October 23, 2009, 12:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. 
Princess Cannon, Contract SpecialistEmail: princess.cannon@faa.govPhone: 202.493.4634
Follow-up Activity (if any):Note:  The final Requirements Document and QIR are expected to be posted to the FAA Contract Opportunities Website on November 2, 2009 with a response date of November 23, 2009.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC><p>This is a Notice of Intent by the General Services Administration to solicit a modified full service lease (tenant shall pay for electrical consumption) for warehouse and office space. The Federal Government has a requirement to lease approximately 161,705 BOMA rentable square feet for the National Archives Records Administration (NARA) of Denver, Colorado. The proposed building must yield approximately 34,705 BOMA useable square feet of office space and 127,000 BOMA useable square feet of contiguous warehouse space. The site shall be able to accommodate 100 on-site parking spaces available for visitors, handicap and employees. Lease shall be full service and below prospectus threshold with a maximum term up to twenty (20) years.</p>
<p>The delineated area of consideration is as follows:</p>
<p>North - State Hwy 14/Cty Rd 82 (Weld County)<br />West - Federal Hwy 287 (Fort Collins) to Wadsworth Pkwy/Blvd (Denver) to 6th Avenue then west to C-470<br />South - 6th Avenue (Denver) west to Wadsworth Pkwy/Blvd then South to Alameda Avenue/Pkwy then west to C-470<br />East - County Rd 43 (Weld County) to I-76 to E-470 to 6th Avenue</p>
<p>GSA is interested in considering sites for new construction or existing facilities that meet the following minimum requirements. The proposed location must be currently zoned for the intended use, building infrastructure (water, sewer, utilities) to the proposed site must be in-place or readily available, and the site must have paved access to major highways. Proximity to area cultural and education institutions is desirable. The proposed building requires a 100 foot setback from parking areas and roads. The proposed site to accommodate the facility could range from 12 to 17 acres and must be secured by a fence.</p>
<p>The proposed facility must comply with fire safety, security, and other records protection requirements as stated in 36 CFR 1228 Subpart , available at:<br />http://www.archives.gov/about/regulations/part-1228/k.html .</p>
<p>WAREHOUSE/RECORDS SPACE - The warehouse facility shall consist of five (5) records storage bays (approximately 127,000 usable square feet) consisting of two (2) temporary records bays at 42,000 square feet, one (1) temporary records storage bay at 17,000 square feet, one (1) permanent records storage bay at 12,500 square feet, and one (1) archival storage bay at 13,500 square feet. ALL storage bays must meet the Federal records storage requirements outlined in 36 CFR 1228 Subpart K. In addition, the permanent bay will require office-type air conditioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The archival storage bay must meet the NARA 1571 standard for archival space, which details archival requirements for temperature, humidity, air filtration, fire safety, finishes, lighting, etc. available at:<br />http://www.archives.gov/foia/directives/nara1571.pdf.</p>
<p><br />Offerors are specifically placed on notice that requirements for some building elements exceed the normal "warehouse" standards. The Office of Regional Records Services, the Space and Security Division, and the Office of Preservation Programs of the National Archives and Records Administration will provide technical assistance and oversight in identifying specific design features, and particularly those which must be built into the permanent and archival records storage areas during construction.</p>
<p>The record storage space should have a minimum of fifteen feet, one inch clear stacking height above finished floor. The space must be contiguous and the major segments individually must be fully occupiable on a priority and phased basis from start of buildout/construction over an estimated one-year to one and one-half year period. All office, records storage, and records handling equipment, such as furniture, ladders, carts, pallets, and forklifts are to be furnished by the Government at no cost to the Offeror. The Offeror shall provide the shelving.</p>
<p>OFFICE/ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE - The office facility shall be a Class A space. It is to be functionally located in relation to the records storage bays for efficient operations. All offices and rooms located along the exterior walls shall have windows unless otherwise specified in this document. It shall be fully sprinklered (light hazard). The finished ceiling shall be at least 9 feet, but not more than 11 feet AFF. Lighting in the office areas shall be recessed.

Processing offices, work areas including conference rooms, research rooms and lobby shall have office-level HVAC with multiple zones and units based on room function. All internal circulation paths must be a minimum of 60 inches wide.</p>
<p>Employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors shall be available within a 10.0 mile radius of the facility.</p>
<p>Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain. The space must meet the "Green" requirements in the Solicitation. Space must be ready for occupancy on May 2011 or sooner. Phased occupancy will be required.</p>
<p>Brokers or agents may represent the prospective landlord, but any properties or proposals submitted by brokers/agents must be accompanied by written evidence that they are authorized to represent the building's ownership. For existing buildings, written expressions of interest should include building name and address, location of space in the building, rentable square feet offered and rentable rate per square foot (specifying services and utilities included), ANSI/BOMA defined usable square feet, percentage of common area factor used to determine the rentable square feet, one-eighth inch scale drawing of space offered, current site zoning and contact information for owner or authorized agent.

<DESC><p>The General Services Administration (GSA) Great Lakes Region announces an opportunity for construction services for the renovation of the main lobby entrance and rear lobby entrance at the Harold Washington Social Security Center located at 600 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.&nbsp; The procurement will be issued as a lump sum, firm fixed-price contract open to all business concerns in accordance with the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. The estimated total construction cost for the project falls within the range of $1,000,000.00 to $5,000,000.00, with an anticipated project duration of approximately 4 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The existing space will be renovated to be in compliance with the Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 12 (HSPD-12).&nbsp; The project scope consists of the removal of existing kiosks, demolition of existing wood guard stations, patching of the existing terrazzo floor, and installation of turnstiles, card readers, overhead canopies, new guard kiosks and stations and glass barrier walls. Infrastructure modifications include the installation of new 120VAC power as required for the operation of turnstiles, video signage monitors, magnetometers and x-ray equipment. Additional modifications to the space include additional conduit to support existing devices and ensure proper operation of new devices and CCTV LAN network.</p>
<p>The "best value trade-off process" will be utilized in this procurement for the evaluation of offers and the selection of the successful Offeror to receive the award.&nbsp; The Government will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of both the technical factors and the total evaluated price.&nbsp; For this procurement, the technical factors will be significantly more important than price.&nbsp; The technical factors will include past experience on similar projects, past performance on similar projects, qualifications and experience of key personnel and project management plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Small Business Participation:&nbsp; In accordance with the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, this procurement is unrestricted and is therefore open to both large and small business concerns. Although this procurement is open to large business, small businesses are encouraged to participate. In accordance with Public Law 95-507, the offeror will be required to provide the maximum practicable opportunities for small, disadvantaged, veteran owned, service disabled veteran owned and HUBZone businesses through subcontracting opportunities.&nbsp; In the event a large business (small businesses are not subject to this requirement) is the awardee, an acceptable subcontracting plan must be reviewed and approved by SBA prior to award of this contract. Large businesses shall be required to demonstrate a proactive effort to have participation from small, small disadvantaged, small woman-owned, small HUBZone and small veteran-owned business concerns.

Having to complete this monitoring with another contractor will cause a failure to complete the critical 2009 wet season monitoring due to delays resulting from training up and mobilizing another contractor.  WAR has all the elements lined up to support this activity , in the required timeframe, such as having the labs identified that can perform the ultra trace analyses for the pesticides,  personnel trained to collect and identify native versus non native snails, have equipment currently on station to complete this monitoring program and are able to complete this monitoring without any startup delays that would result from the required training . <BR><BR>An award to any other source would affect the U S Army Corps of Engineers ability to provide the technical information required in the required timeframe, and would not provide any cost savings to the Government.  Not providing the necessary technical information in the required timeframe will result in significant costs to the Government as the pump station turnover to the local sponsor will be delayed and the operational permitting process will also be delayed.<BR><BR>This Notice of Intent is not a request for proposals.  Information received from interested parties will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Responses may be submitted by mail, FAX, or e-mail by Tuesday, November 3, at 2:30 p.m. EST. <BR><BR>Point of Contact, Contract Specialist, Telephone No. (904)232-3820, E-mail:  brenda.l.martin@usace.army.mil 	<BR>

<DESC>The Joint Program Office for Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (JPO MRAP) vehicles is currently conducting an engineering study with the six (6) Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of MRAP variants to support design considerations for the platform suspension system upgrade.  The variants include the MaxxPro Dash, RG-31, MaxxPro Plus, Super MaxxPro, Buffalo, and Caiman.  The MRAP program office requires the technical evaluation support of subject matter experts in heavy military combat vehicle suspension systems and mobility.
The MRAP program requires this evaluation to be conducted on a test course that replicates the Afghanistan profile.  This is required as the MRAP's mission will be primarily OEF (Afghanistan) and the suspension system must be measured and assessed across this terrain to understand any deficiencies that may exist prior to fielding the vehicles on this mission profile.
The JPO MRAP will provide up to five (5) vehicles with baseline suspension systems and prototype suspension systems to the test facility.  Additional vehicles may be added, with quantities and time of delivery determined prior to exercise of options.  The test facility shall be tasked to evaluate the current suspension systems for deficiencies in mobility, and provide input to engineering studies of alternate suspension systems.  The facility must have current knowledge and expertise in commercial and military suspension systems on vehicles in the Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) range of 39-60K.

<p>The NUC requests information about the overall capabilities of vendors to provide product / equipment enterprise solutions to facilitate a phased deployment of WLAN 802.11n mixed mode and wired guest access for various locations on the House Campus.</p>
<p>The NUC would like to review creative and cost effective solutions to provision network management tools, hardware/software, training, pricing, and on-going a la carte maintenance of WLAN 802.11n mixed mode products and wired guest access. The NUC is particularly interested in prior WLAN &amp; wired guest enterprise solution experiences with government agencies as well as technical solutions and pricing schemes. Firm quotes or proposals are NOT requested at this time.</p>
<p>The NUC intends to develop a Wireless LAN 802.11n mixed mode &amp; Wired Guest Enterprise Solution initially to designated hotspots throughout the House Campus and thereafter organically growing the solution to other portions of the campus as accessible.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;hotspot' areas include but are not limited to: House cafeterias, Committee hearing rooms and ante rooms, conference rooms, self-scheduled meeting rooms, banquet rooms, press areas and other common or mass meeting areas as designated.</p>

<p>The NUC is seeking scalable pricing solutions that seek to diminish expensive and cost restricting add-on licensing fees and specifically explain and identify the evolutionary path of Draft 2.0 802.11n products that will evolve into available 802.11n products and how that product and equipment evolution may impact product costs and availability over the next three years.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit written responses in Microsoft Word and/or Adobe Acrobat .pdf format to be delivered as an attachment to an e-mail only.

<DESC>This announcement is a Request for Information (RFI).  This is not a request for proposal and no award will be made as a result of this RFI announcement.  This RFI will be used as a means to obtain information on common practices in the commercial marketplace for the services described herein as well as a means to conduct market research.  GSA intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for the services described herein at some point in the future.

The General Services Administration (GSA), Public Buildings Service, National Capital Region, White House Center (WHC) is seeking information from the commercial marketplace on common practices pertaining to renting, leasing or selling of uniforms and/or protective gear to its commercial customers and providing repair, alteration, laundry and dry cleaning services for those uniforms on a scheduled basis.  

The GSA WHC has a relatively large group of employees (approximately 150) on staff who must wear uniforms in the course of performing their day-to-day jobs.  This group is made up painters, plumbers, electricians, elevator mechanics, engineers, carpenters, landscapers, locksmiths, pipefitters, masons, and custodians.  Approximately 50 percent of the shop personnel must wear flame retardant clothing.  Due to the duty location, these employees must look their best at all times while on the job.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) is in the process of seeking a near-term replacement for the Automated Fire Extinguishing System (AFES) in Marine Corps tactical wheeled vehicles (TWVs) identified herein. This RFI seeks to obtain data from sources that are capable of fully satisfying this need. The information requested is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a commitment of any kind. Any information received, in whole or in part, may be used to create the resulting acquisition strategy for a potential requirement. Responders will not be reimbursed for any information received and are encouraged not to provide proprietary data or business sensitive information as any information received may be used by the Government and / or released to the public. However, proprietary information received in response to this market research synopsis will be safeguarded and protected in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). Proprietary information submitted as a result of this market research shall be marked in accordance with FAR 52.215-1(e). The Government is seeking suitable commercial items, developmental items, or commercial items that can be easily modified to meet existing Government requirements. Information on capable sources is sought for the following desired characteristics: 
The system must provide the ability to protect Marines against internal cab fires caused by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) and other munitions.  An aqueous based, non-toxic fire suppression agent and delivery system mounted in the vehicle cab is desired.  The fire suppression agent should also employ cooling properties which immediately cool the cab environment and provide protection from skin burns to personnel in the cab.  The system should be designed to be automatically activated by system sensors that detect a fire event and should also provide a manual discharge option. The system shall be compatible with a vehicle electrical system per MIL-STD-1275, characteristics of 28 volt DC Electrical Systems in Military Vehicle, without generic any false alarms or suffering to any systems or platform components. The system shall be operated over an input voltage range of 18-30 VDC and is desired to draw no more than 30 amps during extinguisher(s) discharge. The system should not cause hearing damage to occupants of the cab after activation. The Government desires a system comparable in weight and space claim to the current FM 200 AFES system which is currently employed in Marine Corps and Army TWVs.  This system shall be initially designed and tested in Marine Corps HMMWVs and shall have minimal effect on the existing configuration of the HMMWV cab.  The system must not interfere with the crew's ability to egress and ingress of the vehicle.
An Industry Day for interested vendors will be held at Marine Corps Systems Command during November of 2009.  During the Industry Day vendors in attendance will be free to take measurements and photographs of Marine Corps HMMWVs in order to assess cab dimensions, space claim, etc.  Interested parties should contact the Government Contract Specialist listed below for additional information.  Sources capable of satisfying the above requirements should submit capability statements/expressions of interest providing the Government the necessaryinformation to determine actual capability. At a minimum, this information should include: 1) identification of your company or organization, 2) your company's or organization's assertion of existing, full capability to meet proposed requirements, 3) business/contacts/marketing office point(s) of contact information, 4) notification of business size and/or special status and 5) any additional information that may be useful to the successfulprocurement of the requirements, if solicited. These expressions of interest shall adhere to a two (2) pages submission limit, plus commercial marketinginformation or web links and all should be submitted via email to Michelle Etienne at michelle.etienne@usmc.mil, referencing the following tracking #M67854-10-R-5013.

<DESC>For complete notice email maina.gakure@va.gov or visit our website:http://www.va.gov/ASSETMANAGEMENT/EnhancedUse/Knoxville/index.asp                  Request for Expressions of Interest# VA 101-10-RI-0004Redevelopment of the Knoxville VA Medical Center (VAMC) CampusKnoxville, IAIssued by:The Department of Veterans AffairsKnoxville VAMC1515 W. Pleasant Street Knoxville, Iowa 50138Responses due:   11:00 a.m.    [11/09/2009]I.  INTRODUCTIONThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is pleased to issue this Request for Expressions of Interest (REI) for the redevelopment of the Knoxville VA Medical Center (VAMC) in Knoxville, IA through a long-term ground lease.  VA is seeking market information regarding the viability of redevelopment of the Knoxville VAMC site through responses to this REI.  From its review of the responses, VA will determine if there is the breadth and depth of interest from qualified respondents to proceed with a detailed Request for Qualifications (RFQ), followed by a Request for Proposals (RFP) from the best qualified respondents to the RFQ.II. BACKGROUNDIn 1997, the Knoxville VAMC, located in Marion County, IA, consolidated with the Des Moines VAMC to form the VA Central Iowa Health Care System.  Though 40 miles apart, the two campuses operate cohesively and under the same leadership.  Operations at the Knoxville VAMC will cease in 2009 and its services will be relocated to the Des Moines VAMC.  In preparation, the campus has been consolidated, with services concentrated in structures located on the eastern portion of the property.  With the exception of Building 1 and any associated utility structures necessary for its operations, the campus will be vacated by November 16, 2009. III. THE OPPORTUNITYSite Address1515 W. Pleasant StreetKnoxville, Iowa 50138Site DescriptionThe Knoxville VAMC campus is comprised of approximately 163 acres and is divided into three parcels: Parcel A is approximately 40 vacant acres, Parcel B is approximately 38 vacant acres; including VAs sewage treatment plant and a one(1)-acre cemetery, and Parcel C is approximately 85 acres; including 787,000 SF of existing improvements.  Parcels A and B both have limited physical constraints (pond, cemetery). While Parcel A is available for immediate reuse, Parcels B and C, will not become available until the entire campus is vacated and available for reuse in January 2011. Site AccessThe Knoxville VAMC is about 45 minutes from the closest metropolitan area, Des Moines, IA. It is located near two major highways; approximately 15 minutes from state highway IA-5, and two minutes from state highway IA-92.  Its main entrance is located on Business Highway 5 / 92.  Along the northeast corner, a short-line railroad runs between the site and the Knoxville Race Track, allowing for a potential rail spur.  Site InfrastructureThe campus is connected to city water, gas and electricity.  It treats its own waste water via an on-site treatment plant and generates its own healing and cooling via a boiler / chiller plant.Site ZoningThe site is located within the Knoxville city limits and is zoned A-1 Agricultural on Parcels A and B and R1 and R2 residential on Parcel C.  Since the property is a Federal enclave, it is exempt from local zoning regulations.  However, in accordance with its good neighbor policy, VA seeks to build in agreement with local standards and regulations in private sector reuse scenarios.  The City of Knoxville is supportive of finding an appropriate reuse for the site and has indicated its willingness to make zoning adjustments to facilitate redevelopment as long as the proposed redevelopment plan does not disrupt the surrounding nearby residential community.IV. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS VA is seeking information relating to general concepts and a preliminary price proposal for successful, financially viable, redevelopment and operational management of the Knoxville, IA VAMC campus.  Interested respondents should provide:1)	Company Information and Relevant Experience: Name of respondent and a three to five (3  5) page description of any experience that is pertinent to the redevelopment of the Knoxville VAMC;2)	Project Narrative: A narrative of no more than five (5) typed 8  x 11 pages, outlining the respondents proposed Knoxville VAMC redevelopment concept, including:a)	Project Summary:  Project summary (i.e. table) including respondent name, project name, total development square footage, total development cost and date of completionb)	Vision:  The vision for the project and its role in Knoxville, IA c)	Proposed Use:  Enumeration of the proposed use(s) and the general allocation of their size and location within the Knoxville VAMC campusd)	Implementation Plan:  Brief overview of how the principal spaces, systems and building elements would be modified, reused or demolished (This should be very general)e)	Development Timeframe:  A general overview of the development timeframe (subdivided into phases if necessary), identifying the estimated length of time to reach key milestones including: Commencement and completion of design; Commencement and completion of construction; Potential tenants; and Operational stabilizationf)	Project Costs: High-level estimate of total development costs for the project, including a preliminary indication of proposed sources and uses. 3)	Graphics: Submission of graphics to illustrate vision would be helpful but are not required.  If included, graphics should not exceed five (5) pages (8  x 11). Graphics do not need to be elaborate; graphics may be used as a way to convey the vision in clear, simple and conceptual terms.  Graphics may include sketches, overhead maps, conceptual floor plans, and/or photographs of: a)	Knoxville VAMCb)	Other projects undertaken by the development team members; and/orc)	Projects undertaken by others which illustrate the respondents vision for the Knoxville VAMCV.

Wallowa-Whitman NF

Draft Project Overview

The following project description will, most definitely, change between now and when the solicitation is advertised, but due to the season in which this solicitation will be advertised, this project is being announced so that potential offerors may visit the site and ensure conditions are seen before the snow covers the project area.  

There will be no scheduled showing trips nor will a Forest Service employee be available to accompany prospective bidders to the site. However, bidders are reminded that is is their responsiblity to determine for themselves the actual site conditions and only by physical inspection, on-the-ground viewing can offerors assure themselves of the existing conditions. Maps are available at the Whitman Ranger District office. Thank you.

The set aside has not been determined.

The Anthony Lakes Highway project is approximately 10 miles long, and is one of the higher standard paved roads on the Forest.  The project requires, but is not limited to construction staking, clearing and grubbing, slope rounding, excavation, slope scaling, drainage structures, culverts, geo-textile, riprap, aggregate, pit development, asphalt re-surfacing, hydro seeding and mulching, signs, and temporary traffic control.  In addition, there are utilities buried in the road that need to be protected.

The project is divided into four (4) segments.  Segment A (6.13 mi.) requires crack sealing, and a chip seal over the existing asphalt surface.  Segment B (2.55 mi.) requires pulverizing the existing asphalt, adding base aggregate and repaving with new hot mix asphalt.  Segment C (0.21 mi.) requires sub-excavating the road and replacing the road structure with geo-textile material, base and surface aggregate, and repaving with hot mix asphalt.  Segment D (0.60 mi.) also requires crack sealing and a chip seal.

There are four (4) design sections that will address cut slope stabilization.  These sections target cut slopes by either benching the existing slope or reconstructing the cut slope to a gentler ratio.  The remaining cut slope stabilization sections will be addressed by slope scaling.

Excavation from the design sections, slope scaling sections, and slope rounding will be utilized in the Anthony Lakes Ski Run parking lot expansion (Sta. 477+50), and the Anthony Snow Park parking lot expansion (Sta. 513+80).  Stump disposal, wood chip, and excavation waste area are located on Rd. 7300140 (Sta. 440+97).  Additional alternative excavation waste areas may be utilized at (Sta. 509+00), and Anthony Lakes Ski Run bunny hill re-contouring (Sta. 484+50) if needed.

To further stabilize the cut slopes, hydro seeding, and wood chip mulch will be placed on the cut slopes to provide erosion control.

<DESC>RECOVERY  PER FAR 5.7  THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY; THEREFORE FAR 5.203 DOES NOT APPLY.  THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR UNDER W91278-08-C-0028.<BR><BR>Provide Operation and Maintenance of  Government  Owned Facilities and Equipment at Alabama River Lakes Project.<BR> <BR>Using Recovery Act Funding, The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification to contract number W91278-08-C-0028, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee (CPAF) contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Alabama River Lakes Project, awarded to Eagle Aviation Services and Technology, Inc., 1801 Robert Fulton Drive STE 450, Reston, Virginia.  Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for in order to upgrade Gunter Hill Campground Catoma Loop, including the re-routing and addition of roads, renovation of campsite spurs including addition of concrete parking pads, and upgrading of water and electric utility distribution systems.  The work will include removing some existing asphalt paving and outdated campsite furniture and border timbers.  The work is within the scope of the original contract's technical provisions which includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems in all of the recreation areas.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>The existing contract must be used for the following reasons:  1) The contractor is already responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of this recreation area.  2)  The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation.  3)  This contract enables repairs to begin immediately without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public access to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.    <BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>USTRANSCOM is conducting Market Research to be used in the development of a Concept of Operations (CONOPS) for a possible future transportation network for the Defense Courier Service (DCS).  We are seeking information from the airline industry on the best commercial practices to move two couriers and sensitive/classified material in sealable containers via air as follows:  

Two United States Transportation Command DoD Couriers with personal baggage and airline provided sealable canisters of various sizes based on cargo weight (average weights per route subject to change) according to the following schedule:
	Baltimore to Sacramento approximately 4,800 lbs weekly
	Sacramento to Baltimore approximately 4,200 lbs weekly
	Baltimore to San Antonio approximately 2,500 lbs weekly
	San Antonio to Baltimore approximately 1,900 lbs weekly
	Baltimore to Omaha approximately 3,500 lbs bi-weekly
	Omaha to Baltimore approximately 2,100 lbs bi-weekly
	Sacramento to Seattle approximately 900 lbs bi-weekly
	Seattle to Sacramento approximately 450 lbs bi-weekly

(Preferred airports: BWI, Sacramento, San Antonio, Omaha, Seattle.  Other airports in the Baltimore (Dulles, Regan, etc.) and Sacramento (San Francisco) area could be used.)

 - Prefer all flights to be conducted roundtrip.  However couriers can remain overnight if required and return next day. 
 - On departing flights the canisters must be under constant observation of ground Couriers until the aircraft cargo door is sealed. 
- On arriving flights ground couriers must be positioned to view the cargo doors opening and then must observe the containers being removed from the belly of the aircraft.  The container must be kept in constant view of the Couriers.
 - In the event of deviations to the final destination then the TWO couriers on board would have to deplane prior to the aircraft cargo doors being opened.  The couriers must have visibility of the doors being opened and courier cargo being removed.  They must keep their containerized cargo in view at all times.

For the purpose of market research only, industry representatives are invited to meet with Government representatives to discuss commercial operations that could meet this requirement on November 3rd at Scott Air Force Base, IL.  Contact Mr. John Sheahan at john.sheahan@ustranscom.mil to schedule an appointment.  In preparation, please provide answers to the following questions via e-mail to the Contracting Officer, Marie Pendergast at marie.pendergast@ustranscom.mil NLT 29 Oct 09.

QUESTIONS

1)  Are you a Far part 121 air carrier operating on the same or similar routes as those listed above?   What is your experience in the type of effort described above?  

2)  Describe specific processes currently being used that would emulate the requirement described above.  Describe the type and size cargo containers used by your company including information on whether the containers protect contents from exposure to weather (i.e. rain, snow) and whether they are sealable with a numbered security strap to prevent unauthorized opening.    Include information to determine best days to move cargo containers and a process for reserving seats, cargo space, and defining container size.  Do you permit containers to be picked up 24-48 hours prior to flight to permit preloading of contents or is there a secure indoor area for loading/unloading cargo?  

3)  Please provide any suggestions/recommendations and best practices of your company which could be considered in the development of the CONOPS for DCSs possible future transportation network.

<DESC>SYNOPSIS:PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. The U. S. Department of the Interior (DOI) Minerals Management Service (MMS) has a competitive requirement to investigate the potential to increase hydrocarbon recovery on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) by the use of cutting-edge subsea alternative recovery methods and systems to be awarded to the offeror whose Quote gives evidence of the greatest value to the Government as outlined in this synopsis.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 12.6, in conjunction with FAR 13.5, as applicable and as supplemented with additional information included in the notice.  Solicitation number M10PS00138 is being issued as a Request for Quote (RFQ) using Simplified Acquisition Procedures. This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-37 and the Department of Interior Acquisition Regulation (DIAR).  It is the contractor's responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code is 541330 entitled Engineering Services, with a small business size standard of $4.5M. QUOTATION PREPARATION INSTRUCTIONS: To ensure timely and equitable evaluation of quotes, Offeror must comply with instructions contained herein. Quotes must be complete, self-sufficient, and respond directly to the requirements of this RFQ. The response shall consist of a technical and a cost/price quote. The Government anticipates awarding a Firm Fixed Price award as a result of this RFQ.  The Offeror shall prepare their quote in accordance with the Statement of Work and requirements below:OBJECTIVE: The Minerals Management Service (MMS), through the Technology Assessment and Research (TA&R) Program intends to competitively award a contract to determine the benefits of the new subsea alternative recovery methods, such as artificial lift, waterflood, and subsea processing equipment and systems to improve hydrocarbon recovery on the U.S. OCS.




SCOPE: 
The contractor shall present a summary of current offshore technologies incorporating artificial lift installations, such as gas lift and electrical submersible pumps (ESPs), waterflood, and subsea processing including boosting from the sea floor and from vertical caisson separators.  The use of the latest subsea pumps, subsea compression, and subsea separation technologies are to be included.  This study should include installations on the OCS as well as other offshore areas such as the North Sea and Brazil.  A complete list of references used in the study shall be reported.A comprehensive review of case histories showing estimated or projected additional hydrocarbon recovery shall be presented for the different methodologies.  In addition, installation and operating costs (including additional produced water handling) associated with each system, their reliability with documented run life data, well intervention frequency and costs, criteria for the application of specific artificial lift, waterflood, and subsea processing technologies, advantages and disadvantages over other lifting and boosting systems, technical challenges, and the future outlook for the technology shall be investigated.  The contractor shall also identify the effectiveness of these systems to increase hydrocarbon recovery and estimate the potential increase in Gulf of Mexico (GOM) OCS production with their application.Specific methods shall be identified and explained in detail showing how the MMS could predict the volume of increased recovery that results from subsea alternative recovery methods at any given location.  All variables required for these calculations shall be defined and discussed in order to elaborate on the expected ranges of their values and methods for determining or estimating each variable.The analysis shall include the effects of various reservoir drive mechanisms, fluid characteristics such as water cut and gas-oil ratio, reservoir depth, water depth, production volume, and solids production on these systems.  Flow assurance issues including hydrate, asphaltene and paraffin formation should be discussed.

DISCUSSIONS/AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS
The Government reserves the right to award without discussions, so it is in your best interest to include your most favorable terms in your initial submission.  However, the Government reserves the right to conduct discussions and to permit Offeror to revise their submissions.
As stated above, the Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions, except for clarifications as described herein.  Any exceptions or deviations by the offeror to the terms and conditions stated in this RFQ for inclusion in the resulting award may make the offer unacceptable for award without discussions.  If an offeror proposes exceptions to the terms and conditions of these requirements, the Government may make an award, without discussions, to another Offeror that did not take exception to the terms and conditions, if such offeror is determined to be the best overall value for this effort. 
Clarifications are limited exchanges with Offeror that may occur when award without discussions is contemplated. If award will be made without conducting discussions, Offeror may be given the opportunity to clarify certain aspects of quotes (e.g., the relevance of an Offerors past performance information and adverse past performance information to which the offeror has not previously had an opportunity to respond) or to resolve minor or clerical errors.
EVALUATION FACTORS FOR AND BASIS FOR AWARD
This is a competitive best value acquisition utilizing simplified procedures.   The technical proposal shall be evaluated based on the following evaluation criteria, listed in descending order of importance, to determine which Offeror is considered to be the best overall value to the Government:  
A.  Past PerformanceB.  Technical Approach
PAST PERFORMANCE (CRITERION A):  Past performance is the most important criteria.  Past performance includes adherence to schedules and budgets, effectiveness of cost control, the acceptability of previous products delivered, effectiveness of program management, and the offeror's willingness to cooperate with the customer in both routine matters and when confronted with unexpected difficulties. The offeror shall include at least five references of similar contracts that demonstrate the capability to meet similar timeframes over the last five years. For each contract, include a description of the project, project title, contract number, period of performance, contract amount, and client identification (including agency or company name, contracting and technical reviewing official, address, and telephone number). MMS will contact some or all of the customers listed as Past Performance references in the offerors proposal.  MMS will ask questions such as:  whether or not they believe (1) that the offeror was capable, timely, efficient, and effective; (2) that the offerors performance conformed to the terms and conditions of the contract; (3) that the offeror was reasonable and cooperative during the performance; (4) that the offeror was committed to customer satisfaction; and (5) whether the work performed by the contractor was of high quality.  
TECHNICAL APPROACH (CRITERION B):            
(1) Appropriateness of tasks cited to complete the project; (2) The quality and availability of the personnel with the requisite expertise (skills, abilities, education, professional credentials and experience) to accomplish the work as proposed; (3) Innovative or creative approaches used to conduct the work; (4) Feasibility of the approach or solution; (5) The offerors understanding of the technical issues being presented for consideration; and (6) The offerors ability to implement the proposed approach as determined by adequate detailed analysis and supported by specific accomplishments in the technical field to be assessed.  
EVALUATION OF QUOTES:  Quotes shall be prepared in accordance with and comply with the instructions above.  The technical submission will be evaluated separately from the price.  Each submission will be evaluated against the evaluation factors listed above.  Each offerors quoted cost shall be submitted SEPARATELY and detail the costs associated with each proposed task to include man hours, travel and required equipment and/or services.  Each offeror shall submit a labor hour rate scheduled for each category or labor that may be assigned to the project for future work.  
Each offeror's quoted price will be evaluated for reasonableness. Price will always be an important factor; therefore, offerors should make diligent efforts to control costs and submit fairly priced quotes.  After evaluating price, award may be made to other than the low offeror, when the contracting officer determines it to be in the Government's best interest. 
The selected Offeror must comply with the following commercial item terms and conditions, which are incorporated herein by reference: FAR 52.212-1, Instructions to Offerors - Commercial Items, applies to this acquisition; FAR 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications - Commercial Items - the selected offeror must submit a completed copy of the listed representations and certifications; FAR 52.212-4, Contract Terms and Conditions - Commercial Items; FAR 52.212-5, Contract Terms and Conditions Required To Implement Statutes or Executive Orders-Commercial Items, paragraph (a) and the following clauses in paragraph (b): 52.222-21, 52.222-26, 52.222-35, 52.222-36, 52.222-37, 52.225-13, 52.232-34.

POINT-OF-CONTACT (POC):  Nancy Hilleary, Contract Specialist, Phone:  703-428-6120, FAX:  703-428-8181, E-MAIL:  Nancy.L.Hilleary@usace.army.mil<BR><BR>Request for Proposals:  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK<BR>	Climate Change Downscaling Projections for<BR>	 The Institute for Water Resources<BR><BR>Introduction:  Managing hydrologic extremes due to climate variability is an essential mission of water management agencies. The USACE must ensure that its systems and projects will remain adaptable and sustainable over time even if the frequency and severity of extreme hydrologic events may change. The USACE water managers are considering ways to make water management more flexible and adaptable to changing conditions. The USACE climate change strategy is to work closely with other Federal agencies to develop consistent approaches with regard to policies related to climate change. USACE is also trying to coordinate climate change activities with state governments and others so approaches can be integrated.<BR><BR>As part of this approach, USACE formed an interagency workgroup on climate change and water resources with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the Bureau of Reclamation, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) (National Weather Service and Office of Atmospheric Research) to evaluate how climate change considerations can be incorporated into activities related to the Nation's water resources. The result was a USGS circular Climate Change and Water Resources Management: A Federal Perspective (Brekke et al 2009, http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/1331/). USACE was represented in this effort by co-authors Dr. Olsen and Dr. White. The report presents the best available science to help water managers prepare for and adapt to the effects of climate change on the nations water resources. The report suggested as one of 12 key points the following:<BR><BR>Key Point 7: Current expectations about future climate may indicate<BR>a need to supplement historical climate information. Planning<BR>assumptions might instead be related to projections of future<BR>temperature and precipitation. This can be accomplished using a<BR>multitude of approaches; a best approach has yet to be determined.<BR><BR>The USACE Actions for Change Theme 1 (AFC T1) Temporal and Spatial Systems Changes PDT (TSSC PDT) headed by Dr. Olsen has been working closely with external experts, and with fellow operating agency Reclamation in particular, to identify methods that could be used to incorporate downscaled climate projections in USACE planning and engineering in a systematic manner consistent with other Federal agencies (e.g., Maurer et al 2007).<BR> <BR>These resulting projections will be freely distributed to researchers, decision-makers, and members of the public who need quantitative information about future climate change in the U.S.<BR><BR>Goals and Objectives:  The basic goal of this Contract is to produce fine-resolution projections of future climate change. <BR><BR>Description of Required Services: Produce downscaled projections from general circulation models (GCMs) of daily minimum temperature, daily maximum temperature, daily mean temperature, and precipitation to support consistent local and regional evaluation of potential climate change impacts to public safety and water resources management and infrastructure. Two proven statistical downscaling approaches will be used: the existing Bias Correction/Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) and the newly developed Bias-Corrected/Constructed Analogs (BCCA) . The resulting projections will be stored as a supplement to the existing initial library of downscaled climate projections currently at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)  .

Offerers are urged to ensure that their proposals are submitted on the most favorable terms to reflect their best possible potential. The technical proposal will describe the capacity of their organization and any anticipated subcontractors to perform the work in accordance with the Scope of Work.<BR><BR>The Government intends to make an award without discussions, based upon initial proposals received, but reserves the right to conduct discussions if deemed necessary.  <BR><BR>The evaluation factors are as follows:<BR><BR>1.	Technical Approach. The specific factors that will be rated in the award process include:<BR><BR>a.	Understanding of the range of relevant substantive issues involved in the work requirement<BR>b.	Analytical framework, procedures, and methods for satisfying the work requirement.<BR><BR>Note: The discussion of technical approach in proposals should be limited to five single-spaced pages.<BR><BR>2.	Technical Experience. Offerers proposals should demonstrate for key personnel specific capabilities in the following areas, which will be rated in the award process:<BR><BR>a.	Experience in the production of downscaled climate projections for the US using two proven, state-of-the-science, spatial downscaling techniques that add meaningful spatial detail to existing coarse-resolution climate simulations (Bias Correction - Spatial Downscaling (BCSD) and Bias Corrected - Constructed Analogs (BCCA)).<BR><BR>b.	Ability to rapidly produce a large library of downscaled projections using these methods, as evidenced by having necessary codes on hand and tested.<BR><BR>c.	An available data archive for housing and distributing downscaled results, including a web interface that allows a selected hyperslab (logically contiguous collection of points in the dataspace) to be downloaded.<BR><BR>d.	Experience in the production of simple adjustments to the BCSD procedure to obtain intermediate datasets for General Circulation Model (GCM) monthly projections re-gridded to a common 2 grid, bias-corrected GCM monthly projections on the 2 grid, and spatially downscaled (but not bias-corrected) monthly climate projections.<BR><BR>e.	Experience in the development, use, and evaluation of global climate models; especially familiarity with the limitations of these models.<BR><BR>f.	Experience working with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), particularly as relates to the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Stage 3 (CMIP3) Multi-Model Dataset Archive.<BR><BR>g.	Experience working in or with federal water resources management agencies, particularly the U.S Army Corps of Engineers and the US Bureau of Reclamation, in climate-change related studies. Similar experience with State water management agencies also desirable.<BR><BR>h.	Possession of a proven system for data visualization and exploration that has been applied to downscaled climate projections.<BR><BR>i.	Experience in leading a multi-organizational and multi-disciplinary study team.<BR><BR>j.	Experience applying downscale climate projections to numerical modeling of surface hydrology.<BR><BR>k.	Experience developing and applying methods for uncertainty quantification in climate change projections.<BR><BR>Note: The discussion of technical experience of key personnel in proposals should be limited to five single-spaced pages.<BR><BR>3.	Past Performance. Offerers will submit detailed information on prior contract or other efforts involving the 1) downscaling of GCM in the US, and 2) development and use of Geographic Information System databases and modeling techniques for climate-related information associated with general circulation models and downscaling. List and provide profiles for 3-5 relevant efforts, current or completed within the past five years, which demonstrate your and your anticipated subcontractors experience with this type of work. Profiles of contract efforts should include dates, location, types of contracts, dollar values, description of the work and references. Reference information should include the name, address, fax number and telephone number of the Contracting Officer or other contract administrator. References should also be provided for any anticipated subcontractors to be used. <BR><BR>4.	Price. Price proposals will be evaluated for reasonableness and to determine the best overall value to the government. This factor will be judged on the degree to which the proposed cost/price elements are reasonable and consistent with the work to be performed. Excessively high or low cost/price may be deemed to indicate a lack of understanding of the scope of work or level of technical expertise required.<BR><BR>Basis for Award<BR><BR>The relative order of importance of the non-price evaluation factors is as follows: the technical approach and technical experience factors are considered equally important. The two sub-factors for technical approach are considered equally important, and the order of importance for the four sub-factors for technical experience correspond to the order in which they are listed (item a is the most important, and item k is the least important). The past performance factor is considered slightly less important than either of the two technical factors. Past performance will be rated by evaluating the profiles for previous contract efforts submitted as evidence of offerers past performance doing related work. Phone interviews with the references submitted for past contract efforts on similar work will be used to confirm those efforts and determine whether they met or exceeded contractual requirements. If an offerer has no past performance, that offerer will receive a neutral rating.<BR><BR>The following rules will apply for award:<BR><BR>1.	All evaluation factors other than cost or price, when combined, are significantly more important than cost or price.<BR><BR>2.	An offerer whose capabilities fail to meet one or more specified evaluation factors will be deemed ineligible for award. <BR><BR><BR><BR>Submit your proposal in accordance with the following CLINs, breaking out Labor by category, hours and hourly rate:<BR><BR>CLIN 0001, Labor Services for Climate Change Downscaling Projections for the US Army Corps of Engineers                       1 LS $_____________<BR><BR>CLIN 0002, Travel					       1 LS $_____________	<BR><BR>CLIN 0003, ODCs				1 LS $_________________<BR><BR>CLIN 0004, Contractor Manpower Reporting Requirements   1 LS  $___________<BR><BR><BR><BR>Contract Manpower Reporting Clause<BR><BR>The Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower & Reserve Affairs) operates and maintains a secure Army data collection site where the contractor will report ALL contractor manpower (including subcontractor manpower) required for performance of this contract.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation HSCG85-10-R-P45352 for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued. This Request for Proposal incorporates provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-32. This is small business set-aside procurement. The NAICS is 336611.
<p>It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe that Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address: Commandant (CG-9131), U.S.Coast Guard Headquarters, Acquisition Planning and Performance Measurement, 1900 Half St. SW, Room 11-0402, Washington, DC. 20593, Telephone (202) 3723692, Fax: (202) 475, 3904.</p>

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS 
United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program

It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO). 

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman. 

Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protesters concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agencys goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:

<SOLNBR>8866
<RESPDATE>102309
<ARCHDATE>11072009
<CONTACT>Princess Cannon, 202-493-4634

<a href="mailto:princess.cannon@faa.gov">princess.cannon@faa.gov</a>
<DESC>This Amendment incorporates NAICS code 334210 which was omitted on the original Market Survey.  Consequently, FAA has extended the response date for the Market Survey until October 23, 2009.
Background: The System Wide Information Management Program (SWIM) will use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) principles in designing and specifying NAS Air Traffic Management (ATM) services.  The FAA is seeking an XML Gateway that meets the Government's requirements to help ensure that the opportunities and benefits of SOA are achieved. 
Purpose:This is a market survey for the SWIM XML Gateway Qualified Vendor's List. This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposal of any kind. The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.
The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey. Therefore any cost associated with the market survey submission is solely at the interested vendors' expense.
At this time the nature of the competition has not been determined. The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set-aside all or part of the procurement for small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, or eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the SBA for participation in the SBA's 8(a) program. The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of interest and capabilities from interested business concerns, including SBA certified 8(a) firms and other small business concerns, capable of providing standard, commercial XML Gateways which meets the Government's requirements. 
Furthermore, this survey will aid the FAA in its determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses that are certified by the Small Business Administration (SBA) for participation in the SBA's 8(a) Program, and other small businesses such as Women Owned businesses and Service Disabled Veteran businesses or whether it is more appropriate to conduct this procurement as a full and open competition. 
Requirements:In order to make the determination as to whether adequate competition exists to set-aside part or all of the competition amongst eligible socially and economically disadvantaged businesses the FAA requires a Capability Statement from interested vendors. The Capability Statement should address your firm's technical capability to provide the product and services described in the Requirements Document. Limited to four (4) pages, it should include the following:1.	A list of similar projects undertaken.  For each project cited, please provide the following information: Name of project, Contract number, Customer Name, Brief Description of project or services/XML Gateway product provided, start and end dates, and any other relevant information.2.	Expected programmatic approach, i.e., in-house, teaming, or subcontracting. If your organization is an eligible 8(a) certified business or other small business, please provide the percentage of work to be completed by the 8(a) or small business respondent.  3.	If applicable, a list of all teaming partners with a description of each partner's responsibility. 4.	Business Declaration Form (see attachment).5.	If applicable, Small Business or 8(a) certification letter.
To help you determine if your company is qualified to provide XML Gateway and services necessary for this requirement, the FAA is making available a DRAFT Requirements Document and Qualification Information Request (QIR). The Government welcomes substantive comments on both documents. Please submit comments together with the Capability Statement described above. There is no page limit on comments.  
Contact Information:The FAA prefers that all responses, questions, and/or comments, including attachments, be submitted electronically to the following address:  princess.cannon@faa.gov.  All responses to this market survey must be received no later than October 23, 2009, 12:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time. 
Princess Cannon, Contract SpecialistEmail: princess.cannon@faa.govPhone: 202.493.4634
Follow-up Activity (if any):Note:  The final Requirements Document and QIR are expected to be posted to the FAA Contract Opportunities Website on November 2, 2009 with a response date of November 23, 2009.

<DESC>NRCS-Illinois plans to issue a solicitation for repair of the Gust WRP site, located in Brown County, Illinois, which was completed in 2005 with an in-channel sheet pile drop structure.  During the heavy flooding of 2008, the sheet pile structure was damaged beyond repair, and the levee neighboring the structure has been heavily eroded.

This project will entail removing the sheet pile structure while salvaging the attached hydraulic cylinder, reshaping the channel to its original condition, and filling and reshaping the damaged levee.  Clearing and grubbing to access the site is estimated at 0.3 acres.  Sheet pile is 120 feet in length, is 24 feet in length, and was originally driven in the ground from 15-24 feet deep.  Earthfill quantity is estimated at 779 cubic yards.  Seeding quantity is estimated at 1 acre.

The estimated price range is between $25,000 and $100,000.  Details regarding the pre-bid meeting will be posted at a later date.  The solicitation will be posted at fedbizopps.gov on or about October 19, 2009.  Any changes to the solicitation will be made only at www.fedbizopps.gov; it is the responsibility of the contractor to monitor this web address for any posted changes prior to submitting a quote.

To be eligible for award, prospective contractors must complete Online Representations and Certifications (ORCA) electronically at http://orca.bpn.gov in conjunction with required registration in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database.  

Forward any questions in writing to Bernita Clark, Contracting Officer at bernita.clark@il.usda.gov.

<CONTACT>Dan McPherson, Leasing Contracting Officer, Phone 303-236-8000 x2359, Fax 303-236-7256, Email dan.mcpherson@gsa.gov
<DESC><p>This is a Notice of Intent by the General Services Administration to solicit a modified full service lease (tenant shall pay for electrical consumption) for warehouse and office space. The Federal Government has a requirement to lease approximately 161,705 BOMA rentable square feet for the National Archives Records Administration (NARA) of Denver, Colorado. The proposed building must yield approximately 34,705 BOMA useable square feet of office space and 127,000 BOMA useable square feet of contiguous warehouse space. The site shall be able to accommodate 100 on-site parking spaces available for visitors, handicap and employees. Lease shall be full service and below prospectus threshold with a maximum term up to twenty (20) years.</p>
<p>The delineated area of consideration is as follows:</p>
<p>North - State Hwy 14/Cty Rd 82 (Weld County)<br />West - Federal Hwy 287 (Fort Collins) to Wadsworth Pkwy/Blvd (Denver) to 6th Avenue then west to C-470<br />South - 6th Avenue (Denver) west to Wadsworth Pkwy/Blvd then South to Alameda Avenue/Pkwy then west to C-470<br />East - County Rd 43 (Weld County) to I-76 to E-470 to 6th Avenue</p>
<p>GSA is interested in considering sites for new construction or existing facilities that meet the following minimum requirements. The proposed location must be currently zoned for the intended use, building infrastructure (water, sewer, utilities) to the proposed site must be in-place or readily available, and the site must have paved access to major highways. Proximity to area cultural and education institutions is desirable. The proposed building requires a 100 foot setback from parking areas and roads. The proposed site to accommodate the facility could range from 12 to 17 acres and must be secured by a fence.</p>
<p>The proposed facility must comply with fire safety, security, and other records protection requirements as stated in 36 CFR 1228 Subpart , available at:<br />http://www.archives.gov/about/regulations/part-1228/k.html .</p>
<p>WAREHOUSE/RECORDS SPACE - The warehouse facility shall consist of five (5) records storage bays (approximately 127,000 usable square feet) consisting of two (2) temporary records bays at 42,000 square feet, one (1) temporary records storage bay at 17,000 square feet, one (1) permanent records storage bay at 12,500 square feet, and one (1) archival storage bay at 13,500 square feet. ALL storage bays must meet the Federal records storage requirements outlined in 36 CFR 1228 Subpart K. In addition, the permanent bay will require office-type air conditioning 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The archival storage bay must meet the NARA 1571 standard for archival space, which details archival requirements for temperature, humidity, air filtration, fire safety, finishes, lighting, etc. available at:<br />http://www.archives.gov/foia/directives/nara1571.pdf.</p>
<p><br />Offerors are specifically placed on notice that requirements for some building elements exceed the normal "warehouse" standards. The Office of Regional Records Services, the Space and Security Division, and the Office of Preservation Programs of the National Archives and Records Administration will provide technical assistance and oversight in identifying specific design features, and particularly those which must be built into the permanent and archival records storage areas during construction.</p>
<p>The record storage space should have a minimum of fifteen feet, one inch clear stacking height above finished floor. The space must be contiguous and the major segments individually must be fully occupiable on a priority and phased basis from start of buildout/construction over an estimated one-year to one and one-half year period. All office, records storage, and records handling equipment, such as furniture, ladders, carts, pallets, and forklifts are to be furnished by the Government at no cost to the Offeror. The Offeror shall provide the shelving.</p>
<p>OFFICE/ADMINISTRATIVE SPACE - The office facility shall be a Class A space. It is to be functionally located in relation to the records storage bays for efficient operations. All offices and rooms located along the exterior walls shall have windows unless otherwise specified in this document. It shall be fully sprinklered (light hazard). The finished ceiling shall be at least 9 feet, but not more than 11 feet AFF. Lighting in the office areas shall be recessed. The finished room sizes are minimum "wall-to-wall" net usable requirements, exclusive of any building common factors or circulation factors. The Government will allow for a dimensional variance of +/- 6" or a room size variance of 2%. Enclosed rooms located adjacent to the records storage bays must have 2-hour fire rated walls for the single wall that is adjacent to the bay. Processing offices, work areas including conference rooms, research rooms and lobby shall have office-level HVAC with multiple zones and units based on room function. All internal circulation paths must be a minimum of 60 inches wide.</p>
<p>Employee services, such as moderately priced restaurants, banks, public transportation, as well as hotel accommodations for visitors shall be available within a 10.0 mile radius of the facility.</p>
<p>Space must meet the Federal Government's standards for fire safety, be capable of being fully accessible to the physically challenged, and be located outside a 100-year floodplain. The space must meet the "Green" requirements in the Solicitation. Space must be ready for occupancy on May 2011 or sooner. Phased occupancy will be required.</p>

<DESC><p>RECOVERY: The General Services Administration (GSA) announces an opportunity for Design and Construction Excellence in Public Buildings. GSA will be using funds from the FY 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for this project.</p>
<p>Continuing a legacy of outstanding public architecture that was initiated with the founding of the nation, the General Services Administration (GSA) Design and Construction Excellence Programs seeks to commission our nation's most talented architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers to design federal buildings of outstanding quality and value. These projects are to demonstrate the value of true integrated design that balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; create environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees; and give form and meaning to our democratic values.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for Design Excellence in public architecture for performance of Architectural-Engineering Design in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all Federal facilities must meet Federal energy and water conservation goals and security requirements outlined in the Guiding Principles for Sustainable New Construction and Major Renovations of Executive Order 13423; achieve fossil fuel reductions, renewable energy and water conservation goals of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007; conform with the Interagency Security Council (ISC) and GSA design standards for secure facilities; conform to GSA's P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings); and comply with the Architectural Barriers Act Accessibility Standards (ABAAS). All GSA projects must achieve a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver rating with specific credits required.</p>
<p><br />PROJECT DESCRIPTION</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to construct a new Tier III Data Center at the Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center will be located in the Northeast corner of the DFC campus on the corner of {East} First Street and North Center Avenue. The Tier III Data Center is based on the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System which will contain redundancy for failure and maintenance and shall be built utilizing the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept.</p>
<p>The building will include 2 stories with a mechanical basement, for 110,000 gross square feet (GSF). The new Data Center will be located in a prominent position on the DFC at the corner of first Street and North Center Avenue, Lakewood, Colorado. The project will be built in phases. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core, shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 20 vehicles.</p>
<p>The project will include the performance of architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning and other related services necessary to construct the new Data Center. Related services include but are not limited to, site planning and infrastructure, geotechnical evaluation and monitoring, permitting, testing and inspection during construction, commissioning and potential additional requirements. The project will be based on 20% Bridging Documents and Program of Requirements, which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program.</p>
<p>SCOPE OF WORK</p>
<p>The project shall be performed in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements for a new Tier III Data Center (Data Center) at the Denver Federal Center (DFC), Lakewood, Colorado. The Data Center is classified as a Tier III facility as defined by the Uptime Institute Tier Level Classification System. The work will be performed under the direction of the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA), Rocky Mountain Region, Public Buildings Service (PBS). The Data Center will be two stories high with a mechanical basement and will be built in phases using the Performance Optimized Datacenter (POD) concept. Phase 1 is the current building project, including core and shell and infrastructure to support the first POD Phase. When complete, the project will contain its own perimeter security system and parking for 2 cars on-site and 20 existing off-site, adjacent to the site. The completed two-story building with mechanical basement will encompass approximately 110,000 Gross Square Feet. As required by law, the facility will meet federal energy goals and all federal accessibility requirements and standards. The project goal will meet LEED-Silver rating requirements. The GSA is the lead agency for the delivery of this facility</p>
<p>The scope of professional services will require the minimum services as follows: architectural, engineering, construction, security, commissioning. This list is not all-inclusive.</p>
<p>GSA will contract separately for Construction Management as Agent (CMa) services. The CMa will be involved in the design process to provide construction expertise, estimating and cost information, and functionality and constructability reviews. There will be a formal partnering process throughout the design and construction phases to promote successful project development and execution through voluntary commitments to accomplish established agreed-upon project objectives by all involved parties.</p>
<p>The estimated cost for the design-build delivery of the new Data Center is between $65,000,000 and $80,000,000.</p>
<p>Opportunities for other than Large Businesses: This procurement will be open to large and small business firms. Any qualified responsible firm, including small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, and women-owned small business is encouraged to participate as a prime contractor or as a member of a joint venture with other small businesses, or as a subcontractor Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d), FAR subpart 19.702 and FAR subpart 19.12. An Offeror that is not a small business concern, offering to perform a contract that has subcontracting possibilities, must submit a Subcontracting Plan that is acceptable to the Contracting Officer which provides subcontracting opportunities to small businesses to the maximum extent practicable. In this procurement, GSA intends to promote contractors' and subcontractors' use of registered Apprenticeship Programs.</p>
<p>NOTICE TO OFFERORS<br />GSA intends to award a firm-fixed price Design-Build Contract based upon 20% bridging documents and Program of Requirements which will be provided with the Request for Proposal during Phase II of the acquisition process for this procurement pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Two-Phase Design-Build Selection Procedures, FAR Subpart 36.3, Source Selection Procedures, FAR subpart 15.3 and the GSA Design Excellence Program. For this contract award process, GSA will issue two Solicitations in sequence: 1) Phase One, and 2) Phase Two. The Phase One procedure (which is analogous to a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) is designed to select a "short list" of the most highly qualified Offerors who will be requested to submit Phase Two proposals. All responsible sources may submit a Phase One Proposal. A maximum of up to five (5) firms will be short listed unless the contracting officer determines that a number greater than five (5) is in the Government's best interest. The most highly rated Offerors will be selected to participate in Phase Two (analogous to Request for Proposals (RFP)).<br /><br />A best value concept will be applied for evaluation of offers and selection of the successful Offeror for this procurement. The best value approach provides the opportunity to select an Offeror who is not necessarily the lowest-priced or the highest technically-ranked. GSA will select the proposal that represents the best value based on the evaluation of technical factors and price, with technical factors being weighed more heavily than price. Therefore, the Offeror's proposal should contain the Offeror's best terms.</p>
<p>This procurement will be conducted as a Two-Phase Deisgn-build process. Phase One will evaluate the technical qualifications and experience of the design and construction teams formed by each potential offeror for this procurement. Phase Two will interview the key Design-Build team members, evaluate the proposed technical solution and Project Management Plan of each design and construction team.</p>
<p>In Phase One, the Government shall identify the evaluation factors other than cost or price that will serve as the basis for the determination of the most highly qualified Offerors. Interested Offerors will be required to submit their responses to the RFQ by the due date established in the RFQ. The Government will evaluate all the responses to the RFQ in accordance with the criteria in the RFQ, and advise each Offeror in writing whether it will be invited to participate in the Phase Two process. Offerors that do not submit a timely RFQ response in Phase One will not be allowed to participate in the remaining phase of the procurement.</p>
<p>In Phase Two, the Government will issue the RFP to the most highly qualified Offerors from Phase One and request that they submit Phase Two proposals. Phase Two of the solicitation shall be prepared in accordance with FAR Part 15 and include Phase Two evaluation factors, developed in accordance with FAR 15.304. Phase Two of the solicitation shall require submission of technical and price proposals, which shall be evaluated separately in accordance with FAR Part 15. The Government will reserve the right to make an award upon the basis of the initial Phase One and Phase Two offers without discussions or negotiations.</p>

<CONTACT>Darrell Parks, Sr. Project Manager, Phone 423/751-4666, Fax 423/751-4619, Email dlparks@tva.gov - Stacci P Thomas, Project Manager, Phone 423/751-8192, Fax 423/751-4619, Email spthomas@tva.gov
<DESC>QUALIFICATION CERTIFICATION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE JOHN SEVIER COMBINED CYCLE PROJECT

This communication is a reissue of the original Qualification Certification dated September 16, 2009 and revised letter dated October 1, 2009.  If the Qualification Certification dated September 16 or October 1 was previously executed, it is not necessary to re-submit this document. 

In the near future, TVA will be issuing a solicitation document to request proposals from experienced firms for the construction and startup of the John Sevier Combined Cycle (JCC) project on a fixed price basis. In addition to the required primary proposal on a fixed price basis, an offeror may also submit an alternate proposal methodology for an optional commercial approach.  The alternate proposal may address such alternate commercial terms where the offeror believes there is commercial benefit to TVA.

The engineering and procurement of major equipment will be performed by URS, Washington Group International.  Currently, TVA has a contract with Washington Group International, Inc., for the construction and startup as well; however TVA is evaluating options for this work to meet TVAs needs.  TVA does not commit to award a contract under this solicitation or to pay any costs incurred in the development and submission of any subsequent proposal.
. 
The scope of work will be defined for the John Sevier Combined Cycle Project, and will be provided in the Request for Proposals (RFP) to all those prospective offerors that certify they meet the Mandatory Minimum Qualifications.

The John Sevier CC project consists of a 3X1 CC (duct fired) plant located near Rogersville, TN.  The CTs will be capable of both natural gas and fuel oil operation, and each CT will have an exhaust  bypass stack and diverter damper  included to allow for both simple cycle and combined cycle operation. The water supply will be from the local river, and this project will include installation of pumps at the river, piping to the plant, clarifiers, and other water treatment equipment. TVA will provide three GE frame 7FA.04 dual fuel CTs, three Nooter-Eriksen HRSGs (triple pressure with duct firing on natural gas), one 400 MW Toshiba steam turbine (TVA purchased on the gray market), and four ABB generator step up transformers.  WGI will be responsible for the engineering and design for the project, and procurement of the other equipment, including:  condenser, cooling tower, boiler feed pumps, circ water pumps. DCS control system, high energy piping, electrical switchgear, generator breakers, etc.   The requirement of this project is to have the plant operating and in-service in simple cycle mode (both gas and oil fuels) by no later than 12/1/11. Meeting this simple cycle CT in-service date is extremely important to TVA due to transmission system reliability issues. The requirement for combined cycle operational in-service date is not later than 5/1/12.  TVA plans to have a natural gas supply to the facility no later than 9/1/11. The installation of the natural gas conditioning equipment (heaters, separators, filter, and pressure reducing valves) will be installed by the construction contractor.  Approximately 4 million gallons of fuel oil storage and associated pumps and heaters will require to be installed. The scope of work is to provide for the installation of all the equipment procured by TVA and WGI, and to commission and startup the plant.  TVA will procure and construct all the equipment in the 161KV switchyard (from the high side of the GSU out), the natural gas pipeline and meter station, and a new access road into the plant.

TVA desires to select a firm with a history of successful construction and startup experience with combined cycle generation projects that are similar to the workscope described above and in the enclosure entitled Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification.  Therefore, in order to receive the RFP, TVA requires that all prospective respondents meet these requirements before being further considered.  All prospective respondents must first certify compliance with the requirements contained on the Mandatory Minimum Qualification Certification. Firms which certify to TVA that they can fully meet all of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements will receive a copy of the RFP and will be invited to attend a mandatory pre-proposal meeting. All offerors will be required to present detailed data (later with their proposals) to substantiate compliance with each of the mandatory minimum qualification requirements.

In order to be considered, I must receive the enclosed Certification signed by an official authorized to bind the organization at the address shown below no later than 12 noon EDT, October 26, 2009.

MANDATORY MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS CERTIFICATION

There are certain mandatory minimum qualifications which offerors must meet in order to be invited to submit proposals and be considered for award of the proposed contract.  Offerors will be required to submit detailed supporting documentation (with their proposals) to substantiate meeting all mandatory minimum qualification requirements. Teaming and subcontracting are acceptable.  However, offerers that provide only construction management and plan to subcontract all the work will not be considered for this project.  The minimum qualification requirements may collectively be satisfied by combining the qualifications of team members and subcontractors committed to perform in the event of award, however, these team members must collectively have worked together as a team in the past and as a team satisfy these minimum qualifications.   Individual qualification criteria, however, must be satisfied by individual entities. The minimum qualifications are as follows:


Offerors must have successfully constructed and started up a minimum of three  Combined Cycle (CC) units of no less  than 500 MW (must be 2X1, 3X1, or 4X1 configurations) capacity with F class technology combustion turbines  (GE 7FAs preferred)  that  have been successfully operational for at least one (1) year.   These  3 CC Projects must also have each met the original (pre-construction start) scheduled in service date and must  have been no more than 3% over the original project budget.   
	
Offeror must have the resources, capability and experience  constructing  and starting up CC projects (of at least the type and magnitude similar to that described above) and be able to demonstrate the ability for project management of complex  CC projects with appropriate proposed structure of the project management team.  
	
Offeror must have the financial capacity (creditworthiness) to guarantee the timely performance, obligations, duties and responsibilities under or related to the contract (including performance and warranty issues), for the term of the contract.
	
Offer must have an established, overall, formalized Total Quality Program (TQP). This TQP must include a detailed SA335, GR.P.91 inspection and installation program.
	
Offeror must have the demonstrated capability to manage the commissioning and start-up of CC units.  Must be capable of field performance testing of the individual equipment (i.e. CTs, Steam turbine, HRSGs, cooling tower, etc.), and the entire CC plant for MW output and efficiency.  
 	
Offeror must be willing to become signatory to TVAs project labor agreement (CPA).  
	
Offeror must have an acceptable safety program with demonstrated ability to assign on-site safety professionals.  The Recordable Injury Rate should be no greater than 1.5 average for the minimum of 3 CC projects described above and a Lost Time Injury Rate of less than .2 average for those same projects.  As part of the offerors proposal, the offeror will be required to submit corporate safety record including workers compensation claim cost per man-hour and environmental compliance record for the CC projects described above.
	
Note:  Other than the mandatory minimum qualifications required for construction and startup of (3) three CC plants, if the offerer believes a valid exception to any of the other mandatory minimum requirements exists, please submit the certification with a detailed explanation of the exception.  TVA will review the exception and make a determination of its acceptability.  No challenges will be accepted to TVAs decision.

Watches shall be on site during all dredged material placement operations, including dewatering of the entire placement area after the dredge stops placing material. The number of employees is expressed as a minimum; accordingly, the Contractor is responsible to provide at his expense the number of employees required to accomplish all work as indicated and specified. If during observance of his work the Contracting Officer determines the Contractors staff on site to be insufficient, additional employees in a number as directed by the Contracting Officer will be provided by the Contractor at his expense. Any damages that result from the negligence of the Contractor to properly manage the dredged material placement and properly maintain the containment dikes shall be fully repaired by the Contractor at his own expense. The Contractor shall leave the placement site in a well maintained condition. The spillbox shall be well maintained with the boards at the correct level and free of trash and debris at all times. During the progress of the work the Contractor shall perform grading and ditching as necessary to eliminate undrained areas within the containment area. At the completion of the scheduled work, the Contractor shall leave the spillbox in a well-maintained and operable condition to assure adequate site drainage.                <BR>

W9128F-09-R-0022/W9128F-10-R-0001<br /><br />On or about 20 October&nbsp;2009, this office will issue Request for Proposals for construction of the RECOVERY - Flood Protection Project, Phase 2c, Big Sioux River and Skunk Creek, Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The solicitation will close on or about 02 December 2009. <br /><br />RECOVERY THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY. <br /><br />This solicitation is UNRESTRICTED AND OPEN TO BOTH LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESS PARTICIPATION. <br /><br />Contractors interested in inspecting the site of the proposed work should contact Dwight Pochant, US Army Corps of Engineers, Phone Number: 605-923-2983. (An exact site visit date and time will be issued with the solicitation).<br /><br />DO NOT submit requests for plans and specifications to the site visit personnel listed above. See Obtaining Solicitation Documents below.<br />_______________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Project Description: (Approx. quantities)<br /><br />Scope of Current Request: Approximately two miles (basic bid plus options) of existing levee will be raised two to five feet in order to provide 100-year flood protection along the Big Sioux River within the City of Sioux Falls. In addition, a concrete gated structure with automated controls will be constructed on the Big Sioux River immediately above the confluence with Skunk Creek. Three areas of tree mitigation and one wetland mitigation area are also required (option).<br /><br />The mass earthwork portion of the project consists of raising the existing levee system including removal, installation or modification of drainage structures (culverts). Construction features include but are not limited to: Clearing and grubbing; stripping; excavation; hauling, placing and compacting embankment fill; and installation/ modification/removal of drainage structures. <br /><br />Construction sequencing is critical as specific reaches have restricted windows of construction:<br /><br />a) Complexity is added to the construction as two reaches of levee construction are severely restricted by a short construction window due to operation of adjacent Golf Courses. <br /><br />b) Construction of the 41st Street Bridge is scheduled to begin in April of 2010 via a contract from the City of Sioux Falls. When construction begins on the bridge, access to 41st Street will not be allowed.

<DESC>RECOVERY ACTION.  FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DUNS 007113228.  The modification addresses the following work:

These funds are for project management and technical staff support including subject matter experts to support recipients in developing their projects and providing content review for block grant applications in support of the Office of Weatherization and Intergovernmental Program.

The action is other than fixed price because work assigned to the Sandia Corporation through the issuance of Work Authorizations (WAs) are pursuant to the terms and conditions of their prime management and operating contract awarded under as a cost reimbursement type contract due to the uncertainties in contract performance.  Cost cannot estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed price contract as the exact nature and duration of the work is uncertain.  The use of a separate fixed price award to Sandia Corporation for the WA is inappropriate because this is issued under an existing cost reimbursable contract.  Sandia was selected by the Department of Energy to participate in this American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) work due to the expertise at Sandia National Laboratories in the subject matter.  The work is covered by the prime contract Statement of Work, paragraph 3.3, entitled Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy that states: The Contractor shall provide research, design and manufacturing capabilities for solar electric technologies (solar thermal and photovoltaic), wind energy, geothermal energy systems, industrial and transportation applications, fossil energy programs, electric power systems, hydrogen power technologies and battery systems for utilities and transportation.  

NOTE:  This action is awarded under prime contract modification no. A336 that recognizes WA no. 100003-20476-09 issued under Management and Operating Contract number DE-AC04-94AL85000.  This action is funded by Recovery Act dollars.

Place of Contract Performance: Sandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM

This opportunity was available only to MINACT, Inc. under contract number DOLJ06RA00007.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management on behalf of the Office of Job Corps has awarded a modification in the amount of $30,464 to the St. Louis Job Corps Center, operated by MINACT, Inc.  These funds are provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  The funding is within the not-to-exceed ceiling for CTST on this contract.

It would have been impracticable to use a fixed price contract to secure services of the kind or quality required for this modification, since the modification was to an existing Cost Plus Incentive Fee contract (Cost Reimbursement Contract).

The operator of the St. Louis center will utilize these funds to support additional career technical skills training opportunities to the students of the St. Louis Job Corps Center.
