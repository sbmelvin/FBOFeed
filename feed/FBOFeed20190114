AMC: 3/B ITEM DESCRIPTION (NOUN): ANNULAR BALL BEARINGS (TF34 ENGINE) NSN: 3110-01-198-4702 OP P/N: 5050T89P01 BEST ESTIMATED QUANTITY: 25 EA (MAX QTY: 171) DESTINATION: SW3211 REQUIRED DELIVERY: TBD 
QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS: NO EXPORT CONTROLLED: NO SURPLUS/OVERHAULED MATERIAL ALSO SOLICITED: NO 
PURCHASE HISTORY: SPRTA109G0004-0011; GENERAL ELECTRIC; 28 OCT 2009; 37 EA 
QUALIFIED SOURCE(S): SKF USA, INC (38443) 
In accordance with FAR 5.207(c)(16)(ii), all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, proposal, or quotation which shall be considered by the agency. 
This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors). 
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice. 
The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer. 
Authority: 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1). Justification: supplies required are available from only one or a limited number of responsible sources and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements. The proposed contract action is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one, or a limited number of sources under the authority of FAR 6.302. 
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed. 
While price will be a significant factor in the evaluation of offers, the final contract award decision may be based upon a combination of price, technical and past performance factors as detailed in the solicitation. An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel. When requested, the ombudsman will maintain strict confidentiality as to the source of the concern. The ombudsman does not participate in the evaluation of proposals or in the source selection process. Interested parties are invited to call the ombudsman at (405) 734-8241, facsimile (405) 734-8129. DO NOT CALL THIS NUMBER FOR SOLICITATION REQUESTS. 
Electronic procedures will be used for this solicitation. Hardcopies of the solicitation will not be sent from this office. The solicitation will be available for download at www.fbo.gov. Questions concerning this synopsis or subsequent solicitation can be directed to the buyer, Kevin Howe 405-734-8108, kevin.howe.1@us.af.mil.

<SOLNBR>W15QKN-19-R-0003
<CONTACT>Megan Cahill, Contract Specialist, Email megan.e.cahill.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-New Jersey (ACC-NJ), Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000, on behalf of the Office of the Project Manager Combat Ammunition Systems (PM CAS) located at Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey anticipates awarding a single competitive Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) base contract with four (4) option years, for a total of five (5) years for the 120mm M931 Full Range Practice FRPC and the M933A1 / M934A1 HE, and variants thereof Mortar Cartridges LAP to companies that are located within the U.S. and Canada under the authority of Title 10 USC 2304(c)(3), as implemented by FAR 6.302-3 - Industrial Mobilization; Engineering, Developmental, or Research Capability; or Expert Services. The award will be made utilizing the Best Value with Trade-off approach in accordance with FAR 15.101-1.
<p>The M931 FRPC is a 120mm low cost indirect fire mortar training cartridge which was developed to provide realistic training at reduced cost. The M931 FRPC was also developed to provide realistic training for the 120mm Battalion heavy mortar platoon at a production cost not to exceed 75% of the standard HE combat round. The M931 FRPC utilizes an M781 Point Detonating fuze which detonates upon impact and provides a flash bang and smoke signature for training. The M931 FRPC requires no special handling or storage requirements for personnel at ammunition supply points or ammunition depots. It requires no new knowledge or skills to operate and handle.</p>
<p>The M933A1 and M934A1 cartridges are fuzed HE rounds developed for use in the M120 (towed version), M121 (carrier-mounted version) Battalion Mortar Systems, and the Stryker Brigade Combat Team Mortar Carrier. They are intended for use against personnel and materiel targets, providing for fragmentation and blast effects. The M933A1 and M934A1 cartridges utilize a M783 PD/DLY Fuze and M734A1 MO Fuze, respectively. The cartridge detonates upon proper functioning of one (1) of the following selectable functioning modes: 120mm Proximity; Impact; or Delay. These 120mm HE cartridges are currently produced using a Comp-B and CH-6 explosive fill.</p>
<p>The components provided as Government Furnished Material (GFM) to the LAP contractor will be: M734A1 / M783 Fuzes, M781 Fuzes, 120mm HE Shell Body, 120mm FRPC Shell Body, M31 Fins Assemblies, M234A1 Propelling Charges, M1020 Ignition Cartridges, CH-6, Comp-B, and Fuze Adapters. The USG is currently certifying a Technical Data Package (TDP) for IMX-104 and PBXN-12 and may transition over to this explosive fill from Comp-B and CH-6. This transition will be completed via an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) after the basic contract award. The IMX-104 and PBXN-12 will also be provided as GFM to the LAP contractor.</p>
<p>The estimated maximum contract value will be $205,004,904. The estimated quantities for this five (5) year contract are 1,202,938 120mm M931 FRPC; 358,438 120mm M933A1 HE; and 150,783 120mm M934A1 HE. The associated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for the 120mm M931 FRPC and the M933A1 / M934A1 HE, and variants thereof Mortar Cartridges LAP is 332993. Contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database by accessing the SAM web site at http://www.sam.gov in order to be eligible for contract award.</p>
<p>The 120mm M931 FRPC and the M933A1 / M934A1 HE, and variants thereof Mortar Cartridges LAP will be built to Government Technical Data Packages (TDPs), which will be available upon release of the Request for Proposal (RFP). The TDPs are coded as Distribution Statement D (authorized distribution of technical documents to the Department of Defense (DoD) and U.S. DoD Contractors only). A fully executed DD Form 2345 and a completed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) will be required prior to receiving the TDPs. The point of contact for the TDP request will be Ms. Megan Cahill, megan.e.cahill.civ@mail.mil.</p>
<p>This is a Pre-Solicitation notice, and the Government anticipates the release of a formal RFP on or about 28 February 2019. Any information or exchanges between contractors and the Government concerning this notice are at no additional cost and/or obligation to the Government.</p>
<p>This notice does not constitute a formal RFP, nor is the Government obligated to issue an RFP. The point of contact for this requirement is Ms. Megan Cahill, megan.e.cahill.civ@mail.mil, ACC-NJ-CA, Bldg. 10, Picatinny Arsenal, NJ 07806-5000. All inquiries shall be made via e-mail only.

<div>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to award a firm fixed price sole source purchase order to Metron, Inc for service as outlined below:</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>CLIN 0001: The contractor shall provide and support the installation of two instances of Naval Simulation System (NSS) along with ObjectStore in accordance with the Statement of Work (See Section C).</div>

<div><br /></div>
<div>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, RI (NUWCDIVNPT) intends to award a Firm Fixed Price purchase order to Metron, Inc. on a sole source basis. NUWCDIVNPT requires Naval Simulation System (NSS), a mission-level model intended to focus on command, control, and communications (C3) for which an award to any other source would result both in an unacceptable impact to schedule that would result in unacceptable delays and a duplication of costs which could not be recovered through competition. NSS is already being used by other naval commands, and NUWCDIVNPT's use of NSS will allow greater interoperability across those commands. NSS will allow NUWCDIVNPT greater cost savings through collaborative efforts on model development, database developments, and software exchanges via NSS.  The amount of additional training and model development that an alternative would require would negate any price advantage gained through competition, and will not allow NUWCDIVNPT to meet FY19 deadlines.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>This is not a request for competitive proposals. All responsible sources may submit a capability statement which will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.</div>

This contract action will be negotiated as sole source, due to Puglia being the only responsible source for performance of the required services. Puglia is currently under contract to perform maintenance, repair and preservation of the IX-536. Due to unforeseen conditions below the waterline of the vessel, a complete blast and preservation of the hull/freeboard is now required vice the originally anticipated touch-up preservation; the IX-536 requires emergent repair to ensure timely completion of a permanent preservation system and zinc replacement. Failure to complete the requirement expeditiously would jeopardize the ability of the vessel to support critical Navy operations, and award of these services to any other source would result in an unacceptable delay in fulfilling the agency's requirements.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />IX-536 Vessel Characteristics:<br /></span>Length: 177 FT<br />Width: 76 FT<br />Age: 27 Years<br />Hull Type: Steel<br />Draft: 5 FT<br />Full Displacement: 1680 L Tons<br />Light Load: 1653 L Tons<br /><br /><br />This contract action will be accomplished under the existing contract for the maintenance, repair and preservation of the IX-536, contract N4523A19C1050.<br /><br /><br />The anticipated award date is 4 February 2019.

<DESC>INTRODUCTION
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Program Contracting Activity Central (PCAC) anticipates soliciting quotations and subsequently awarding a Firm-Fixed-Price contract for Exam Tables and Chairs for the VA Northern California Health Care System (VANCHCS).  Acquisition of these items is part of the initial outfitting and activation of the new Chico VA Clinic in Chico, CA.

DESCRIPTION
A contract is needed for the Chico VA Clinic for below listed brand name or equal equipment.

SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS/MANUFACTURERS CUTSHEETS
The contractor will be required to include manufacturer cut-sheets/specifications for items quoted.

**See attached STATEMENT OF WORK (SOW)


ADMINISTRATIVE
The solicitation will be issued as a  Request for Quote  (RFQ) conducted in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Parts 12 and 13. The solicitation will be advertised as 100% set-aside for Small Business.  The applicable NAICS code is 339112.   The solicitation will be issued on or about December 3, 2018 for approximately seven (7) calendar days.  Offerors will be required to submit their quotes electronically via email. 

Products that are purchased outside of our authorized distributor network on the gray market generate a number of concerns such as: counterfeit or adulterated devices, inadequate storage conditions, tracking issues in case of a recall, loss of warrantee, and most importantly patient safety.  In some instances unauthorized distributors procure products from an authorized distributor for resale. However, authorized distributors purchase products at list price, and the unauthorized distributors are reselling the product at a price point below list price, which raises questions about product sourcing.

The solicitation will include the requirement that responders provide an authorized distributor letter that states the responder is an authorized dealer/distributor of the OEM for the items being procured such that all product warranties and service and/or preventative maintenance agreements transfer to the VA and will be honored by the OEM or guarantees that the OEM gives authorization to the responder to fulfill all warranty, service, and/or preventative maintenance obligations for the equipment.  Vendors who are unable to supply proof of authorized dealer or distributorship will not be considered for award.

This notice is not a request for competitive offers.  Questions of a technical nature will not be answered as part of this notice; however, all general questions may be submitted in writing to the issuing office via email at jacquelyn.wise@va.gov AND michelle.rhodes@va.gov.   Telephone calls will not be accepted.  The VA reserves the right to use only Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), via the internet, to provide notification of any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.  It is the contractor s responsibility to view FBO daily for any amendments to this notice and the subsequent issuance of the solicitation.

<DESC>THIS REQUEST FOR INFORMATION IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP). IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.
<p>The 763 SCONS is seeking information from potential sources capable of performing AE services for the Department of Defense (DoD). The required AE services will include the commercial aircraft, the aircraft operating aircrew, maintenance, and insurance (ACMI) and support for patient special needs. Aeromedical Evacuation services are required for missions less than a range of 3,500 nautical miles (nm) and missions with a range beyond 3,500 nm; however, the greatest need is for missions within CONUS (less than 3,500 nm). Carriers must be Civil Airlift Review Board (CARB) certified. Carriers that are not Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF) eligible, as determined by the DOD Commercial Airlift Division (HQ AMC/A3B), will be issued a "CRAF Letter of Technical Ineligibility". Commercial AE airlift services are restricted to United States (US) flag carriers. Commercial AE missions will be flown during periods of conflict, disaster relief, and peacetime. Commercial sustainment AE missions will occur at a tempo significantly less than that during conflict. Commercial AE missions will not operate into, through, or out of any declared combat, hostile threat or war zone. Commercial AE missions will be required to transport both ambulatory and litter patients. Some patients may require critical care treatment during commercial AE airlift. The ratio of litter to ambulatory patients is 75% to 25% for the purposes of this posting. Patients will be attended by US military AE crews, led by a Medical Crew Director (MCD). Critical care patients will be attended by a Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT). Commercial AE services will also be used to position AE crews for force posturing. Commercial AE capability will be exercised regularly by USTRANSCOM and HQ AMC to measure readiness. See Attachment 1 for a list of additional technical capabilities.</p>

<DESC>Statement of Work (SOW) 
Reusable Medical Equipment (Instrument) Sharpening and Repair

Background
The VHA Directive 1116(2),  Sterile Processing Service (SPS)  requires that SPS must have a systematic plan to assess and retire malfunctioning instrumentation by utilizing a company or intra-facility service that is certified to refurbish instrumentation.  Currently there is no service located within the facility that has the knowledge and training to inspect, sharpen and perform all steps in the refurbishing process.   SPS does not have a contract with any refurbishing company at this time.  The future goal is to acquire a service contract so be in compliance with the VHA Directive 1116(2).  The goal and vision for the future is to receive recommendations for surgical instrument replacements, maintenance data, and quality assurance monitoring which will provide SPS with essential information to develop an annual budget for replacement instruments.

Objectives
The purpose of this project is to obtain a contract with a company that provides on-site refurbishing of reusable medical equipment and if necessary, off-site repairs for instruments that require extensive repairs. By obtaining a service of this type, instruments will be inspected, repaired, sharpened, lubricated, and marked unrepairable during scheduled bi-weekly visits.   In doing so, instrumentation used by James J. Peters VAMC providers will be maintained in good working condition to enhance positive patient outcomes during ambulatory and surgical procedures.  Furthermore, the JJP Sterile Processing Service will be able to be compliant with the VHA Directive 1116(2).  

Period of Performance: Date of award base plus (+) Four (4) 12 months option year.
 

Place of Performance / Place of Delivery
The contractor shall perform services on-site at the James J. Peters VAMC.  Instruments will be retrieved by the contractor and returned by the contractor on the same day.  In the event that an instrument has extensive damage and cannot be repaired on-site, the contracting officer or designee must approve off-site repairs which may require a second level approval from a clinical manager or supervisor. If approved, the contractor will provide within 3 business days a description of the defect, repair options, cost, and estimated time repair will be completed.  Contracting officer or designee will determine whether to pursue off-site repair option or return instrument without repair. All instruments will be returned to the James J. Peters VAMC via the warehouse.   Under no circumstance will the contractor retain VA property. 


Scope or Tasks (for services)
The contractor shall perform onsite service which will include the following: 

Inspection and repair of rigid containers and cassettes
Inspection, sharpening, and repair of various stainless-steel instruments, power equipment repair, pneumatic equipment repair, power equipment battery service, light cables, fiberoptic retractors, phaco handpieces, and laparoscopic instruments
Replace damaged instrument parts with new, medical grade parts
Electrosurgical instrument re-insulation
Loaner equipment available while instruments are being repaired off-site 
Removal of instrument indicator tape
Weekend sterilizer and loading cart annual cleaning 
Case cart repair
The contractor shall coordinate specific dates for maintenance and repairs with the contracting officer or designee.  In general, services will be scheduled bi-weekly, but dates for such services may vary depending on the type of procedures scheduled.  Notification and confirmation for maintenance and repairs must be coordinated one week prior to the date requested

Government-Furnished Property, Material, Equipment, or Information (GFP, GFM, GFE, or GFI)
No Government-furnished property will be provided to the contractor. . This includes all Government-furnished property, such as Government-furnished material, equipment, or information. All equipment and supplies used under the terms of this contract will be the provided by and the responsibility of the contractor.

Security
Contractor shall be required to complete a security clearance with the VA Police. 

An ID badge will be issued by the VA Police which must be presented by all contractors at the VA entrance security check points. The issued badge is designated for official pick-up and deliveries of surgical instruments and trays.  ID badge must be worn at all times above the waist, in front, with the face of the card visible. It is the responsibility of the contracting officer or designee to verify that the vendor has a temporary identification badge.  If not, they are to be escorted to the VA Police and Security office.  Once issued a temporary identification badge, the contractor will be escorted by the contracting officer or designee to SPS.   

Contractor s mobile unit/van shall be properly label with the company logo and registered with the VA Police Department and park in designated areas for service.

Upon arrival to the Sterile Processing Service, the contractor will be required to sign the sign-in sheet located outside of the preparation room (GA13A). 

The contactor will not have access to VA sensitive information. 



Any Additional Requirements Unique to the Solicitation.
All trays and single items will be listed by contractor for accountability.  The contractor will tag or label completed trays to identify the instrument inspection date. These instruments must be labeled, marked, or separated to prevent reuse.   A comprehensive maintenance report which includes a description of the instruments refurbished, price, and specific defect must be provided within 3 business days.
   
The contractor shall have the capabilities to maintain and repair delicate and micro instrumentation. These instruments may include such items as Ophthalmology, Ear Nose & Throat, and Vascular reusable medical equipment.

In the event that an instrument is found to be defective beyond the capabilities of the mobile service, or in the event an instrument requires repair or sharpening and cannot wait until the bi-weekly service period, it may become necessary for the government to ship items to the contractor for service or repair.

SPS staff will inspect 100% of instruments serviced using standard tools designed for the testing of surgical instrumentation. Any instruments in which after testing are found to be of poor quality will be documented in writing and returned to the contractor for repair.  The contractor will not bill for items that have not been repaired to acceptable standards

<DESC><p><br /><br />Computerized Labeling Review Tool: Request for Information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />1.0 Purpose</p>
<p>This Request for Information (RFI) is being issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 10, Market Research. It is for information, planning and market research purposes only and shall not be construed as either a solicitation or obligation on the part of the FDA or its Centers. The purpose of this RFI is to broaden FDA's understanding of the market's capability, either as solutions requiring potential development of a technology or existing commercially-available applications, to provide a Computerized Labeling Review Tool that uses computer programming and artificial intelligence technology to automate portions of the drug product labeling review process used by the Division of Medication Error Prevention and Analysis (DMEPA), in the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology (OSE), CDER/FDA.</p>
<p>FDA will not award a contract based on responses nor otherwise pay for the preparation of any information submitted or FDA's use of such information. Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Federal Government to form a binding contract. Information obtained because of this notice may be used by the FDA for program planning on a non-attribution basis.<br />Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this notice. Responses will be reviewed only by FDA personnel and will be held in a confidential manner.</p>
<p>Requests for a solicitation will not receive a response.</p>
<p>Notice to Small Businesses: One purpose of this RFI/Sources Sought Notice is to seek declarations of technical capabilities and various information, data, and materials from qualified small business concerns [including 8A Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses (SDB), Woman-owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Small Businesses, Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-owned Small Businesses (SDVOSB)]. FDA intends to provide maximum practicable opportunities in its acquisitions to small business, veteran-owned small business, service-disabled veteran-owned small business, HUBZone small business, and small disadvantaged business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&emsp;<br />2.0 Background</p>
<p>DMEPA is the scientific lead for medication error prevention and analysis for CDER-regulated drug products. DMEPA's responsibilities include premarket and postmarket reviews of drug product labeling (e.g., container labels, carton labeling, prescribing information, Medication Guides, and Instructions for Use) to minimize the risk of medication errors. An overview of DMEPA's missions and responsibilities can be found on the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/medicationerrors/.</p>
<p>As part of the drug product labeling review process, DMEPA manually evaluates proposed drug product labeling submitted by applicants, sponsors, or manufacturers against applicable regulations, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards, FDA guidance for industry, best practices promoted by patient safety organizations, and experience gained through FDA's postmarket surveillance program for medication errors. This process helps to identify potential areas of the labeling that may contribute to medication errors, ensure drug products meet regulatory requirements, and standardize DMEPA labeling reviews across multiple types of drug products. If DMEPA's labeling review identifies potential deficiencies or inconsistences, then the drug product applicant, sponsor, or manufacturer is notified to consider revisions and resubmit the labeling.</p>
<p>Drug product labeling reviews are labor- and time-intensive; analysts are required to consider current regulations, standards, guidance, and best practices for medication error prevention; identify and evaluate potential look-alike features with marketed products; and track labeling revisions. Therefore, FDA anticipates the need to computerize the labeling review process, which will increase efficiency, and standardization and harmonization across multiple product types.<br />3.0 Technical Information</p>
<p>Drug product applicants, sponsors, and manufacturers submit proposed labeling (e.g., container labels, carton labeling, prescribing information, Medication Guides, and Instructions for Use) electronically to FDA using various file formats (e.g., Word, PDF, XML, JPEG). The submitted proposed labeling contains confidential and proprietary information. Following FDA approval of a drug product, the final (approved) labeling is available to the public on the FDA website (e.g., https://labels.fda.gov/), and the electronic labeling files can be downloaded from the National Library of Medicine's DailyMed website (https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/index.cfm).</p>
<p>Applicable regulations, standards, guidances, and best practices for medication error prevention include: Code of Federal Regulations-Title 21 (available from: https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text- idx?SID=3ee286332416f26a91d9e6d786a604ab&amp;mc=true&amp;tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title21/21tab_02.tpl), USP labeling and packaging standards (available from https://www.uspnf.com/), FDA guidance for industry on medication error prevention (available from http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/default.htm), and best practices from patient safety organizations, including the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (available from: https://www.ismp.org/).<br />4.0 Information Requested</p>
<p>FDA anticipates the need to increase the efficiency, and standardization and harmonization of DMEPA's labeling reviews across multiple product types. One such need is a tool that incorporates computer programming and artificial intelligence to automate portions of DMEPA's manual labeling review process. DMEPA safety evaluators would apply the tool to proposed drug product labeling submitted to FDA by applicants, sponsors, and manufacturers. The tool would analyze the proposed labeling for error-prone abbreviations, look-alike labeling for currently marketed products, product strength differentiation, prominence of the product name, appropriate packaging, presence of a barcode and National Drug Code (NDC) number, and other features in accordance with applicable regulations, standards, FDA guidance for industry, and best practices promoted by patient safety organizations. The tool would also generate a report of the review findings, including identification of labeling areas that are acceptable, deficient or inconsistent, and uncertain (tool was unable to assess).</p>
<p>5.0 Anticipated High-Level Functionalities and Requirements</p>
<p>The FDA anticipates the need for a computerized labeling tool that is capable of computerizing DMEPA's manual review process to increase efficiency, and enhance standardization and harmonization across multiple drug product types as follows:</p>
<p>1. Allow the user to upload labeling submitted in various file formats, including Word, PDF, CSV, XML and JPEG or other image files.<br />2. Allow the user to name and organize submitted files in folders within the tool (e.g., folder named 'NDA 12345 Drug A' contains the submitted container labels, prescribing information, and carton labeling for Drug A).<br />3. Allow document check-in and check-out functionality, retain versions, and provide multiple users review and edit features of the labeling materials.<br />4. Allow the user to select one or more labeling materials for review (e.g., folder contains the container label, carton labeling, and prescribing information, but the user wants to select only the container label for review).<br />5. Allow the user to select the entire or specific section(s) of the prescribing information for review (e.g., the prescribing information contains 17 sections, but the user will review only sections 2 (DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and 16 (HOW SUPPLIED)).<br />6. Allow the user to apply the entire or portions of the tool (e.g., the user will apply only the portion of the tool related to the NDC number and barcode regulations).<br />7. Allow the user to generate a report of the labeling review findings in a file format that allows the user to copy and paste the findings into a separate Word or pdf document. The tool shall also highlight deficiencies or inconsistencies in the reviewed labeling (e.g., yellow-highlight error- prone abbreviations in the prescribing information that were identified by the tool).<br />8. Allow the user to upload revised labeling, perform an additional labeling, and generate a data comparison report that compares the revised labeling with the initial or previously submitted labeling.<br />9. Allow the use of computer programming, algorithms, and machine learning as needed to perform labeling reviews.<br />10. Incorporate revisions based on updates to regulations, standards, guidance, best practices, and experience gained through postmarketing surveillance for medication errors.<br />11. Identify look alike container labels or carton labeling from a repository of labeling.<br />12. Run from a cloud computing environment.<br />13. Provide robust security enable environment to protect proprietary and confidential information.<br />14. Enable with API capabilities to connect with other potential data sources for comparison.</p>

<p><br />Appendix A. Use Case - Computerized Labeling Review Tool for Drug Product Reviews</p>
<p>A company submits a new drug application for an injectable drug product. The application includes the proposed prescribing information in both a Word file and XML file, and images of the proposed carton label and container labeling in a pdf file.</p>
<p>The DMEPA safety analyst downloads the files containing the proposed prescribing information and images of the container label and carton labeling. The analyst reviews the prescribing information and images against regulations, standards, guidance documents, postmarket medication error cases submitted to FAERS, and best practices to identify proposed content that may contribute to medication errors (e.g., error prone abbreviations, unclear preparation and dosing instructions, discordant product strength and units of measure, confusing packaging, lack of prominence for the product name, missing storage information, no differentiation for product strengths, missing or uninterpretable lot numbers, National Drug Code [NDC] numbers or linear barcodes). The analyst also compares the proposed container label and carton labeling against currently marketed products to avoid look alike labeling that may contribute to medication errors.</p>
<p>After reviewing the proposed prescribing information and images of the container label and carton labeling, the analyst lists the identified deficiencies and inconsistencies, and provides written recommendations to the company. The company then considers DMEPA's recommendations and submits revised labeling to address the deficiencies and inconsistencies. The analyst compares the revised labeling with the original or previously submitted labeling, reviews the revised labeling, and notifies the company if the revised labeling is acceptable or if additional revisions are needed.</p>
<p>DMEPA management periodically runs a report that lists identified labeling deficiencies or inconsistencies, analyst recommendations, and other metrics for the reporting period, and determines if revisions should be made to regulations, standards, guidance documents, or the labeling review process.</p>

Only electronic responses to this RFI will be accepted.  The Government will not pay for any time expended or information submitted in response to this RFI.  Eligibility in participating in a future acquisition does not depend upon a response to this RFI.

BACKGROUND 

VBA is one of three (3) administrations comprising the VA:  Veteran Health Administration (VHA), National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and VBA.  VBA is responsible for administering and delivering an array of federally authorized benefits and services to eligible Veterans and their dependents and survivors.  VBA has annual expenditures over $90 billion.
VBA developed the Veterans Benefits Management System (VBMS), a paperless claims processing system that greatly reduces the time required to establish, develop, decide, and pay claims.  The system replaces what was once a largely manual and paper-based process that had inherent bottlenecks and inefficiencies that led to processing delays and errors.  Ongoing development of and continued enhancements to VBMS support VBA s progression towards an automated processing environment.
To continuously improve benefits processing efficiency and cycle-time, VBA has partnered with industry leaders to provide a host of contracted services.  Some of those services include:
File Bank Extraction Services to reduce VBA s physical footprint, improving processing time and saving taxpayer dollars.
Document Conversion Services to populate veteran eFolders in VBMS with images previously stored in paper claims folders.
Digitized Mail Handling Services to provide field resources an electronic method for reviewing and processing mail previously accomplished in paper.
Records Management Services to provide storage for paper previously stored within VA facilities.
Centralized Benefits Communications Management supporting the centralization of all printing and mailing, which all VA regional offices previously did individually, and improving productivity and streamlining correspondence with Veterans on their claims.
Private Medical Records Retrieval Services supporting the reduction in the amount of time spent waiting for a Private Healthcare Provider to send medical records to VBA.
VBA anticipates continuing, enhancing and expanding the above referenced services through contractor support by means of ultimately competing this work among highly qualified and capable contractors.  However, this RFI does not represent a solicitation nor is it a guarantee of a future solicitation.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Fecal Incontinence Products. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO North is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Fecal Incontinence Products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Fecal Incontinence Products in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Fecal Incontinence Products will be established approximately May 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately June 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Fecal Incontinence Products. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Fecal Incontinence Products.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Fecal Incontinence Products. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $281,292. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Two items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100% ($281,292) of the total volume in sales $281,292. The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL. Vendors must provide responses to this Sources Sought notification via the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.</strong><br />1. Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4. Vendor must have a government issued Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code assigned for products contained within the specific product group or be in the process of obtaining one. Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification. Vendor must submit the following information via QSL FBO Package Worksheet for each offered product: Full item description, Distributor Part Number, Manufacturer Part Number, Manufacturer Name, Number of eaches in Unit of Sale, and country of origin. Only ONE Vendor Part Number (PN) should be provided for each item/sample. Vendor must send the same part number(s) for evaluation(s) as provided in response to this QSL FBO announcement and as noted in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet.<br /><strong><br />Required Products / Annual Usage in Units</strong> /<br />5.1 FECAL COLLECTION BAGS WITH CONNECTOR, MINIMUM BAG CAPACITY 1 LITER ,WITH GRADUATION MARKINGS / 3,520 /<br />5.2 INDWELLING FECAL INCONTINENCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM / 968 /<br /><br />6.

<DESC><strong>The Defense Health Agency (DHA) Medical Logistics (MEDLOG) Division Medical Materiel Enterprise Standardization Office (MMESO) and the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Troop Support Medical Prime Vendor (PV) Program announce a Sources Sought notification for the creation of a Qualified Suppliers Listing (QSL) for Specimen Container, Peel Pack. This is not a request for a price quote. The MMESO DHA is the lead MMESO for this project.<br /></strong><br />These Specimen Container, Peel Pack products are for purchase by the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) of the Military Health System (MHS) and for the operational assemblages of the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Naval Expeditionary Medical Support Command (NEMSCOM) and managed regionally by MMESOs North, South, West, Pacific and Europe, hereafter referred to as MMESOs. For information regarding DLA Troop Support Medical's PV program please access the DMMOnline web site at https://www.medical.dla.mil.<br /><br />This Sources Sought notification is intended to solicit information and products for evaluation in order to create a QSL for Specimen Container, Peel Pack in accordance with (IAW) FAR 9.2. The QSL for Specimen Container, Peel Pack will be established approximately June 2019 and is anticipated to be the basis of a Standardization Action. All medical consumable items on this QSL must be on a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) for the DLA Troop Support Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor (MSPV) Program. All participating vendors must complete the registration in the DAPA Management System (DMS) at https://www.medical.dla.mil/Portal/DapaMS/DapaMS.aspx and include either their DAPA number or their Defense Medical Materiel (DMM) number as part of their FBO worksheet submission. Receiving a DMM number allows access to the DMS and is the first step to becoming a DAPA holder. DAPA holders must be prepared to ship items to the PVs, so that the PVs may carry inventory and MTFs may designate items as usage; therefore, standardized items may not be coded in the DMS as "drop ship only." Note: It is recommended that new participants contact each PV prior to adding items to DAPA, in order to gain a full understanding of the PV's requirements and any potential costs associated with PV handling of those items.<br /><br />If you qualify as a vendor on the QSL, you will then be invited, approximately July 2019, to submit pricing quotes and a separate screenshot of your submitted DAPA Log submission or existing DAPA base uncommitted pricing for all required items to the MMESO POCs. Both pricing quotes and substantiating DMS documentation will be required for eligibility to enter into an Incentive Agreement (IA) for Specimen Container, Peel Pack. Only those vendors with an established DAPA will be eligible to enter into the subsequent IA. The Government reserves the right to standardize or not standardize on Specimen Container, Peel Pack.<br /><br />The MSPV Program requires that all items be manufactured in a Trade Agreements Act (TAA) Compliant Country (see DFARS 252.225-7020 AND 252.225-7021), unless it is determined that no functionally equivalent item is available from a compliant source. To be eligible for inclusion in the proposed QSL, all vendors are required to provide country of origin information in the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. In addition, according to the DAPA Terms and Conditions, vendors must complete the DAPA TAA Certification for each item quoted. If a quoted item is a TAA Non-Compliant End Product, the Government can use this information to determine whether or not a non-availability determination exists or if the Government will make a non-availability determination for the item. Unless a non-availability determination is made or a waiver is obtained, TAA Non-Compliant Country End Products cannot be added to the QSL and/or DAPA. Any questions concerning TAA may be directed to Donna Raday at DLA Troop Support, donna.raday@dla.mil, 215-737-7885.<br /><br />A. Products &amp; Performance Required<br />The MMESOs are seeking product line items in the category of Specimen Container, Peel Pack. Within the MHS MTFs and operational procurement this product line has an estimated annual sales volume of $408,513. This forecast is based on historical usage data during a recent 12-month period. Three items are required for addition to the QSL and account for 100 % ($408,513) of the total volume in sales $408,513. The specifications for this project are shown in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below.<br /><br />B. Instructions to Vendors<br />Vendors interested in qualifying for inclusion in the QSL must respond to this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification by sending the appropriate FBO worksheet and all supporting documentation via e-mail to the lead MMESO POCs below. The vendor's submission must include all detailed information requested in the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL" section below and must also include: (1) Company name and address; (2) Company POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, and E-mail address); (3) Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code; (4) Identification of the Sources Sought notification to which the vendor is responding, and (5) DAPA or DMM number. Due to the potential for e-mail to be lost in transmission, from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the lead MMESO that their e-mail submission has arrived. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date and time. As part of the "Requirements to Qualify for QSL," vendors must complete and submit the QSL FBO Package Worksheet. Any vendor experiencing difficulty opening the Worksheet may contact the MMESO POCs. The MMESO POC will provide a Worksheet copy via an alternate method (fax, e-mail or hard copy).<br /><strong><br />Vendors that do not meet the deadline of COB 5:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on the response date above for this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification will not be included in the lead MMESO's review to establish the QSL and thus will not be able to participate in the subsequent Standardization Action.<br /></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br />Requirements to Qualify for QSL</span><br />The requirements for this product line are outlined below. Complete answers and all supporting documentation must be provided with the vendor's submittal by the response date stated in this QSL FBO Sources Sought notification. <strong>A vendor who does not meet all of these requirements or who does not submit documentation to support these requirements as requested will not be qualified for the QSL.

Vendor must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the product line listed. Vendor must provide their DAPA number or provide date of application and DMM number proving access to the DMS, as the subsequent Standardization Action requires vendors to have all required items on DAPA.<br />2. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor CARDINAL HEALTH, or must work with CARDINAL HEALTH to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />3. Vendor must have an agreement with the current DoD Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor OWENS &amp; MINOR, or must work with OWENS &amp; MINOR to initiate an agreement, as standardized items from this QSL will be distributed via the MSPV program.<br />4.

Vendors must validate that their account is Active in the System for Award Management (SAM) and provide CAGE Code. Vendors in the process of obtaining a CAGE Code must provide documentation to support that they have registered in SAM. Vendors without a CAGE Code and/or a SAM account will not be considered for participation in the subsequent Standardization Action. See https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/. <br />5. <strong>Vendor quoted products shall be TAA compliant. End-items quoted shall be manufactured or substantially transformed either in the U.S. or in Designated or Qualifying countries, unless source non-availability determination is made. Therefore, the vendor at the item level must provide country of origin for all required items and any optional items offered.</strong> Vendor must provide product catalog &amp; literature for any items offered in response to this Sources Sought notification.

The rights to use the data needed to purchase this part from additional source(s) are not owned by the Government and cannot be purchased, developed, or otherwise obtained. It is uneconomical to reverse engineer this part. The subject item requires Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to support acquisition via full and open competition. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award can not be delayed pending approval of a new source, If you are not an approved source, you must submit, together with your proposal, the information detailed in the https://www.neco.navy.mil/sar.aspx NAVSUP source approval request at www.navsup.navy.mil.
If your request for source approval is currently being evaluated at NAVSUP WSS, submit with your offer a copy of the cover letter which was forwarded with your request for source approval. If evaluation of a source approval request submitted can not be processed in time and/or approval requirements preclude the availability to obtain subject items in time to meet Government requirements, award of the subject requirement may continue based on fleet support needs.

IT CONTRACT SECURITY (MARCH 12, 2010)
VA INFORMATION AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY/PRIVACY

GENERAL

Contractors, contractor personnel, subcontractors, and subcontractor personnel shall be subject to the same Federal laws, regulations, standards, and VA Directives and Handbooks as VA and VA personnel regarding information and information system security.

VA INFORMATION CUSTODIAL LANGUAGE

Information made available to the contractor or subcontractor by VA for the performance or administration of this contract or information developed by the contractor/subcontractor in performance or administration of the contract shall be used only for those purposes and shall not be used in any other way without the prior written agreement of the VA. This clause expressly limits the contractor/subcontractor's rights to use data as described in Rights in Data
- General, FAR 52.227-14(d) (1).

VA information should not be co-mingled, if possible, with any other data on the contractors/subcontractor s information systems or media storage systems in order to ensure VA requirements related to data protection and media sanitization can be met. If co-mingling must be allowed to meet the requirements of the business need, the contractor must ensure that VA s information is returned to the VA or destroyed in accordance with VA s sanitization requirements.  VA reserves the right to conduct on site inspections of contractor and subcontractor IT resources to ensure data security controls, separation of data and job duties, and destruction/media sanitization procedures are in compliance with VA directive requirements.

Prior to termination or completion of this contract, contractor/subcontractor must not destroy information received from VA, or gathered/created by the contractor in the course of performing this contract without prior written approval by the VA. Any data destruction done on behalf of VA by a contractor/subcontractor must be done in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) requirements as outlined in VA Directive 6300, Records and Information Management and its Handbook 6300.1 Records Management Procedures, applicable VA Records Control Schedules, and VA Handbook 6500.1, Electronic Media Sanitization.  Self-certification by the contractor that the data destruction requirements above have been met must be sent to the VA Contracting Officer within 30 days of termination of the contract.

The contractor/subcontractor must receive, gather, store, back up, maintain, use, disclose and dispose of VA information only in compliance with the terms of the contract and applicable Federal and VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies.  If Federal or VA information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies become applicable to the VA information or information systems after execution of the contract, or if NIST issues or updates applicable FIPS or Special Publications (SP) after execution of this contract, the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to implement the information confidentiality and security laws, regulations and policies in this contract.

The contractor/subcontractor shall not make copies of VA information except as authorized and necessary to perform the terms of the agreement or to preserve electronic information stored on contractor/subcontractor electronic storage media for restoration in case any electronic equipment or data used by the contractor/subcontractor needs to be restored to an operating state.  If copies are made for restoration purposes, after the restoration is complete, the copies must be appropriately destroyed.

If VA determines that the contractor has violated any of the information confidentiality, privacy, and security provisions of the contract, it shall be sufficient grounds for VA to withhold  payment to the contractor or third party or terminate the contract for default or terminate for cause under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12.

If a VHA contract is terminated for cause, the associated BAA must also be terminated and appropriate actions taken in accordance with VHA Handbook 1600.01, Business Associate Agreements.  Absent an agreement to use or disclose protected health information, there is no business associate relationship.

The contractor/subcontractor must store, transport, or transmit VA sensitive information in an encrypted form, using VA-approved encryption tools that are, at a minimum, FIPS 140-2 validated.

The contractor/subcontractor s firewall and Web services security controls, if applicable, shall meet or exceed VA s minimum requirements. VA Configuration Guidelines are available upon request.

Except for uses and disclosures of VA information authorized by this contract for performance of the contract, the contractor/subcontractor may use and disclose VA information only in two other situations: (i) in response to a qualifying order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) with VA s prior written approval.  The contractor/subcontractor must refer all requests for, demands for production of, or inquiries about, VA information and information systems to the VA contracting officer for response.


Notwithstanding the provision above, the contractor/subcontractor shall not release VA records protected by Title 38 U.S.C. 5705, confidentiality of medical quality assurance records and/or Title 38 U.S.C. 7332, confidentiality of certain health records pertaining to drug addiction, sickle cell anemia, alcoholism or alcohol abuse, or infection with human immunodeficiency virus.  If the contractor/subcontractor is in receipt of a court order or other requests for the above mentioned information, that contractor/subcontractor shall immediately refer such court orders or other requests to the VA contracting officer for response.

For service that involves the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information but does not require C&A or an MOU-ISA for system interconnection, the contractor/subcontractor must complete a Contractor Security Control Assessment (CSCA) on a yearly basis and provide it to the COTR.
SECURITY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

The term  security incident  means an event that has, or could have, resulted in unauthorized access to, loss or damage to VA assets, or sensitive information, or an action that breaches VA security procedures. The contractor/subcontractor shall immediately notify the COTR and simultaneously, the designated ISO and Privacy Officer for the contract of any known or suspected security/privacy incidents, or any unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including that contained in system(s) to which the contractor/subcontractor has access.

To the extent known by the contractor/subcontractor, the contractor/subcontractor s notice to VA shall identify the information involved, the circumstances surrounding the incident (including to whom, how, when, and where the VA information or assets were placed at risk or compromised), and any other information that the contractor/subcontractor considers relevant.

With respect to unsecured protected health information, the business associate is deemed to have discovered a data breach when the business associate knew or should have known of a breach of such information. Upon discovery, the business associate must notify the covered entity of the breach.  Notifications need to be made in accordance with the executed business associate agreement.

In instances of theft or break-in or other criminal activity, the contractor/subcontractor must concurrently report the incident to the appropriate law enforcement entity (or entities) of jurisdiction, including the VA OIG and Security and Law Enforcement. The contractor, its employees, and its subcontractors and their employees shall cooperate with VA and any law enforcement authority responsible for the investigation and prosecution of any possible criminal law violation(s) associated with any incident. The contractor/subcontractor shall cooperate with VA in any civil litigation to recover VA information, obtain monetary or other compensation from a third party for damages arising from any incident, or obtain injunctive relief against any third party arising from, or related to, the incident.

LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH

Consistent with the requirements of 38 U.S.C. §5725, a contract may require access to sensitive personal information. If so, the contractor is liable to VA for liquidated damages in the event of a data breach or privacy incident involving any SPI the contractor/subcontractor processes or maintains under this contract.

The contractor/subcontractor shall provide notice to VA of a  security incident  as set forth in the Security Incident Investigation section above.  Upon such notification, VA must secure from a non-Department entity or the VA Office of Inspector General an independent risk analysis of the data breach to determine the level of risk associated with the data breach for the potential misuse of any sensitive personal information involved in the data breach. The term 'data breach' means the loss, theft, or other unauthorized access, or any access other than that incidental to the scope of employment, to data containing sensitive personal information, in electronic or printed form, that results in the potential compromise of the confidentiality or integrity of the data.  Contractor shall fully cooperate with the entity performing the risk analysis.  Failure to cooperate may be deemed a material breach and grounds for contract termination.

Each risk analysis shall address all relevant information concerning the data breach, including the following:

Nature of the event (loss, theft, unauthorized access);

Description of the event, including:

date of occurrence;

data elements involved, including any PII, such as full name, social security number, date of birth, home address, account number, disability code;

Number of individuals affected or potentially affected;

Names of individuals or groups affected or potentially affected;

Ease of logical data access to the lost, stolen or improperly accessed data in light of the degree of protection for the data, e.g., unencrypted, plain text;

Amount of time the data has been out of VA control;

The likelihood that the sensitive personal information will or has been compromised (made accessible to and usable by unauthorized persons);

Known misuses of data containing sensitive personal information, if any;

Assessment of the potential harm to the affected individuals;

Data breach analysis as outlined in 6500.2 Handbook, Management of Security and Privacy Incidents, as appropriate; and

Whether credit protection services may assist record subjects in avoiding or mitigating the results of identity theft based on the sensitive personal information that may have been compromised.

Based on the determinations of the independent risk analysis, the contractor shall be responsible for paying to the VA liquidated damages in the amount of $37.50  per affected individual to cover the cost of providing credit protection services to affected individuals consisting of the following:

Notification;

One year of credit monitoring services consisting of automatic daily monitoring of at least 3 relevant credit bureau reports;

Data breach analysis;

Fraud resolution services, including writing dispute letters, initiating fraud alerts and credit freezes, to assist affected individuals to bring matters to resolution;

One year of identity theft insurance with $20,000.00 coverage at $0 deductible; and

Necessary legal expenses the subjects may incur to repair falsified or damaged credit records, histories, or financial affairs.

TRAINING

All contractor employees and subcontractor employees requiring access to VA information and VA information systems shall complete the following before being granted access to VA information and its systems:

Sign and acknowledge (either manually or electronically) understanding of and responsibilities for compliance with the  Contractor Rules of Behavior, Appendix E relating to access to VA information and information systems;

proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer

level possible before considering the more formal process described below.

Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

Failure to comply with the below terms and conditions may result in offer being determined as non-responsive.<BR>In responding to this request for quote, you must provide the manufacturer's
name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the
following salient characteristics (insert salient characteristics). If your
response does not contain all of the required information called out in this
notice, your quote will be determined nonresponsive and will not be

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the

that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution. Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command

<p><br />SCHEDULE/REQUIREMENT<br />CLIN 0001<br />Description:&nbsp;&nbsp;Provide all Labor, Material and Equipment for Services to Create Captions and Transcripts for 94 Videos Containing 3,847 Minutes in Accordance with the Attached Statement of Work<br />Quanity:&nbsp; &nbsp;1<br />Unit:&nbsp;&nbsp;JB<br />Price:&nbsp;&nbsp; $_______________</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Statement of Work<br />Video Captioning <br />Purpose: Create captions and transcripts to video content (mp4 files) Video Captions for 94 videos containing 3,847 minutes that will be posted on geodesy.noaa.gov to educate the public about geodesy, coastal mapping and other National Geodetic Survey (NGS) activities.</p>
<p>Justification: NGS must provide information about its products and services in order to meet its mission of providing access to the National Spatial Reference System. It is expensive for both end-users and NGS employees to travel to meetings and conferences, so the NGS public website geodesy.noaa.gov is often the most efficient way to distribute information. Additionally, video content (mp4 files) posted to the website has added value because the combination of text or images with narration can assist in explaining technical and complex material. However, the mp4 files posted to the website should be captioned or posted with a transcript in order to comply with Section 508 of the National Rehabilitation Act. <br />Section 508 states that, "When developing, procuring, maintaining, or using electronic and information technology, each Federal department or agency [...] shall ensure, unless an undue burden would be imposed on the department or agency, that the electronic and information technology allows, regardless of the type of medium of the technology, individuals with disabilities [...] to have access to and use of information and data that is comparable to the access of [those] who are not individuals with disabilities."<br />NGS has hosted numerous webinars and now manages a monthly Webinar Series. The current library of recorded webinars (each about 1 hour in length) needs to be captioned and posted online in conjunction with a transcript to ensure all users can benefit from these educational materials. To ensure the successful completion of this task, NGS requires the assistance of professionals to create captions based on existing mp4 files and provide:</p>
<p>&bull; Contractor will have access to the mp4 videos through an FTP site (NOS) that will be provided upon award.<br />&bull; The contractor will deliver a "perfected" caption file in the .SRT format. Perfected means:<br />o 99% accuracy of the words spoken by the moderator and speaker;<br />o 99% accuracy with respect to the timing of mp4 versus timestamping in the caption file;<br />o Text edited for grammar and spelling.<br />&bull; The .SRT file must include: <br />o A number showing the subtitle's order in the series, starting with 1.<br />o The time that the subtitle starts, followed by --&gt; and the time it ends.<br />o The subtitle text.<br />o A blank line to show where the next subtitle begins.<br />&bull; The contractor will provide a separate "perfected" transcript file, removing all numbers, timestamps and unnecessary spacing from the caption file. The transcript will be an editable text document.<br />&bull; NGS will provide the unedited mp4 file with the video and audio recording. NGS will also provide the accompanying slide decks (e.g. powerpoint slides) that were used in the webinar to assist with "perfecting" the content because a lot of the words are technical in nature.<br />&bull; Minimum of 600 minutes per week each QA/QC within a week of delivery.</p>
<p><br />IT Security Requirements<br />The Assessment and Authorization (A&amp;A) requirements of Clause 48 CFR 1352.239-72 do not apply, and a Security Accreditation Package is not required.<br />The contractor will not access, store, process or transmit any government privileged information. The contractor will not have access to any non-public government information, systems and/or networks.<br />1) The contractor must ensure all NOAA information and contractor solution resides within the United States.<br />2) All electronic provided information by the contractor must undergo malicious software scanning using a commercial anti-virus and anti-spyware software to ensure the information is free of known malicious software. The contractor must work with the COR prior to sending the information to establish a secure method for transfer (see NOS-ftp in previous section). <br />3) The contractor agrees, in the performance of this contract, to keep the information furnished by the Government and designated by the Contracting Officer or Contracting Officer's Technical Representative in the strictest confidence. The contractor also agree not to publish or otherwise divulge such information in whole or part, in any manner or form, nor to authorize or permit others to do so, taking such reasonable measures as are necessary to restrict access to such information while in the contractor's possession, to those employees needing such information to perform the work provided herein, i.e., on a "need to know" basis. The contractor agrees to immediately notify the Contracting Officer in writing in the event that the contractor determines or has reason to suspect a breach of this requirement. Upon request of the Contracting Officer, the contractor must securely remove all copies of the files developed for this acquisition.</p>

<p>NAM 1330-52.270-304, NOAA ACQUISITION AND GRANTS OFFICE OMBUDSMAN (OCT 2016)<br />a. The NOAA Acquisition and Grants Office (AGO) Ombudsman is available to organizations to promote responsible and meaningful exchanges of information. Generally, the purpose of these exchanges will be to:</p>
<p>1. Allow contractors to better prepare for and propose on business opportunities.</p>
<p>2. Advise as to technologies and solutions within the marketplace that the Government may not be aware of, or is not fully benefiting from.</p>
<p>3. Identify constraints in transparency and process.</p>
<p>b. The AGO Ombudsman will objectively, reasonably, and responsibly collaborate with parties and recommend fair, impartial, and constructive solutions to the matters presented to him/her. Further, the AGO Ombudsman will maintain the reasonable and responsible confidentiality of the source of a concern, when such a request has been formally made by an authorized officer of an organization seeking to do business with, or already doing business with NOAA.</p>
<p>c. Before consulting with the AGO Ombudsman, interested parties must first address their concerns, issues, disagreements, and/or recommendations with the respective contracting officer for resolution. However, direct access to the AGO Ombudsman may be sought when an interested party questions the objectivity or equity of a contracting officer's decision, or when there is a bona fide reason to believe that reasonable, responsible, and objective consideration will not be received from an assigned contracting officer.</p>
<p>d. There are several constraints to the scope of the AGO Ombudsman's authority, for instance:</p>
<p>1. Consulting with the AGO Ombudsman does not alter or postpone the timelines of any formal process (e.g., protests, claims, debriefings, employee employer actions, activities involving A76 competition performance decisions, judicial or congressional hearings, or proposal, amendment, modification or deliverable due dates, etc.).</p>
<p>2. The AGO Ombudsman cannot participate in the evaluation of proposals, source selection processes, or the adjudication of protests or formal contract disputes.</p>
<p>3. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to generate or alter laws, judicial decisions, rules, policies, or formal guidance.</p>
<p>4. The AGO Ombudsman is not authorized to develop or alter opportunity announcements, solicitations, contracts, or their terms or conditions.</p>
<p>5. The AGO Ombudsman cannot overrule the authorized decisions or determinations of the contracting officer.</p>
<p>6. The AGO Ombudsman has no authority to render a decision that binds AGO, NOAA, the Department of Commerce, or the U.S. Government.</p>
<p>7. The AGO Ombudsman is not NOAA's agent relative to the service of magistrate or judicial process and cannot be used to extend service of process to another party (whether federal, public, or a private entity).</p>

Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />3. (C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms.

UNIT PRICES (JUL 2016)

Contractor unit prices, when incorporated into a Government contract, may be releasable under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in the event NAVSUP FLCSD receives a FOIA request.

FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation: Evaluation - Commercial Items 

The Government intends to make a single award to the responsible Offeror whose offer is the most advantageous to the Government considering price and price related factors. The Government intends to award the contract to the eligible, lowest priced technically acceptable (LPTA), responsible offeror (see FAR 15.304).
 Award will be made upon price reasonableness determination, contractor determination of responsibility within the meaning of FAR Part 9, and acceptance to the provisions set forth herein. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 

Factor 1 Technical Approach:  

A.	Technicians performing the services shall be Eaton certified/authorized technicians.
 
Offeror shall provide written proof of Eaton certification/authorization with their proposals. 

If the contractor is proposing use of a subcontractor, this must be stated in the technical proposal along with the subcontractor point of contact information. 

B.	Offeror’s proposal shall demonstrate an approach that ensures the building critical power grid is not jeopardized during de-installation and installation of new capacitor assemblies.
Contractors shall clearly state in the proposal the procedures for replacement of oil filled capacitor from the front of the unit. Because of the room configuration, capacitor and fan is not accessible from the rear of the unit. Any offeror who proposes access from any other than the front of the unit will be determined to be technically unacceptable. The technical approach is not to be a restatement of the information contained in the PWS.  

Factor 2 Past Performance: 

Past performance has to be relevant which is considered work performed within the last 5 years. Any offeror who is determined unacceptable under Factor 1 will not be further considered for award. 

The Offeror shall list no more than ONE relevant contracts and/or subcontracts (not limited to Government contracts) within the last five years.
Relevancy shall be based on the ability to handle requirements of the same scope, magnitude and complexity to that which is detailed in the PWS. Include a discussion of how the references provided is relevant to the work being proposed. Max 2 pages per past performance reference.

Past Performance shall be evaluated based on the submission of past performance data supplied by the Offeror, the Government’s verification of that data (including information separately provided), and review of any other pertinent information. The government shall evaluate the Offeror’s past performance performed within the past 5 years which is similar in scope, magnitude, and complexity to that detailed in the Performance Work Statement.
Offerors who present “similar” contracts should provide a detailed explanation demonstrating the relevance of the contracts or efforts to the requirements of the solicitation.
Offerors may submit performance data regarding current contract performance as long as a minimum of one year of performance has been completed as of the closing date of this solicitation.

The offeror may also submit information regarding relevant contracts performed by any subcontractors and teaming partners who will perform under this contract. In such a case, the offeror must also clearly indicate the percentage of work that the subcontractor will perform under the contract and the work effort. Past performance will be evaluated as a teaming effort.

If the Offeror possesses no relevant past performance, it must affirmatively state this fact in the Past Performance Information Form. Each Offeror shall demonstrate relevant past performance or affirmatively state that it possesses no relevant past performance.
If the Offeror does neither of the foregoing, the proposal may not be eligible for award.

The contractor shall include the following information for each contract (or Task Order) submitted in this factor:

a)	Name of contracting activity;
b)	Contract number
c)	Contract type;
d)	The dollar amount of the contract (including options)
e)	Contract labor hours (including options)
f)	The actual dollar amount funded
g)	The actual labor hours (prime plus subcontractor) provided
h)	The dates of award and of completion or termination
i)	If terminated, the reason for termination (for Cause or Default or for Convenience of the Government)
j)	The name of the requiring agency
k)	The name, location, electronic mail address and phone number of the Contracting Officer, Administrative
l)	Contracting Officer, Contracting Officers Representative (COR) and Program Manager.
m)	Involvement as prime or subcontractor
n)	The purpose of the contract and brief description
o)	Information on problems encountered on each identified contract and the Offerors corrective action.

In addition, the Offeror shall identify any Government contract that has been terminated for Cause or Default within the past five years.
For each terminated contract, identify (i) the contract number, (ii) the requiring agency,
(iii) name and phone number of the contracting officer, and (iv) purpose of the contract. The Offeror shall describe the circumstances in the case of any cost overruns. The Offeror shall describe the circumstances in the case of any claims or requests for equitable adjustment and how they were resolved.

Factor 3 Price: Offeror shall provide a total price. 

Evaluation of quotes will be conducted on a lowest-priced, technically acceptable basis. All quotes will be evaluated first on Technical Capability. The quote will be evaluated for technical acceptability on an acceptable/unacceptable basis. A technically acceptable quote is one that demonstrates that the quoted product meets minimum requirements of Factors 1  and  2.
 

The Technical Capability Quotation shall consist of no more than 5 pages, excluding the title page, table of contents, and cross-reference index list.  Offerors are cautioned that no more than the first 5 pages of their Technical Capability Quotations will be evaluated.  If any offer is not in compliance with the page limitation on Technical Capability Quotations, the extra pages will be removed and not evaluated.  There shall be no price information included in the Technical sections of the quotation.  Award will be made on an all or none basis to the lowest priced technically acceptable vendor.

At the discretion of the Contracting Officer, the Government intends to evaluate proposals and award a contract without discussions with offerors.
Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.  However, the Contracting Officer reserves the right to conduct discussions if it is determined to be necessary before contract award.  Each initial offer should, therefore contain the Offerors best terms from both a price and technical standpoint.   

DELIVERY: The period of performance shall be date of award to 31 March 2019. 

PRICE. There is no page limit for price information. No price or pricing information shall appear in the Technical Capability quotations or Past Performance.  A Firm Fixed Price contract award will be made to offeror whose offer is determined to be the lowest priced technically acceptable offer.

This announcement will close at 9:00 am PST on 23 January 2019.

<DESC>The General Services Administration (GSA) Art in Architecture Program commissions American artists (citizens and Lawful Permanent Residents or Permanent Workers of the United States) to create publicly scaled and permanently installed artworks for Federal buildings nationwide.
<p>GSA announces an opportunity for a Federal art commission in conjunction with the construction of the new U.S. Land Port of Entry (LPOE) in Madawaska, Maine.</p>
<p>GSA will design and construct a new LPOE that meets the mission and operational requirements of the Federal inspection agencies.  The design and construction of the new LPOE will be in coordination with the Maine Department of Transportation (MaineDOT) and the New Brunswick (Canada) Department of Transportation and Infrastructure's (NBDTI).  MaineDOT and NBDTI are developing a new Madawaska (Maine) - Edmundston (Canada) International Bridge.</p>
<p>GSA allocates one-half of one percent of the estimated construction costs of new or modernized Federal facilities for art commissions.  The art budget for this project is estimated to be $257,688.  One or more artists will be awarded a fixed-price contract for a commission.</p>
<p>Artists who wish to be considered for this and all future GSA art commissions must submit application materials to GSA's National Artists Registry (Registry).  The Registry constitutes the qualified list of artists for this and all GSA commissions.  Instructions on how to join the Registry are available on the following Web site:</p>
<p>www.gsa.gov/artinarchitecture</p>
<p>All artists who wish to be considered as candidates for a commission at the new LPOE in Madawaska, Maine, must have their application materials submitted and received by GSA by 3:00 PM Eastern Time on Monday, February 18, 2019.  Artists' submissions received after the deadline will not be considered for this project, but will be eligible for consideration on future GSA commissions alongside the other artists on the Registry.  Artists already on the Registry need not resubmit, but may elect to update their information prior to the deadline.</p>
<p>GSA evaluates artists based on the following criteria: media, materials, content, style and scope of the artist's past work, and artist's past performance and experience with commissions or projects similar to the one described in this synopsis.  Short-listed artists will be contacted and asked to submit additional information including a statement that the artist can perform the work associated with the GSA commission within the identified budget.  GSA will count the combined weight of all the selection criteria as significantly more important than price.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the scope of services for this commission will require: collaboration with the lead designer selected for the LPOE project; development of preliminary and final concepts; fabrication of the artwork; participation in meetings and conservation reviews as necessary; and, the installation of the artwork at the project site.</p>

<p>The Government anticipates the issuance of a Firm Fixed Price (FFP) contract based on the best overall (i.e., best value) proposal that is determined to be the most beneficial to the Government in accordance with the procedures authorized in FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, and considering the following factors: (1) Technical; (2) Past Performance; (3) Price.</p>

<p>Proposal Content - Proposal must be responsive to and comply with the terms of the solicitation in order to be eligible to receive an award. The Government will reject the proposal if determined to be materially nonresponsive or that does not conform to the terms of the solicitation. To be eligible to receive an award, proposals submitted in response to this solicitation shall consist of the contents required in the sub-paragraphs described below:</p>
<p>a. Technical: The term "technical," as used herein, refers to the non-price elements listed below. Proposals will be rated as "Outstanding", "Acceptable" or "Unacceptable" in regards to ability to meet each element. Refer to Table 1 for a description of the ratings.

<p>b. Past Performance: The Government will evaluate offerors' likelihood of success in performing the solicitation's requirements as indicated by those offerors' record of past performance. Past performance ratings will be based on feedback provided by the points of contact from the technical experience projects, or data obtained from any other sources, such as the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS). Past performance of prime contractors whose firms are divided into severable segments (i.e. division, group, unit, etc.) will only be evaluated as it relates to those segments of the firm(s) that will actually perform the work. Contract references will be reviewed to determine the acceptability of the past performance information. The past performance must have occurred within three (3) years from the closing date of this solicitation and must have involved projects of similar size, scope, and complexity to the effort described in the PWS to be considered acceptable. The Government will assign a rating as indicated below.</p>

(See note below.)<br />Unacceptable Based on the offeror's performance record, the Government has no reasonable expectation that the offeror will be able to successfully perform the required effort.</p>
<p>NOTE: In the case of an offeror without a record of relevant past performance or for whom information on past performance is not available or so sparse that no meaningful past performance rating can be reasonably assigned, the offeror may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. Therefore, the offeror shall be determined to have unknown (or "neutral") past performance. In the context of acceptability/unacceptability, a neutral rating shall be considered "acceptable."</p>
<p>c. Price: A Firm Fixed Price (FFP) shall be submitted for this effort. The vendor will provide pricing for each SubCLIN with associated pricing that details Level of Effort (LOE). Each SubCLIN will be totaled, and the SubCLIN sub-totals will be included in the total proposal price. The Government will evaluate all aspects of the price proposal for reasonableness. Proposals found to be unreasonable may be rejected on that basis. The Government will only award the required contract if a fair and reasonable price can be obtained.</p>

<DESC><strong>*Amended 14 Jan 19 to correct typo in title.<br /><br />Sources Sought Synopsis ("SSS") (Not a notice of Solicitation)<br /></strong><br />The United States Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC), Air Force Life Cycle Management Center (AFLCMC), Wright Patterson Air Force Base (WPAFB), Ohio is seeking capability packages from potential sources, including Small Business (SB), 8(a), HUBZone, Women-Owned (WOSB), Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned (EDWOSB), Veteran-Owned (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned (SDVOSB) small businesses that are capable of supporting the Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) Program in connection with the <strong>Manufacture and Depot-Level Maintenance of a Combined Test Set ("CTS") Device</strong> as defined below.
<p><br />THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR AN INVITATION FOR BIDS. All interested firms shall submit a response demonstrating their capability to provide the requested items to the primary point of contact listed below. As stipulated in FAR 15.201, responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Any information submitted by respondents to this SSS is voluntary. This synopsis is not to be construed as a commitment by the United States Government (USG), nor will the USG reimburse any costs associated with the submission of information in response to this notice. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of any Government assessments.</p>
<p><strong>Requirement</strong>: The (USG) is seeking potential sources for the manufacture of CTS devices, including any ancillary and/or support items needed for operation, which may include, but is not limited to: batteries, straps, tripods, and carrying cases. The purpose of the CTS is to stimulate multi-sensor UV/IR aircraft survivability systems. Respondents must describe their ability to perform depot-level maintenance and/or establish an organic depot-level maintenance capability for the USG. Depot-level maintenance is defined as any action performed on material or software in the conduct of inspection, repair, overhaul, or the modification or rebuild of end-items, assemblies, subassemblies and parts (10 USC 2460). The organic depot shall be established at a location approved by AFMC. Once the capability is established, the USG will perform depot-level maintenance at the approved location.</p>
<p>Respondents must demonstrate they possess the expertise, capabilities, and experience in establishing an organic depot-level maintenance capability for the CTS. Additionally, the respondents to this inquiry must describe their ability and plan to access and convey to the Government the CTS depot-level source data required to establish an organic depot-level maintenance capability.</p>
<p><strong>Capability package</strong>: Interested parties shall submit a capabilities package, with a cover letter, that is brief and concise, yet clearly presents evidence that the interested party is fully capable of providing or can attain the stated requirements with sufficiently qualified personnel. Do not submit classified data. Please do not include company brochures or other marketing information. The government is specifically interested in the following information:</p>
<p>1. Describe your company's ability to manufacture and deliver CTS devices. If known, provide any documentation and/or declarations of commerciality of the CTS. The CTS shall be able to stimulate and read power output in a 10-250 foot region for UV and multi-color IR. <br /><br />2. Describe whether your company will require any portion of the work to manufacture and sustain the CTS to be subcontracted. Specify whom you anticipate contracting with and what percentage of the effort each subcontractor will perform. Specify the extent to which your firm believes small disadvantaged businesses, small businesses or other categories of businesses discussed in FAR Part 19 would be utilized in meeting the requirements specified herein. Teaming and/or subcontracting arrangements should be clearly delineated and previous experience in teaming should be provided.<br /><br />3. Describe your company's ability to manage the configuration of the CTS.<br /><br />4. Describe your company's ability to manage CTS Diminishing Manufacturing Sources and Material Shortages challenges throughout the system's life cycle.<br /><br />5. Describe your company's ability to establish an organic depot-level repair capability for the CTS. In addition, describe your company's ability to provide access to depot-level maintenance source data. Source Data must include, but is not limited to: Skilled personnel requirements, Training and Certifications, Engineering data and drawings, Technical manuals and documentation, Repair procedures, Test requirements, Special and common support/test equipment, Special and common tools, Provisioning data, Facility requirements, repair process flows, and verification of CTS and CTS maintenance procedures. The USG cannot provide certain types of data to support this effort; your company must be able to obtain this data.</p>
<p>6. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify existing and potential depot-level maintenance capabilities for the CTS, the CTS's components, and subcomponents.</p>
<p>7. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify specialized skill sets, conduct training to meet these skill sets, and enable the Government to obtain required certifications to perform depot-level repairs of the CTS.</p>
<p>8. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify, obtain, and provide special and common support/test equipment and tools to perform depot-level repairs of the CTS.</p>
<p>9. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify and provide provisioning data for the CTS depot-level maintenance. Provisioning is defined as the process of determining and acquiring the range and quantity of support items. This includes but is not limited to: spares, consumables, bulk materiel, tools, and test equipment necessary to operate and maintain a system.</p>
<p>10. Describe your company's experience and ability to identify and deliver technical manuals and other documentation necessary to operate and maintain organic depot-level maintenance operations for the CTS.</p>
<p>11. Describes your company's ability to stimulate the LAIRCM system's Hostile Fire Indication (HFI) functionality. If not, describe your company's ability to integrate HFI testing capability into the CTS to support potential future requirements.</p>
<p>12. Describe your company's ability to stimulate the LAIRCM system's laser warning.</p>
<p>13. Describe your company's ability to provide a prototype device to demonstrate its capability.</p>
<p>The capability package shall be limited to twenty (20) double-spaced, minimum ten (10) point font, single-sided pages.</p>
<p>Respondents who submit a capability package in response to this notice shall identify prior contracts (by contract number and issuing office) and commercial and Government points of contact (preferably the buyer or contracting officer) related to these efforts.</p>
<p>The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) Code to be used for this SSS is 336413 with a size standard of 1,250 employees. Firms responding should indicate their size in relation to this size standard, and also indicate socio-economic status (SB, 8(a), VOSB, SDVOSB, WOSB, EDWOSB, and/or HUBZone). Respondents are further requested to indicate their status as a Foreign-owned/foreign-controlled firm and any contemplated use of foreign national employees on this effort. Capability responses will be assessed and the data will be used to assist the Government in determining the acquisition strategy, including Small Business Set Aside (SBSA), sole source, or full and open, for any potential subsequent action. In accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 10.001, market research results will be used to determine whether FAR Part 19 criteria are met for a SBSA or further socio-economic set aside. Note that a key factor in determining an acquisition to be a SBSA is that small business prime contractors meet the requirements set forth in compliance with FAR 52.219-14, Limitation of Subcontract. Responses from small businesses, therefore, need to include rationale as to how compliance with FAR 52.219-14 will be achieved. Also, the rules governing affiliation and ostensible subcontracting apply when determining size, as does the non-manufacturer rule. All prospective contractors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database to be awarded a DoD contract.</p>
<p>If this effort is not a set-aside for small business, a small business utilization requirement will be considered. Request that large and small businesses provide a reasonable requirement for small business utilization as a percent of total contract value. Please provide supporting rationale for the recommended percentage.<br /><br />Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The USG appreciates that interested respondents may not be able to respond to this market research without disclosing information deemed "proprietary." Data submitted in response to this market research will be distributed and discussed within the Government. Respondents are responsible for clearly marking submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings. Analyses of responses may require disclosure of responses to Advisory and Assistance Services (A&amp;AS) support contractor personnel. All members of the Government/Contractor team will be reminded of their obligation to protect such information to the maximum extent permitted or required and other applicable statutes or regulations. In addition, USG members will be reminded of their obligations to afford protection under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C. 1905. All support contractor members are required to protect the information by the terms of their contracts.</p>
<p>Responses may be submitted electronically to the following email address: brett.everett@us.af.mil. All correspondence sent via email shall contain a subject line that reads "Sources Sought - LAIRCM CTS." If this subject line is not included, the email may not get through email filters at Wright-Patterson AFB. Filters are designed to delete emails without a subject or with a suspicious subject or attachments. Attachments with files ending in .zip or .exe are not allowable and will be deleted. Ensure only .pdf, .doc. or .xls documents are attached to your email; all other attachments may be deleted.</p>
<p>Responses may also be submitted via mail to: AFLCMC/WNYK, 2275 D Street, Bldg. 16, Room 0103, Wright Patterson AFB, OH 45433-7222, ATTN: Brett Everett.</p>
<p>Responses must be received no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the publication date of this announcement. If necessary, the Government may elect to contact interested parties for further clarifications or site visits.</p>

For the Government to identify and evaluate another system, perform the field testing of the equipment, produce the required SHIPALT records and drawings, produce all of the required support documentation, and schedule ships for equipment installation and other tasks is estimated at a cost of $125,000 in development and installation costs and would exceed two years. The development costs are derived from the development, prototyping, Engineering Development Models (EDMs), design of adjacent parts for fitting and operating the part, and testing - totaling 125,000. Most of these costs were borne by the development program in the 1980's. The two-year time estimate was derived from the amount of time which was required by Naval Coastal Systems Center to perform these identical tasks. Est. $56,000, FOB Origin.</p>

<DESC>This is an INDUSTRY DAY ANNOUNCEMENT by Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific (FRCWP) and NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) for Aviation Depot-Level Maintenance, Modification, Repair and Overhaul (MMRO) services in support of United States Marine Corps V-22 aircraft. This notice is issued solely for informational and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. The planned industry day will serve as a market research tool, both for informing industry of United States Government (USG) requirements for these services and for determining industrys interest, awareness and capabilities for providing those services. The industry day forum will allow for networking among interested service providers and lead to USG awareness of industrys capabilities for supporting this aircraft.
FRCWP will host the Industry Day at Naval Air Facility (NAF) Atsugi on 20 Feb 2019, beginning at 9:00 AM and ending at 4:00 PM ( Place: NAF Atsugi, Trilogy).

FRCWP uses contracts with MMRO service providers to support aircraft maintenance. In general, requirements will consist of Integrated Maintenance Plan (IMP) and In-Service Repair (ISR) Depot-Level support. FRCWP is particularly interested in identifying potential service providers for its upcoming V-22 IMP and ISR support requirement. Aviation MMRO service providers will have the opportunity to learn about FRCWPs mission, to meet with contracting personnel from Fleet Logistics Center Yokosuka (FLCY) and Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and to provide feedback to the Government to consider as we develop our requirements.
If questions arise during the industry day that cannot be answered in person, those answers will be published on FEDBIZOPPS after the event. There will be opportunities for Industry/Government one-on-one sessions for interested service providers. Depending on the number of companies attending, the one-on-one sessions are anticipated to be held in 60-minute intervals on the hour by appointment only.


Advance registration for this event is required. Parties interested in attending the industry day and the one-on-one sessions must submit the attached documents in your registration package via email to Mr. William Koeditz at William.Koeditz@fe.navy.mil and to Mr. Seiji Yoshino at seiji.yoshino.ja@fe.navy.mil.
Please also include the companys name, the names and titles of participating individuals, and contact information to include telephone numbers and email addresses in your registration package. Participating companies are further requested to provide CAGE and DUNS codes if available. No more than five participants per company may register. Additional instructions for accessing the industry day location will be provided at the time registration packages are received. All registrations must be received no later than 17:00 PM Tokyo time on 22 January 2019.


Registration submittals must include NAF Atusgi Base Access requests per the attached files. Participants wishing to attend the conference who do not possess the proper documents for access to NAF Atsugi must advise the USG during the reservation process.
If an attendee is other than a Japanese National or SOFA Sponsored, that individual must present a valid passport with current visa or alien registration card to the security personnel at the Main Gate in order to come aboard NAF Atsugi. All attendees not driving onto NAF Atsugi must be present at the NAF Atsugi Main (Front) Gate no later than 0800 (8:00 A.M.) on Feb 20th to be escorted aboard the installation.


Note: Per NAFATSUGIINST 5512.9F and USFJINST 31-204, Designated Third Country Nationals have additional registration requirements that must be completed before base access is approved. Attendees from such designated countries are advised to not make any travel arrangements/reservations before base access approval is confirmed.
FLCY/FRCWP will not process access requests for Government Officials from such designated countries. Third Countries include Malaysia and Singapore.

Vendors are responsible for securing their own lodging and food during this event. Industry participation is voluntary and the USG will not reimburse respondents or attendees for efforts expended as a result of this notice.

DESCRIPTION:  This is a Sources Sought-Pre-Solicitation Notice for the establishment of an Architect-Engineering (A-E) contract with services to be performed at the Albany VA Medical Center, 113 Holland Ave, Albany, NY 12208.  This requirement is 100% set-aside to Small Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms.   THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL; NO SOLICITATION PACKAGE WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL AFTER AN EVALUATION HAS BEEN MADE ON THE PROVIDED SF-330s. The SF-330 can be downloaded through the GSA Forms Library at: http://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/type/TOP, scroll down to locate and click on the SF-330 hyperlink entitled,  Architect-Engineer Qualifications.   

VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for complete design services (preliminary concepts and layouts, program development, investigative services, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services) for the Design   Replace Cooling Tower, Project# 528A8-19-807. 

The area of consideration is restricted to firms with offices and key personnel to be assigned to the design located within a 400-mile radius of the Albany VAMC site as indicated by a mapquest.com driving directions search from the prime designer s main or satellite office address to the project site.
.

Written questions pertaining to this requirement should be submitted no later than 4:00 PM. Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), February 4, 2019.  Interested firms should submit their current SF-330, Parts I and II, to Nicholas.Winne@va.gov.  The SF-330s are due no later than 4:00 PM, EDT, February 13, 2019.  

SCOPE OF WORK: 
The project includes design and construction period services for replacing Cooling Towers #1 and #2 on the roof of the chilled water plant (Bldg #54).  The existing cooling towers date to 1988 (estimated) and are developing leaks in the basin.  The structural steel supporting the cooling towers also needs to be replaced.  The existing towers are each rated for a nominal 700 ton capacity and serve chillers #1 and #2 respectively.  These cooling towers also serve a plate and frame heat exchanger which is used for a water side economizer system when outdoor air temperatures are suitable.

The A/E will develop the following add alternates in addition to replacing the cooling towers: 
 
Alternate #1 will provide piping and associated automatic valving and/or other controls to cross connect the cooling tower basins and cooling tower supply of Cooling Towers #1 & #2 with Cooling Tower #3 to provide improved redundancy and flexible plant operations.  Cooling Tower #3 is rated for a nominal 1000 tons capacity.  Under this alternate it is desired that any given cooling tower can serve any given chiller.  The existing condenser water pumps will remain in service.  

Alternate #2 will provide for a supplemental condenser water treatment such as UV lights to work in conjunction with traditional chemical treatment to reduce scaling and/or bacterial growth and aid in the prevention of legionella.

Alternate #3 will provide for installation of VFDs on condenser water pumps #15 and #16 serving Chiller #3

The AE shall conduct an engineering survey of the project to:
Evaluate the existing cooling tower dunnage and structural steel support.
Determine winter operation requirements for the water side economizer system.
Evaluate the existing electrical service, pipe sizes, pump capacity, and chiller flow requirements
Confirm existing condenser water piping configuration and size.  Provide analysis on the soundness of the existing condenser water piping for all three towers (including CT #3).  Recommend replacing piping if expected service life is less than the expected life of the towers.  
Develop  as-built  documentation of existing cooling towers as needed for design.  The VA has no information on the existing cooling tower installation or cad base sheets for the chiller plant.
Identify service space and rigging requirements.
Identify methods of protecting the roof while the work is progressing.
Identify any modifications needed to provide an automated condenser water circulation sequence to comply with health department guidelines with minimum energy usage
Survey and identify any required architectural or structural modifications.
Identify any dead legs that may be a deterrent to use of water circulation for bacterial control.  
A report on the engineering survey results shall be submitted for approval in advance of the 35% design submission
The A/E shall perform all work necessary to prepare the specifications, drawings, bidding documents, and provide construction period services for the subject project.  The design shall follow all VA/VHA Standards, VA Design Manuals, VHA Directives, Federal Energy Management Programs, as well as local, state, and federal codes. The A/E shall perform all work necessary to prepare the specifications, drawings, bidding documents, and provide construction period services for the subject project.

Throughout the design phase and construction phase, the A/E shall produce and maintain all meeting minutes. Meeting Minutes shall be submitted to the VA for concurrence within three (3) working days after a meeting. The A/E shall provide written response to design comments from the previous phases of design prior to submission of the succeeding phase submission within 7 working days of receipt of the Comments from the VA. Incomplete responses are grounds for rejection. Failure to incorporate all documented VA comments into succeeding phase submissions are grounds for rejection.  Invoices for work performed cannot be submitted until verification of design comments have been demonstrated to be incorporated into design documents and accepted by the COR.  
  
Prior to the submission of the un-reviewed final drawings and specifications, the A/E shall conduct a narrative walk-through with the COR for each of the trades included in the project to demonstrate that the work shown on the drawings can be physically constructed as depicted. The trades shall include, but not be limited to architectural, structural, plumbing, HVAC, fire protection and electrical. The designer for each trade shall be present at the walk-through which will encompass all of the physical areas affected by the project. Individual walk-through may be conducted for specific trades. Upon completion of the walk-through, the VA will give direction to the A/E whether the design may proceed to completion as shown or whether some redesign is necessary. The walk-through shall be scheduled by the A/E in a manner that will allow corrections before the un-reviewed final submission due date. Required corrections will not excuse the A/E from submitting the un-reviewed final drawings and specifications on time.

All designs will follow, but not be limited to, the VA HVAC Design Manual, Steam & Heating Hot Water Design Manual and Sustainable Design Manuals in conjunction with the VA Master specifications. The design will be completed in a manner such that the estimated construction cost is within the VA budget.
