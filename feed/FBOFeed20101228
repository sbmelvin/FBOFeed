Please note: The bid documents will be in the Norwegian language.

NDEA is serving as the NATO procurement agency for this project, which is being funded within the framework of the Infrastructure Committee. NDEA has been authorized to use the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedure. It is the intention to let the contract to one contractor only on a turnkey basis.

The estimated value of this project is Euro 820,000. The project will be identified as the following: Oerland 5AF11134 Restore AWACS Platform.  

The Invitation for Bid (IFB) will be an unclassified document.  Please note, however, that all personnel involved in site visits, installation, etc. are required to have a NATO RESTRICTED clearance. The contractor is responsible for ensuring that the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) forwards to the NATO contracting agency the NATO clearance certifications needed for performance of the contract.

SCOPE OF WORK

-	Replace existing concrete pavement with concrete bricks: 12500 m2
-	Replace concrete foundation for hangar gate: 330 m2

BIDDING PROCEDURE 

Before a firm can be nominated to the bidders list for this ICB procurement, it must be approved for participation in NATO ICB. Firms are approved for NATO ICB on a facility-by-facility basis. Only facilities located in NATO member nations may participate in NATO ICB. The U.S. Department of Commerce approves facilities that are located within the United States. 

U.S. firms will find a copy of the U.S. NATO ICB application at the following website: 

http://www.bis.doc.gov/defenseindustrialbaseprograms/OSIES/NATOprograms/index.htm

The NATO ICB application is a one-time application. The application requires supporting documentation in the form of 1) a company resume and 2) an annual report or set of financial documents indicating compilation, review, or audit by an independent CPA.  The application and supporting documentation may be submitted as e-mail attachments. If, when submitting the application, your firm is interested in a specific NATO ICB project, please include the following in the text of your email:

- the title and/or solicitation number of the project
- the name/phone/FAX/email of the point of contact for the bid documents

Upon approval of your one-time NATO ICB application, the Department of Commerce will then know to follow up by issuing a Declaration of Eligibility (DOE) for that project.  A DOE is used to nominate an approved firm to the bidders list for a particular NATO ICB project.

Using the contact information indicated on the DOE, the NATO contracting agency will contact the firm directly when the IFB has been issued.

IMPORTANT DEADLINES

1. Final date to request a DOE (and, for U.S. facilities not yet approved for NATO ICB, to submit a completed NATO ICB application): 10 January 2011

2. Anticipated IFB release date: first week of February 2011

3. Bid closing date: 42 days from the date of distributing the bid documents.  

4. The bids shall have a validity of 6 months.

<CONTACT>Samantha Fuchs

<a href="mailto:Fuchs.Samantha@epamail.epa.gov">Fuchs.Samantha@epa.gov</a>
<DESC>Synopsis:The Economic and Environmental Impacts from Increased use of Renewable Fuels in the US Transportation Sector
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Office of Transportation and Air Quality (OTAQ), Office Acquisition Management (OAM) Cincinnati Procurement Operations Division (CPOD), intends to negotiate, on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1, The Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) at Iowa State University, Ames, IA.  The applicable NAICS code is 541614.
The Transportation and Climate Division (TCD) of the U.S. EPA is responsible for understanding and analyzing the economic and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) impacts of renewable fuel policies affecting the U.S. transportation sector.  Economic models are necessary to develop this analysis for various renewable fuel pathways, as well as for providing estimates of the impacts of waiving provisions of the Renewable Fuel Standard.The nature of the acquisition requires a contractor that possesses the unique capability/capabilities of understanding how changes in U.S. renewable fuel demand in the transportation sector impacts the domestic and international agriculture sector in terms of economic and environmental effects.  Many of the policies TCD needs to analyze have not been well studied in the past, and may therefore require conducting new analysis, or modifying underlying assumptions or updating current analysis with more recent information.  EPA has conducted market research to determine those firms that could conduct these types of analyses, and the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development (CARD) at Iowa State University was identified as the only firm that has the capability to analyze the domestic and international impacts of the increased use of renewable fuels in the U.S. transportation sector using highly detailed, partial-equilibrium economic models that provide the necessary information sufficient for the needs of EPA?s analysis.  This capability includes detailed analyses of the domestic and international agriculture commodity sectors, comprising impacts on commodity prices, trade, and production on a country-by-country basis on a commodity-by-commodity basis.  In some cases, namely the U.S. and Brazil, a more detailed regional analysis can be provided for more accurate accounting of impacts on crop and livestock production area, which ultimately provides EPA the ability to conduct more accurate greenhouse gas emission impacts.  The domestic and international commodity models that CARD maintains as part of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute are updated on an annual basis and presented to Congress.  These models are specifically designed to make future projections for commodity production, prices, and trade in the domestic and international agriculture sector, including biofuels.  In addition, CARD maintains and operates a detailed stochastic model that can analyze the causal relationships between the domestic agriculture and energy markets.  The combined capability of these tools results in a unique and comprehensive approach to analyze the economic and environmental impacts of the production and use of renewable fuel in the U.S. transportation sector.  In addition with their long-time expertise in producing projections for the global agriculture sector, and their capability to analyze various policy scenarios regarding the use of renewable fuel, CARD is uniquely qualified to provide the analysis that is needed by EPA.CARD is the only known source able to satisfy the Government?s requirement(s) because as the owner and operator of a unique set of partial-equilibrium international commodity models that can analyze U.S. production and consumption of renewable fuel in the transportation sector, as well as stochastic models analyzing the U.S. agriculture and energy sectors, the contractor will be able to prepare analysis with a level of detail in an expedited manner necessary to support TCD?s high priority, mission critical, regulatory and legislative analysis activities.Work is to consist of the following:Task One: Modeling Alternative Scenarios of Renewable Transportation Fuels from the Agriculture Sector using the FAPRI models.Alternative scenarios will be analyzed to provide estimates of the impacts of different renewable fuels volumes on the agricultural sector, domestically as well as globally.  Examples of the variables of interest to be analyzed include commodity prices, commodity usage patterns, food prices, changes in agricultural commodity imports and exports, and land usage pattern changes.For each scenario, the changes in crops and livestock production in the U.S., Brazil (for example), and other major producing countries will be estimated relative to baseline levels using CARD?s domestic and international agricultural sector models.  Deliverables:  The Contractor will conduct analyses of the U.S. and global agriculture sector tailored specifically to EPA?s questions/scenarios.  Technical directives will be given to the Contractor specifying the types of analyses and scenarios the Contractor shall undertake.  Modeling results will be provided in the form of spreadsheets, briefing packages and short Memorandum.Task Two: Maintain and Enhance Models of the U.S. Agricultural and Energy Sectors to Enable Analysis of Biofuel Markets and Impact of MandatesThe analysis of the current and expected future impact of mandated biofuels volumes requires maintenance of stochastic models that can account for volatility in agricultural prices and production and volatility in energy prices.  Existing models in FAPRI of the corn, soybean, ethanol, biodiesel, gasoline, diesel, and other commodity markets will be maintained and enhanced as needed to provide analytical capability that EPA can use to better understand the impacts of RFS mandates.  Possible uses of this analysis could include evaluating RFS waiver requests.  The models will be used to estimate the distribution of changes in crop prices, fuel prices, and the impacts of the RFS on consumers, biofuels producers, taxpayers, and livestock feeders.Deliverables:  The Contractor will provide documentation listing and briefly describing the assumptions and impacts of the models employed.  Upon request from EPA, the models will be used to estimate the impacts of RFS mandates.  The impacts will be reported in the in the form of spreadsheets, briefing packages and short Memorandum.
This is not a request for proposal. However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting EPA's requirement may submit technical documentation to establish the potential of complying with the specifications. Such documentation must be submitted to the point of contact within 15 days of the posting of this notice. 
A determination not to compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered only for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis. The applicable NAICS code is 541614. Please submit your request in writing to: US EPA, Samantha Fuchs at 26 W. Martin Luther King Dr, Cincinnati, OH, 45268 or fax your request to (513) 487-2107, or email fuchs.samantha@epa.gov. No telephone request will be honored.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

Place of Contract Performance: Washington, DC

Set-Aside Status: Total Set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)

Description

The mission of VBA, in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), is to provide benefits and services to Veterans and their families in a responsive, timely, and compassionate manner in recognition of their service to the Nation.

VBA has six lines of business, which deliver services and benefits to Veterans. These are:
o Benefits Assistance Service (BAS)
o Compensation and Pension (C&P)
o Education
o Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)
o Insurance
o Loan Guaranty

For more information regarding these lines of business and the various benefits and services they provide, please visit http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/index.asp.

Each line of business has several unique software applications and systems enabling the establishment, development, and payment of over $47 billion annually  in benefits claims. VBA, in conjunction with VA's Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), is in the process of modifying, upgrading, and replacing a number of these applications and systems, and will likely devote significant effort to such activities throughout the period of performance of this contract. While OI&T is responsible for their development, deployment, and maintenance of applications and systems, VBA is responsible for all business requirements gathering, user testing, training, and organizational change management required to implement new software and hardware, as well as any non-IT support services (e.g., business support services) that provide inputs to system implementation efforts. VBA does not develop any applications or systems internally. Any information technology assets or services associated with these VBA projects will be procured by OI&T using separate contract vehicles.

VBA requires on-site project management support and business analysis services for its staff offices, business lines and affiliate VA organizations.

VBA staff offices, business lines and affiliates (hereafter VBA organizations) require these services to support the business activities  surrounding their management of business initiatives and the design, development, implementation, modification, sustainment and portfolio management of their software applications and systems. Multiple VBA organizations have projects and programs  that currently require such services and as these projects and programs are completed, or as new priorities arise, some VBA organizations may require less support while others may require additional support or support for the first time.

Project management support and business analysis services shall be performed on a firm fixed price and/or labor hour basis. To compensate for the fluid nature of this requirement, this contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. VBA organizations will independently procure services via task orders (TOs) against this IDIQ contract. Services will be performed by contractors in labor categories defined in Section 4 of this PWS. TOs will specify the number of contractors in each labor category (and therefore the services) needed by the requiring VBA organization, whether the services shall be performed on a firm fixed price or labor hour basis, any required deliverables and any special conditions associated with performance.

TOs will be aligned with individual VBA organizations and each TO will be managed by a Government Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) who has direct experience in the business requirement on which the TO is focused.

The Contractor shall perform the work in accordance with this RFQ, the resultant contract, and the detailed individual TOs.

The Government intends to make multiple awards as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contracts (ID/IQ) will have one 12-month base period with four 12-month options. The solicitation will be issued on or about November 30, 2010 with an anticipated close date of on or about May 20, 2010.

<DESC>REPLACE 5TH FLOOR AHU AND ASSCOCIATED DUCTS
               PROJECT NUMBER 575-11-105


   This project is a design build construction contract.  The contract will require a professional service to survey the occupancy of the 5th floor, Building 1 and design a variable air volume system with electronic controls. Design is expected to meet energy efficiency standards as set by trade authorities and the Federal Government.  The air handler unit will utilize the existing connections for steam and chilled water.    Construction will remove the existing system and install the new system. Construction will also require the removal of asbestos board surrounding the interior surfaces of the radiator wells throughout the 5th floor along with removal of the perimeter steam heating radiators.  Infection control procedures will be an integral part of the design.  Coordination with all on-site VA constructions projects are expected by this contract.
 

Constructed in 1980, the existing system is dual duct, high velocity, and constant volume system.  The AHU and ductwork serves approximately 15000 square feet of patient care area. The existing air handling unit is located on the roof structure of the 6th floor with supply and return air duct work penetrating the interstitial space between the 6th and 7th (penthouse) floors.  The area is currently occupied by Intensive Care, Mental Hygiene and Post Anesthetic Care Unit.  Because of this occupancy, the design/build contractor will be required to provide a work schedule that will minimize impact on those services.  
  
The design and construction of this project is anticipated to involve 270 days.  During the construction period, the contractor is expected to provide safety barriers and other means to ensure the safety of patients, visitors and staff.


The C & A requirements do NOT apply to this project.
									
The design and build shall utilize the VA Master Specifications and Design Manuals/Guides as found at www.cfm.va.gov/til/spec.asp.  Other codes and standards are current editions of ASHRAE, NEC, ANSI, NFPA, OSHA and IBC.

<DESC>*** BACKGROUND ***
<p>The Defense Logistics Agency - Troop Support supplies the military Services with nerve agent antidotes during peacetime and wartime. This is a Request for Information (RFI) on current manufacturing capabilities and new technology development for nerve agent antidotes in auto-injectors that might be used in wartime in response to chemical attacks. They could also be used in peacetime.</p>
<p>This is not a request for proposals and does not commit the U.S. Government to issue a solicitation, make an award, or pay any costs associated with responding to this announcement. All submitted information shall remain with the U.S. Government and will not be returned.</p>
<p>*** OBJECTIVE ***</p>
<p>The nerve agent antidote auto-injectors, hereinafter referred to as auto-injectors, are pressure activated devices suitable for intramuscular administration. The unit will contain active drug ingredients (e.g. atropine, pralidoxime, diazepam, etc.) for the purpose of countering the effects of nerve agent poisoning.</p>
<p>In wartime, the need for auto-injectors may increase significantly. To meet an increased demand, the existing supply and baseline production capacity of auto-injector devices in the U.S. may need to expand. DLA Troop Support is requesting information on existing and planned manufacturing capabilities for auto-injectors.</p>
<p>***CURRENTLY MARKETED DEVICES***</p>
<p>If your firm currently markets an auto-injector device, please provide information with respect to the following:</p>
<p>a) Place of manufacture<br />b) Estimated annual capacity<br />c) FDA registration (if applicable)<br />d) Product name and description including description of any special features<br />e) Current unit sale price<br />f) Estimated inventory level and storage requirements</p>
<p><br />*** NEW TECHNOLOGY/DEVICES UNDER DEVELOPMENT***</p>
<p>For products under development, describe the current stage of development and whether the product has undergone independent laboratory testing or FDA testing/trials etc.</p>
<p>Firms and organizations that currently develop or manufacture auto-injectors described in this RFI or that have technologies, devices or manufacturing capabilities under development are invited to submit information to DLA Troop Support. Data obtained from this RFI will be used by DLA Troop Support in making recommendations and decisions on the development of an appropriate planning and procurement strategy for auto-injectors. All information submitted will be kept confidential as allowed by relevant Federal law and will be eligible for additional special protections under the conditions of the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program outlined in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002.</p>
<p>Your response to this RFI may be submitted electronically in pdf format and emailed to neil.mcavinue@dla.mil</p>

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This Announcement constitutes a Sources Sought Synopsis. This is not a Request for Proposal and will be used to identify SBA Certified 8(a), HubZone and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) firms for the purpose of determining how the solicitation will be advertised. We are seeking SBA Certified 8(a) Firms, HubZone, and Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Firms. This sources sought announcement is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government, implied or otherwise, to issue a solicitation or award a contract. NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO SUBMIT A BID ON THIS PROJECT WHEN IT IS FORMALLY ADVERTISED, PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT SYNOPSIS. If we do not receive an adequate number of qualified respondents (i.e. two or more responsible firms), the solicitation shall be issued on an unrestricted basis and all firms regardless of size shall be eligible and encouraged to compete for this project.<BR><BR>The Project Description for the Kissimmee River Restoration Project S-69 Weir includes the following:  design and construction of a steel sheet pile U-shaped Weir, earthen tie-back levees, concrete apron /access road, levee erosion armoring, channel backfill, site grading and incidental related work that will be depicted on preliminary drawings.  The S-69 U-Shaped Weir Project will backfill the C-38 canal just above the CSX Railroad Bridge in order to redirect flow into the historic Kissimmee River channel and rehydrate the upstream floodplain. Because the historic river channel has a much lower flow capacity than the C-38 canal, a passive water control structure will be needed in order to alleviate flooding onto lands outside the Kissimmee River boundaries that are not owned by the South Florida Water Management District. This control structure will be constructed at the downstream terminus of the C-38 backfill and will be a steel sheet pile weir which will be roughly 3'-0" above the existing local grade elevation. During storm events, the weir will spill floodwater into the remaining portion of the C-38 canal downstream of the weir.   The weir has been located at a safe distance upstream of the existing CSX Railroad Bridge in order to avoid potential scour of its bridge piers. In order to close the system and create the flood plain, earth tie-back levees will be provided between the downstream ends of the weir and the railroad embankment. A 14' wide unpaved road will be constructed along the crest of the levees on both banks of the river for maintenance egress. The access roads above the levees will be connected by a 16' wide concrete apron on the downstream side of the weir that will serve as both a roadway and erosion control.<BR><BR>Design Requirements:  The US Army Corps of Engineers has performed preliminary design of the weir in order to locate the structures and permit the project. The Contractor will need to complete the design of the weir and construct the project based on this design. The remaining design work includes, generating civil plans of the levees and earthwork, performing stability, seepage, and soil bearing analysis of the levees, design of erosion armoring, design of the steel sheet pile weir, design of the maintenance roadway, and mitigating settlement for the portion of the weir crossing the backfilled canal. All construction documents shall be signed sealed by professional engineers registered in the State of Florida.  The contractors engineers will need to participate in the intermediate and final reviews and address all comments prior to the contractor receiving notice to proceed with construction.  <BR><BR>Construction Requirements:  The scope of work includes backfilling the C-38 canal by degrading spoil mounds remaining from the canal excavation. These mounds are located on the west bank of the C-38 canal. The weir will be approximately 1900 linear feet of cantilevered steel sheet pile retaining wall with a 16 foot wide concrete apron/maintenance road on its downstream face. In order to provide uniform circulation and flow of water over the weir, shallow equalization channels will be excavated immediately upstream of the east and west legs of the weir. Roughly 1000 linear feet of earthen levees will be provided between the ends of the weir and the CSX railroad embankment on each bank in order to close the system and create the flood plain. The transition between the weir and levees will require armoring in order to prevent local erosion. Access roads will be constructed above the levees with ramps transitioning to adjacent grade. Upstream and downstream safety barriers will also be in the scope of work.  <BR><BR>The Magnitude of Construction is between $5,000,000.00 and $10,000,000.00. <BR><BR>Please provide a Statement of Capability (SOC) stating your skills, experience, and knowledge required to perform the specified type of work. This SOC should be a brief description of your company's capabilities. The potential bidders should provide brief references of relevant work they have performed and the magnitude of construction. Also, interested contractors must include bonding information (on the bonding company letterhead) accompanied by a valid power of attorney that the company has the capability to provide bonding up to $10 million. <BR><BR>Receipt of potential offerors SOC shall be no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the date of this notice by 4:00 pm. Responses to this sources sought may be faxed, to the attention of Pamela Shirley at (904) 232-2748, mailed to U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Contracting Division, 701 San Marco Blvd., Jacksonville, Florida 32202; or sent via email to Pamela.j.shirley@usace.army.mil.

<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services. It concerns an action which may affect the current procurement of the products listed in this Notice by the Federal Government. <br /><br />The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government. The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals. Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (PL). You can view the PL on our website at www.abilityone.gov. Once a product is added to the PL to be provided by a nonprofit agency, no other product determined to be essentially the same can be sold to the Federal government.

<p>In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:</p>
<p>1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period. When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations. If your company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporation to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporation's total revenue data.</p>
<p>2) Revenues accrued by providing the products listed in this Notice to the federal government for the same most recent 12-month period</p>
<p>3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to the federal government.</p>
<p>The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than January 12, 2011 and can be submitted in letter format. If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed products be added to the PL.</p>
<p>It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis. Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to (703) 603-0655. You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate. If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.</p>

Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.abilityone.gov.

A Request for Proposals was issued to three (3) vendors, quotes were received from two (2), and Verizon was awarded the subcontract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The initial start date of the Verizon subcontract was October 15, 2008 and it will end on May 6, 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government intends to award a follow-on contract to Verizon, or one of its subsidiary companies, on a non-competitive basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><br />Under 41 U.S.C. &sect;253(c), an executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures if the services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This exception applies in the case of a follow-on requirement for the continued production of a major system when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition, or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the executive agency's needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under such circumstances, the services may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures. <br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><br />A draft version of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), substantially the same as will be included in the intended Verizon follow-on contract, is attached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any acronyms that follow are defined in the PWS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Awarding a contract to a company other than Verizon to provide the required services as detailed in the PWS will duplicate the cost of migrating the CSF and DRF - a cost the government incurred in late 2008 and early 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The government would also incur the cost of continuing the Verizon services while the new service provider moves and replaces the nationwide circuits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A new service provider would need to install approximately fifty (50) circuits and circuit installation requires approximately forty-five (45) days to complete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The larger and more complex DS3 circuits take much longer than forty-five (45) days to install.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the router at each of the approximately forty-seven (47) HUD OIG site is specialized equipment owned and managed by Verizon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The routers, along with the circuits, require replacement if a new service provider is selected.

This software has 1-Dimensional and 2-Dimensional simulation capabilities for use in modeling complex river systems.
<p>Market research was conducted on December 7, 2010. Deltares USA is the only known vendor for Sobek software.</p>
<p>A sources sought notice was posted to FedBizOpps on December 10, 2010 and closed on December 20, 2010. No responses were received.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service National Operational Hydrologic Remote Sensing Center (NOHRSC) has been tasked with prototyping new tools for use in the visualization of flood impacts through flood mapping. This includes mapping flood impacts in the typical river floodplains, but also in coastal zones and estuaries where the oceans have an influence. To meet the objectives, the NOHRSC requires hydrologic 1-Dimensional/2-Dimensional modeling software capable of simulating the complex river systems. Over recent years, the National Weather Service conducted several studies to evaluate the available capabilities of both open-source and commercial hydrologic models and now need to further explore the capabilities of these models. The National Weather Service previously purchased one license of Sobek Flow 1-Dimensional Open Water and 2-Dimensional Overland hydrologic modeling software and requires a second license for further research.</p>
<p>The 1-Dimensional and 2-Dimensional hydrologic modeling software specifications requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>1. 1-Dimensional River (Open Water) flow with unlimited computational nodes<br />2. 2-Dimensional Overland flow with unlimited flexible mesh<br />3. Support for levees, dams, weirs and other typical river structures<br />4. Support for flood mapping<br />5. Capability to interface with 3-Dimensional models, i.e., costal and estuary models<br />6. Model adapter for the Deltares Flood Early Warning System (FEWS)<br />7. Support and updates for one year from date of purchase</p>

For this purpose, OP will require the contractor to scan and catalogue the report holdings for two individuals as a pilot project for the creation of this digital archive/ library.  This additional work is integrally related to work under this purchase order and cannot be separated from ongoing work.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 541611.  No solicitation or request for quote (RFQ) is available.

Justification and Approval

For

Other Than Full and Open Competition


1.	Contracting Organization:  Department of Veterans Affairs, VISN 8,  West Palm Beach VA Medical Center (VAMC)

2.	Description of Action:  This is a request for other than full and open competition for an out of scope modification to GSA delivery order 548-C10072 (V797P-7105A), which provides reference laboratory services from Quest Diagnostics.  This modification will add three additional months to the current period of performance.  This order was established with a period of performance from October 1 - December 31, 2010 as a bridge contract in anticipation of award of a VISN-wide BPA by December 2010.  The award of the VISN-wide BPA is still pending legal review as of December 22, 2010 thus necessitating continuation of the services provided under the current order through March 31, 2011.

3.	Description of Supplies or Services:  The services provided by Quest through this delivery order are for the testing of patient laboratory specimens collected at the West Palm Beach VAMC that cannot be tested on-site.  The scope of work includes approximately 200 different types of tests of varying volumes totaling approximately 20,000 individual tests per year.

4.	Statutory Authority:  
	(x)  (1) Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy 
		      Agency Requirements per FAR 6.302-1;
	(  )  (2) Unusual and Compelling Urgency per FAR 6.302-2;
	(  )  (3) Industrial Mobilization, Engineering, Developmental or Research Capability
		       or Expert Services per FAR 6.302-3;
	(  )  (4) International Agreement per FAR 6.302-4
	(  )  (5) Authorized or Required by Statute FAR 6.302-5;
	(  )  (6) National Security per FAR 6.302-6;
	(  )  (7) Public Interest per FAR 6.302-7;

5.	Validity of Use of Statutory Authority: The exact collection specimen, instructions, reference range, and interpretive remarks for each test are unique to the contractor providing these services and must be manually inputted into a VA database as was done prior to the commencement of work currently being performed by Quest.  Inputting this information requires a 30 day transition lead time since laboratory staff must allocate time away from patient care-related duties in order to do so.  The unexpected unavailability of the VISN-wide BPA has left insufficient time (less than 5 business days) to conduct a new procurement, let alone potentially transition to a new contractor.  For these reasons, Quest Diagnostics is the only source that can continue providing these services as of January 1, 2011.  

6.	Actions to Promote Competition:  Competition has been undertaken through the solicitation for the VISN-wide BPA which will provide these services once the BPA is awarded.  It is still in legal review as of December 22, 2010 and has been in legal review for approximately 6 months due to a protest according to the CO.  If this review is not completed by January 31, 2011, steps will be taken to undertake a new long term procurement for the West Palm Beach VAMC's testing services separate from the BPA.

7.	Determination of Fair and Reasonable Price:  The costs of each test will be based on Quest Diagnostics' Federal Schedule pricing (or better) which has already been determined as fair and reasonable.

8.	Market Survey (FAR 10):  Market research identified two other Federal Schedule holders which could provide all or some of these tests.  This information will be applied to a new long term procurement if needed.  

9.	Other Considerations:  None

10.	Listing of Sources that expressed, in writing, an interest in the acquisition: Quest Diagnostics

11.	Statement of Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition: If the VISN-wide BPA is not available to place orders by January 31, 2011, new acquisition planning will begin for a competitive solicitation for the West Palm Beach VAMC's requirements.

12.	Requirements Certification:  I certify that the requirement outlined in this justification is a bonafide need of the Department of Veterans Affairs and that the supporting data under my cognizance, which are included in the justification, are accurate and complete to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Successful bidder will be notified by either mail or telephone.

If, after the award, the Purchaser breaches the contract by failure to make payment within the time allowed by the contract or by failure to remove the property within the time  allowed by the contract, then the Government may send the Purchaser a 7-day written notice of default (calculated from date of notification), and upon Purchaser's failure to cure such default within that period (or such further period as the Contracting Officer may allow) the Purchaser shall lose all right, title, and interest which he/she might otherwise have acquired in and to such property as to which a default has occurred. The Purchaser agrees that in the event he/she fails to pay for the property or remove the same within the prescribed period(s) of time, the Government shall be entitled to retain (or collect) as liquidated damages a sum equal to the greater of (a) 20 percent of the purchase price of the item(s) as to which the default has occurred, or (b) $25, whichever is greater:
                  Practices that eliminate competition, such as collusive bidding, may warrant criminal, civil, or
                    administrative action against the participant(s) and may be referred to the Department of Justice 
                    in accordance with 41 CFR 101-45.317.1.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program<br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).<br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:<br />Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904<br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p><br />** UNIFORM ALLOWANCE **</p>
<p>If employees are required to wear uniforms in the performance of this contract<br />(either by the terms of the Government contract, by the employer, by the state<br />or local law, etc.), the cost of furnishing such uniforms and maintaining (by<br />laundering or dry cleaning) such uniforms is an expense that may not be borne by<br />an employee where such cost reduces the hourly rate below that required by the<br />wage determination. The Department of Labor will accept payment in accordance<br />with the following standards as compliance:</p>
<p>The contractor or subcontractor is required to furnish all employees with an<br />adequate number of uniforms without cost or to reimburse employees for the<br />actual cost of the uniforms. In addition, where uniform cleaning and maintenance<br />is made the responsibility of the employee, all contractors and subcontractors<br />subject to this wage determination shall (in the absence of a bona fide<br />collective bargaining agreement providing for a different amount, or the<br />furnishing of contrary affirmative proof as to the actual cost), reimburse all<br />employees for such cleaning and maintenance at a rate of $3.35 per week (or $.67<br />cents per day).

<p><strong>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS</strong> - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: Department of Homeland Security, United States Coast Guard (CG-9131), Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests, 1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602, Washington, D. C. 20593-0001, FAX: 202.475.3904. The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS - United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal forum with the Ombudsman: Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman: Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). <br />Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to: <br />Department of Homeland Security <br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests <br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602 <br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001 <br />FAX: 202.475.3904 <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695</p>

Therefore, offeror's initial offer should contain its best terms. The Government will award a contract resulting from this synopsis/solicitation to the responsible offeror whose offer conforming to the solicitation will be more advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered. For the purpose of this solicitation past performance is approximately equal to price.<br />The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: Past Performance and Price.<br />1) Past Performance: In accordance with FAR 52.212-1(b)(10) and the following, the offeror is required to identify past or current contracts for efforts similar to this requirement. Offerors shall provide the information shown below for at least three (3) and no more than five (5) contracts for the same or similar items, either currently being performed or completed within three years prior to the date of this synopsis/solicitation. Provide as a minimum the following applicable information for each contract:<br />(a) Contract number, Names of contracting parties or agency, point of contact, specifically the Contracting Officer and the Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR), including email address and telephone number of these identified individuals.<br />(b) Ship name, hull type, length, and displacement.<br />(c) Type of availability (dry dock, dockside, etc.) and where performed;<br />(d) Original contract commencement and completion dates, actual commencement and completion dates, and explanation of (i.e. reasons for) schedule slippage/extensions, if any;<br />(e) Award price and final contract price (award plus growth), including the total number of growth work changes and scope of these changes. <br />Past Performance will look at relevant experience, responsiveness, resources, quality and consistency of services, customer satisfaction, and management.<br />2) Price: The aggregate price determined by totaling the offer price for the definite items, plus the composite labor hour extended total.<br />Past performance is approximately equal to cost or price. <br />A written notice of award or acceptance of an offer, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful offeror within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>INSPECTION OF CUTTER PRIOR TO SUBMISSION OF OFFERS<br />(a) All prospective offerors are urged to visit the cutter and visually inspect each item of<br />Work and to become acquainted with local conditions, locations of items and fixtures,<br />removals, replacements, interference and the nature of work. CGC ALEX HALEY will<br />be available for ship check during the solicitation process. Please call LT Toby Kilborn, Project Manager of CGC ALEX HALEY, at (907) 487-5616 to arrange a ship check.<br />(b) Failure to inspect the cutter will not relieve the offeror from responsibility for properly estimating the difficulty or cost of successfully performing the work.<br />(c) The Government assumes no responsibility for any representations concerning conditions made by any of its officers, agents, or employees before execution of the contract unless included in the solicitation, documents incorporated therein or amendments thereto.</p>
<p>EVALUATION APPROACH<br />(a) An evaluation plan has been established to evaluate the factors set forth below and all proposals shall be subject to evaluation by a team of Government personnel in accordance with the plan.<br />(b) The Government will evaluate each proposal strictly in accordance with its content and will not assume that performance will include areas not specified in the offeror's written proposal. The Government reserves the right to contact other government and commercial sources to validate information submitted in a proposal and to assess capability, past performance and responsibility.<br />(c) Proposals, which are unrealistic in terms of price, will be deemed reflective of an inherent lack of technical competence or indicative of a failure to comprehend the complexity and risks of the proposed contract. Such proposals may be rejected as unacceptable without further discussions. In addition, the Government reserves the right to eliminate from consideration those proposals so deficient in information as to require a major re-write or revision in order to become acceptable.<br />(d) The technical evaluation factors and other factors other than price, when combined, are approximately equal to price. Price will not be a numerically weighted factor in the evaluation of proposals. If the two or more highest rated technical proposals are considered to be essentially equal in terms of technical competence, price may become the determinative factor in making an award.<br />(e) The Government reserves the right to award a contract on the basis of evaluation of the original submission without discussions or call for Final Proposal Revisions. The contract will be awarded as a firm fixed price contract using simplified acquisition procedures.<br />Proposals should be written AND NOT EXCEED TEN (10) PAGES and submitted in a legible format. Proposals must fully address Past Performance. No reference to Price shall be included in the Proposal. Proposals must contain the contractor's Tax Information Number, and DUNS Number.

1.	Title of Project:  Inventory and mapping of Bay Pines HCS underground   communication system.

2.	Scope of Work:  Vendor will provide all labor, material and technical expertise to survey, identify, and map all communications cabling in the Bay Pines HCS signal manhole system and building entry points.  This system consists of  app.30 manholes and app. 20 buildings with multiple entry points on the US Dept of Veterans Affairs property located at 10000 Bay Pines Blvd, Bay Pines Fl 33744.  The vendor will enter each manhole, Junction Box and Crawl space to identify the existing cables, fibers and the capacity and size of each conduit entering and exiting each manhole and buildings, to include pathways for building to building.  The vendor will enter each building and identify the type of each cable & fibers and its spare capacity at all entry points. Labeling and identifying of cable will be part of the identifying process.  The survey will locate the manhole by GPS coordinates obtaining the longitude and latitude and these coordinates shall be put on a layer within the VA site plan in AUTOCAD format.  The vendor will remove all un- identified abandoned cables or fibers from the manholes to building entry point.

Once the survey has been completed all information will be documented in AUTOCAD version 2011 format and with AIA symbols and layers:

The General Services Administration, as the Contracting Agency for The Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Inspector General as the Requiring Agency, is conducting Market Research to determine the extent to which competing a requirement will result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition. </span></p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'">In 2008, the HUD OIG through its Information Technology support contractor, competed a requirement to provide telecommunications and server hosting support for the network and disaster recovery servers, provide dashboard reporting of network status, and provide a network that supported IPv6 and provided VPN access.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The change was required to separate the HUD OIG telecommunications and Information Technology services from the HUD telecommunications and Information Technology services. A Request for Proposals was issued to three (3) vendors, quotes were received from two (2), and Verizon was awarded the subcontract.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The initial start date of the Verizon subcontract was October 15, 2008 and it will end on May 6, 2011.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government intends to award a follow-on contract to Verizon, or one of its subsidiary companies, on a non-competitive basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;<br /></span></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><br />Under 41 U.S.C. &sect;253(c), an executive agency may use procedures other than competitive procedures if the services needed by the executive agency are available from only one responsible source and no other type of property or services will satisfy the needs of the executive agency.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This exception applies in the case of a follow-on requirement for the continued production of a major system when it is likely that award to a source other than the original source would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition, or unacceptable delays in fulfilling the executive agency's needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under such circumstances, the services may be deemed to be available only from the original source and may be procured through procedures other than competitive procedures. <br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><br />A draft version of the Performance Work Statement (PWS), substantially the same as will be included in the intended Verizon follow-on contract, is attached.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any acronyms that follow are defined in the PWS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Awarding a contract to a company other than Verizon to provide the required services as detailed in the PWS will duplicate the cost of migrating the CSF and DRF - a cost the government incurred in late 2008 and early 2009.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The government would also incur the cost of continuing the Verizon services while the new service provider moves and replaces the nationwide circuits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A new service provider would need to install approximately fifty (50) circuits and circuit installation requires approximately forty-five (45) days to complete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The larger and more complex DS3 circuits take much longer than forty-five (45) days to install.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, the router at each of the approximately forty-seven (47) HUD OIG site is specialized equipment owned and managed by Verizon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The routers, along with the circuits, require replacement if a new service provider is selected. It is unlikely that HUD OIG will recoup its transition and duplicative service costs through competitive procedures.&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><br />The Government estimates that the cost of moving the CSF and DRF and buying new routers, circuits, and other equipment, will cost slightly more than one million dollars (~&gt;$1,000,000.00)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Historical data supports a finding that a competitive acquisition will not result in saving more than the cost of moving the CSF and DRF and providing new routers and circuits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, historical data requires the Government to conclude that the HUD OIG will realize delays if it changes from Verizon to a new telecommunications provider and will experience a loss of connectivity among OIG offices possibly lasting for weeks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The loss of connectivity will result in a loss of productivity on significant and important HUD OIG investigations and audits.<br /></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 12pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman','serif'"><br />This Special Notice may be used to support a finding that no source other than Verizon is capable of providing the required services without substantial duplication of cost to the Government which is not expected to be recovered through competition.

Place of Contract Performance: Washington, DC

Set-Aside Status: Total Set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)

Description

The mission of VBA, in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), is to provide benefits and services to Veterans and their families in a responsive, timely, and compassionate manner in recognition of their service to the Nation.

VBA has six lines of business, which deliver services and benefits to Veterans. These are:
o Benefits Assistance Service (BAS)
o Compensation and Pension (C&P)
o Education
o Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)
o Insurance
o Loan Guaranty

For more information regarding these lines of business and the various benefits and services they provide, please visit http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/index.asp.

Each line of business has several unique software applications and systems enabling the establishment, development, and payment of over $47 billion annually  in benefits claims. VBA, in conjunction with VA's Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), is in the process of modifying, upgrading, and replacing a number of these applications and systems, and will likely devote significant effort to such activities throughout the period of performance of this contract. While OI&T is responsible for their development, deployment, and maintenance of applications and systems, VBA is responsible for all business requirements gathering, user testing, training, and organizational change management required to implement new software and hardware, as well as any non-IT support services (e.g., business support services) that provide inputs to system implementation efforts. VBA does not develop any applications or systems internally. Any information technology assets or services associated with these VBA projects will be procured by OI&T using separate contract vehicles.

VBA requires on-site project management support and business analysis services for its staff offices, business lines and affiliate VA organizations.

VBA staff offices, business lines and affiliates (hereafter VBA organizations) require these services to support the business activities  surrounding their management of business initiatives and the design, development, implementation, modification, sustainment and portfolio management of their software applications and systems. Multiple VBA organizations have projects and programs  that currently require such services and as these projects and programs are completed, or as new priorities arise, some VBA organizations may require less support while others may require additional support or support for the first time.

Project management support and business analysis services shall be performed on a firm fixed price and/or labor hour basis. To compensate for the fluid nature of this requirement, this contract will be an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. VBA organizations will independently procure services via task orders (TOs) against this IDIQ contract. Services will be performed by contractors in labor categories defined in Section 4 of this PWS. TOs will specify the number of contractors in each labor category (and therefore the services) needed by the requiring VBA organization, whether the services shall be performed on a firm fixed price or labor hour basis, any required deliverables and any special conditions associated with performance.

Set-Aside Status: Total Set-aside for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB)

The mission of VBA, in partnership with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA), is to provide benefits and services to Veterans and their families in a responsive, timely, and compassionate manner in recognition of their service to the Nation.

VBA has six lines of business, which deliver services and benefits to Veterans. These are:

* Benefits Assistance Service (BAS)
* Compensation and Pension (C&P)
* Education
* Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E)
* Insurance
* Loan Guaranty

For more information regarding these lines of business and the various benefits and services they provide, please visit http://www.vba.va.gov/VBA/index.asp.

Each line of business has several unique software applications and systems enabling the establishment, development, and payment of over $47 billion annually in benefits claims. VBA, in conjunction with VA's Office of Information and Technology (OI&T), is in the process of modifying, upgrading, and replacing a number of these applications and systems, and will likely devote significant effort to such activities throughout the period of performance of this contract. While OI&T is responsible for their development, deployment, and maintenance of applications and systems, VBA is responsible for all business requirements gathering, user testing, training, and organizational change management required to implement new software and hardware, as well as any non-IT support services (e.g., business support services) that provide inputs to system implementation efforts. VBA does not develop any applications or systems internally. Any information technology assets or services associated with these VBA projects will be procured by OI&T using separate contract vehicles.

VBA requires on-site project management support and business analysis services for its staff offices, business lines and affiliate VA organizations.

VBA staff offices, business lines and affiliates (hereafter VBA organizations) require these services to support the business activities surrounding their management of business initiatives and the design, development, implementation, modification, sustainment and portfolio management of their software applications and systems. Multiple VBA organizations have projects and programs that currently require such services and as these projects and programs are completed, or as new priorities arise, some VBA organizations may require less support while others may require additional support or support for the first time.

Project management support and business analysis services shall be performed on a firm fixed price and/or labor hour basis. To compensate for the fluid nature of this requirement, this contract will be an multiple award, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. VBA organizations will independently procure services via task order proposal requests (TOPRs) against this IDIQ contract. Each TOPR will be evaluated based on a price proposal, past performance information and a technical/management plan, then a TO will be subsequently awarded to the ID/IQ Contractor whose TOPR proposal provides best value to the Government.  Services will be performed by contractors in labor categories defined in the Performance Work Statement (PWS) provided in the solicitation. TOPRs will specify the number of contractors in each labor category (and therefore the services) needed by the requiring VBA organization, whether the services shall be performed on a firm fixed price or labor hour basis, any required deliverables and any special conditions associated with performance.

TOs will be aligned with individual VBA organizations and each TO will be managed by a Government Contracting Officer's Technical Representative (COTR) who has direct experience in the business requirement on which the TO is focused.

The Contractor shall perform the work in accordance with this RFQ, the resultant contract, and the detailed individual TOs.

The Government intends to make multiple awards as a result of this solicitation. It is anticipated that the awarded contracts (ID/IQ) will have one 12-month base period with four 12-month options. The solicitation will be issued on or about December 10, 2010 with an anticipated close date of on or about December 27, 2010.

<DESC>This notice is provided for informational purposes only. This opportunity was only available to Palmetto GBA.
<p>The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) modified an existing contract to meet mandates of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009. <br />CMS determined this work is within the scope of an existing contract with Palmetto GBA and therefore, obtained the services required via a modification to the contract with Palmetto GBA. The contract is for the Train the Trainer services and includes the development of training plans and assistance with plan implementation. The contract was modified to obtain education conference calls.</p>
<p>The conference calls will be used to provide training for Fee-for-Service provider community on various aspects of the HITECH legislation in January 2011.</p>
<p>The contract being modified was originally awarded competitively and is a Cost Plus Fixed Fee (CPFF) type contract. Due to the fact that the nature of the work being performed, including the work as modified, is unpredictable in terms of the actual number of participants and duration of the conferences the contract type remains CPFF.</p>

During the month of November 2010, GSA and Lessor came to a mutual agreement on the security system costs. Lessor then notified the Contractor. However, the Lessor and Contractor came to an impasse regarding the terms and conditions of the proposed contract between the Lessor and the Contractor. Lessor then notified GSA that a contract with the security contractor was not feasible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Security Contractor was geared up to start work but now had to cease as a result of the impasse. As a result of not having a security system in their space, SSA has been contracting for 24 hour/7 days a week guard service since September 2010 resulting in expensive costs incurred by SSA (that did not originally budget for the 24 hour guard service). SSA has been expending costs for 24 hour guard service for 3 months as a temporary measure until their security system is installed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>SSA's space must be secured 24 hour/7 days a week due to highly sensitive personnel records/files housed in the SSA office.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></span></p>

It has been determined that due to these uncontrollable circumstances, it is in the best interest of the Government to award the contract to RJ<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Beck Protective Systems (who is familiar with the SOW and was the lowest price from the Lessor bids), would result in the quickest and most cost efficient resolution to SSA's dire need for a security system.</span></p>

<p>I. CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Munitions Contracting Division (RWK), 101 W. Eglin Blvd, Suite 337, Eglin AFB FL 32542-6810.</p>
<p>II. NATURE AND/OR DESCRIPTION OF THE ACTION BEING PROCESSED: This action will be awarded as new firm-fixed-price contract to Santa Barbara InfraRed, Inc., 30 S. Calle Cesar Chaves, Suite D, Santa Barbara, CA 93103.</p>
<p>III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SUPPLIES/SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET THE AGENCY'S NEEDS: Under this contract, Santa Barbara Infrared (SBIR), Inc. will deliver five (5) 512-by-512 element cryogenic infrared emitter array modules for AFRL Munitions Directorate, Advanced Guidance Division, Guidance Simulation Branch (AFRL/RWGG). These modules will integrate emitter arrays that are residual contractor acquired property from a previous cost-plus-fixed-fee AFRL/RW research and development contract with SBIR, Inc. (contract # F08630-02-C-0063). SBIR will also perform functional testing of the packaged arrays to determine basic module operability. With their exclusive technology license and proven manufacturing process, SBIR can complete five (5) spare emitter array modules with the residual government components with low risk, at a fraction of the cost and within acceptable delivery times to support critical testing of major government programs.</p>
<p>The packaged emitter arrays will provide interactive infrared images to seekers during hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) testing. The emitter array will operate down to the required temperature with state-of-the-art radiometric temperature, temporal and spatial characteristics. This allows high fidelity testing of strategic missile defense systems in a laboratory environment. Averting one failed flight test results in over $100M in savings. Ultimately, the hardware-in the-loop testing application of this technology evaluates the effectiveness of future kinetic-kill-vehicle guidance capabilities under many exhaustive scenarios. Estimated Price: $600K; appropriation type: FY10 funding primarily 0400 (Missile Defense Agency (MDA) Research and Development (R&amp;D) funding).</p>
<p>IV. STATUTORY AUTHORITY PERMITTING OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: 10 USC 2304(c)(1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1 (Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements). <br /><br />V. DEMONSTRATION THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S UNIQUE QUALIFICATIONS OR NATURE OF THE ACQUISITION REQUIRES THE USE OF THE AUTHORITY CITED ABOVE (APPLICABILITY OF AUTHORITY): <br />(1) Procurement of these highly specialized packaged emitter arrays fulfills the requirement for spare emitters in critical testing programs. Honeywell, Inc. invented and proved the process required for emitter array technology and holds the exclusive US patents (5,600,148 2/4/1997; 5,973,383 10/26/1999; 6,046,485 4/4/2000; 5,895,233 4/20/1999; 6,036,872 3/14/2000; 6,210,494 4/3/2001). Honeywell sold the exclusive license of this technology for emitter array applications to Santa Barbara Infrared Inc. in June 2001. In August 2002, under a technically competitive Program Research and Development Announcement, MNK-PRDA-02-0004, AFRL/RWK awarded contract F08630-02-C-0063 to SBIR to develop a cryogenic emitting array device with a spatial resolution of 512-by-512. The technical portion of this program, entitled "Optimized Array for Space-Background Infrared Simulation" (OASIS), was successfully completed, and the performance period ended 30 Sep 08.&nbsp;<br /><br />(2) As a result of this earlier program, several emitter wafers were produced as reserves in the event arrays were damaged or failed during cryogenic packaging and testing. These reserve arrays have been stored in a specialized environment since program completion by SBIR, Inc. The intent of this procurement is to complete the assembly of (5) spare emitter arrays using the government owned residual components currently residing at SBIR, Inc. and to supply these modules to critical testing programs that received the original arrays.<br /><br />(3) AFRL/RWGG believes award to any other source would result in both a substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition, and unacceptable delays in fulfilling Department of Defense requirements. The emitters delivered by the original contract include developmental processes and license that are proprietary. The cost to award another contract to develop an alternate specialized cryogenic package with comparable capability is expected to mirror or exceed the original efforts of Contract F08630-02-C-0063, resulting in a 30-month effort and estimated $2M in cost. Delay of this magnitude would seriously degrade testing of next generation missile defense interceptors. &nbsp;Anticipated total cost for SBIR, Inc. to assemble and deliver and test the subject five (5) items is expected to be approximately $600K. The duration of this effort is expected to be 12 months.<br /><br />(4) Accordingly, as SBIR is the only contractor with the exclusive license and unique experience with both the basic 512-x-512 and 1024-x-1024 array device development, SBIR is the only firm capable of providing these packaged devices without the Department of Defense experiencing substantial duplication of costs that could not be expected to be recovered through competition and unacceptable delays in fulfilling its requirements. Thus, 10 USC 2304(c) (1), as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, is the appropriate authority for this action.<br /><br />VI. DESCRIPTION OF EFFORTS MADE TO ENSURE THAT OFFERS ARE SOLICITED FROM AS MANY POTENTIAL SOURCES AS DEEMED PRACTICABLE: <br />Program Research and Development Announcement (PRDA): SBIR, Inc. originally submitted a proposal under MNK-PRDA-02-0004 to develop the OASIS 512 arrays. Contract # F08630-02-C-0063 was awarded and completed in 2008. <br />Other Actions: AFRL/RWGG KHILS facility personnel are recognized experts in the field of infrared scene projection for HWIL testing, and frequently discuss with industry, government and academia the development of relevant test technologies. AFRL/RWGG currently sponsors several R&amp;D contracts to promote competition in this market. These programs include the MDA Small Business Innovative Research contract, "High Dynamic Range Infrared Scene Projector for Boost Phase Intercept" program with Acumen Scientific (contract HQ0006-05-C-7249), the "Extremely High Temperature Projector" program with CYAN Systems, Inc. (contract FA8651-08-C-0060), and the "Novel Infrared Emissive Devices" program with Power Photonic (contract FA8651-07-C-0152). Each of these programs focuses on alternative infrared scene projector technologies. However, none of these technologies is deemed mature enough to meet the performance, cost and schedule goals required by AFRL/RWGG for years to come. This is particularly true in the unique and stressing cryogenic environment.</p>
<p>VII. DETERMINATION BY THE CONTRACTING OFFICER THAT THE ANTICIPATED COST TO THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE FAIR AND REASONABLE: The contractor's proposed costs will be carefully examined and verified to the extent possible using material quotes and cost data. Inputs from the AFRL/RWGG Program Manager (technical and cost evaluation) and DCAA (verification of direct and indirect rates) will be used to establish a negotiation objective. Weighted Guidelines will be used to determine a fair and reasonable fee. Thus, it is expected the resulting negotiated fixed price will be found fair and reasonable prior to award of any contract.</p>
<p>VIII. DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET RESEARCH CONDUCTED AND THE RESULTS, OR A STATEMENT OF THE REASONS MARKET RESEARCH WAS NOT CONDUCTED: As described in Section VI above, market research, in accordance with FAR Part 10, was conducted via FedBizOpps synopsis of the PRDA advising industry of AFRL's interest in development of the OASIS and soliciting proposals from interested parties. SBIR was the only offeror to submit a proposal. Additionally, current expert knowledge of the field as described in Section VI above and the requirement for AFRL/RWGG Program Managers to conduct a new literature search to review all published reports of research on pertinent technological advancements before beginning a new program. The results indicated no other previously conducted research applies to this program.</p>
<p>IX. ANY OTHER FACTS SUPPORTING THE USE OF OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION: <br />Implementation of this technology required SBIR to conduct an exhaustive search of micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) foundries to meet fabrication requirements in the performance of previous contracts with the Army and the Air Force. SBIR has established processes with various foundries to successfully implement the patented process. As a result, SBIR now has years of product development experience with three multimillion-dollar Air Force and Army contracts. Thus, SBIR is well qualified to perform this effort.<br /><br />X. LIST OF SOURCES, IF ANY, THAT EXPRESSED INTEREST IN THE ACQUISITION: See Section VI above. No other sources expressed an interest.</p>
<p>XI. A STATEMENT OF THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE AGENCY MAY TAKE TO REMOVE OR OVERCOME ANY BARRIERS TO COMPETITION BEFORE MAKING SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITIONS FOR THE SUPPLIES OR SERVICES REQUIRED: <br />It is generally understood by AFRL/RWGG as well as the rest of the HWIL community that, barring any revolutionary breakthroughs, SBIR's resistive array technology is approaching its limits in radiometric temperature, temporal and spatial performance. HWIL facilities using infrared scene projectors must continually keep technological pace with the seeker development projects they are responsible for testing. In an attempt to establish alternate technologies and sources (and thereby foster competition), AFRL/RWG sponsors numerous Small Business Innovative Research contracts and also participates in the Centralized Test and Evaluation Instrumentation Program (CTEIP) Science and Technology projects. Examples of these efforts are given in Section VI above. A similar technology development program, contract W91ZLK-06-R-0020 "Next Generation 512 x 512 and 1024 x 1024 Read-In-Integrated Circuits (RIICs) for Infrared (IR) Scene Projection Application" program with Nova Sensors is currently being managed for OSD by the Army's Aberdeen Test Center.</p>
