<CONTACT>SUSAN MCKENNEY CONTRACTING OFFICER 7036487358     ;
<DESC>The U.S. Geological Survey, (ER Science Coordination Office), intends to award a noncompetitive contract to the Pontchartrain Institute, University of New Orleans for "Assessment of the Restoration Potential and sustainability of the Breton National Wildlife Refuge - the Chandeleur Islands."  Breton National Wildlife Refuge was severely impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.  The severity of damage brings into question what the future configuration of the island chain will be, what protective function the islands will provide for the mainland wetlands and New Orleans, and whether the Breton NWR can continue to provide the same level of functional habitat for nesting birds and other wildlife as it did prior to the hurricanes.  University of New Orleans (UNO)-Pontchartrain Institute for Environmental Sciences (PIES) will offer science and technical advice in cooperation with the U.S. Geological Survey to enable the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make practical restoration management decisions.  The work proposed will build on a data effort in which baseline bathymetry and topography are currently being collected and analyzed under support from the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources and USGS.  The work  will include shoreline, topographic/bathymetric change, geologic framework and sediment resource potential, and modeling to project island response to various restoration alternatives.  USGS Gulf Coast Science Coordination Office is located on the University of New Orleans campus.  Further, the USGS (particularly the St. Petersburg and Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Geology Centers) have been cooperating with the PIES group at UNO for the past several years under joint LA DNR and supplemental Hurricane Katrina funding.  This new work will build on this past effort by utilizing data already collected and joint vessels and equipment required for marine surveying and coring planned for  summer 2007.  The UNO investigators possess a vital understanding of the complex geologic history and processes that represent the Louisiana and northern Gulf of Mexico coast.  Their experience and local expertise will be crucial to the successful completion of the project goals.  The particular investigators are expert in the fields required for this project:  Dr. Shea Penland (coastal and shoreline change), Dr. Mark Kulp (coastal framework geology and stratigraphy), Dr. Iannis Georgio (modeling including ADCIRC and Delft 3D).  The period of performance will be from date of award through the end of two years thereafter.  See Numbered Note 22.

The U.S. Geological Survey, Water Resources Discipline, Upper-Midwest Environmental Science Center(UMESC), LaCrosse, WI, has a construction requirement of labor, materials, and equipment for the removal of two existing carbon adsorption towers, and the installation of two(2) new carbon adsorption towers installed and successfully placed as replacements.   Throughout the duration of construction activities, the effluent treatment system must continue to operate in support of ongoing UMESC research activities.  Therefore, the removal and successful replacement of the first carbon adsorption tower must be completed and successfully put into operation before the second carbon adsorption tower is taken out of service for replacement.  In addition to the replacement of two activated adsorption towers, this project also involves the replacement of two roof hatches, as well as, fabricating support for piping, valves, conduit, etc, to maintain the existing equipment in place without damage during demolition.  Once demolition is completed, installation of permanent piping and unistrut supports will be required to support the piping, valves, conduit, etc, in their current location. The estimated magnitude of this requirement is between $100,000.00 and $200,000.00. This is a requirement under the Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program; all responsible sources who have a valid DUN and Bradstreet Number may submit a proposal. The anticipated request for proposal (RFP) release date is 06/13/2007 with award expected by 06/20/2007.  The NAICS is 238220.

<SUBJECT>99--Tower Simulation System - Industry Day 2
<SOLNBR>5682
<RESPDATE>052307
<ARCHDATE>06222007
<CONTACT>Ryan King, 202-267-7851
<DESC>BACKGROUND: Previous announcements regarding this program can be found on the FAA Contract Opportunities website (http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm) by searching for "Tower Simulation" in the search "by keyword" field.  Be sure to check the "Include Archive" checkbox to view all announcements.  PURPOSE: This purpose of this announcement is to provide the time, date and location for Industry Day 2.  Industry Day 2 will take on May 23, 2007 beginning at 7:30AM San Antonio time (Central).  The airport address is below: San Antonio International Airport 9434 Airport Blvd San Antonio, TX 78216 All attendees must make their way to the parking lot surrounding the tower.  In the parking lot is a guard shack where attendee names and identities will be confirmed by security.  The entrance to the tower is on the west side of the terminal loop.  Attendees may use the either the previously stated parking lot which surrounds the tower or the general airport paid parking area.  To reach the tower one will travel nearly the entire length of the Airport Blvd loop passing both terminals before reaching the tower.  Using Mapquest or Google Maps with the airport address above will show the general location of the tower.  The following website for San Antonio Airport also provides general airport information including maps (http://www.sanantonio.gov/aviation/).  As a last resort attendees may contact the facility (POC: John Reagan) at 210-805-5507 for assistance with directions and entry to the facility.  This number and POC are provided solely for the purpose of obtaining assistance with directions and entry to the facility.  Vendors may not use this contact information for any other purposes.   IMPORTANT NOTICES REGARDING INDUSTRY DAY 2: Unlike Industry Day 1, Industry Day 2 is not merely a question and answer session.  Although termed an "Industry Day", the main purpose of Industry Day 2 is to provide vendors appropriate access to an airport facility in order to obtain the visual and other information necessary to prepare for and deliver the product demonstration portion of the proposal for this procurement.  The product demonstration will take place 6-8 weeks after the Industry Day 2.  Industry Day 2 is intended solely for vendors that intend to participate in this procurement that have a viable product with which to carry out a demonstration using their own equipment within the 6-8 week timeframe.   As stated in the "Tower Simulation System - Update" announcement posted May 4, 2007, vendors must provide their intent to attend Industry Day 2 within two days after release of the SIR or Draft SIR.  The SIR or a Draft SIR will be released the week of May 13.  Whether the SIR or a Draft SIR is posted, the announcement synopsis will specify when the two day deadline for providing intent ends.  Vendors are asked not to provide intent prior to release of the SIR or Draft SIR. Also as stated in the "Tower Simulation System - Update" announcement posted May 4, 2007, vendor teams/partnerships or prime/subcontractor arrangements may not have more than three representatives at Industry Day 2.  It is imperative that each vendor team/partnership or prime/subcontractor arrangement provide not more than three representatives as there is limited space at the airport facility.    For security reasons only U.S. citizens will be allowed to enter the premises and therefore take part in Industry Day 2. The package containing airport information will be provided on CD to vendors at Industry Day 2.  A schedule for the day will also be provided at the industry day.   Vendors are cautioned that the investment of time, money and resources necessary to develop this database and later perform a demonstration of the scenario using their own simulator equipment is solely at the vendor's risk.  FAA will not reimburse vendors for any costs associated with the demonstration. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: This announcement is not intended to guarantee procurement of these services, and shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  This is not a request for proposal.  The Government is not liable for any costs incurred for the simulator demonstration or the development of a written proposal. Additionally, the Government is not liable for any costs associated with the preparation and submittal of inquiries or responses to this announcement and will not reimburse any firm for costs incurred responding to this public announcement or as a result of the Industry Days. Until further notice all updates and announcements related to this procurement will be communicated via the FAA Contract Opportunities website (http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm) which was used to post this announcement.  Vendors are responsible for monitoring this website for updates to this procurement.

<DESC>NASA/ARC has a requirement for a Sole Source to the Radiation Oncology Department of the University of California Davis Medical Center for costs associated with the collection of samples from radiotherapy patients and unexposed controls.  NASA/ARC intends to purchase the items from the University of California Davis Medical Center, Sponsored Programs, One Shields Avenue, 118 Everson Hall, Davis, CA  95616-5270 pursuant to FAR 6.302-1.   University of California Davis Medical Center (UCD) and NASA/Ames Research Center (ARC) has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for this project.  The samples will be collected at UCD by their responsible medical staff and transported to ARC for analysis using genomics and other analytical capabilities.  Sample types shall be agreed upon between ARC and UCD.  UCD have a qualified staff to do this project.  Radiation exposure is one of the biggest challenges facing astronauts during extended lunar and Mars space missions under the Presidents Space Exploration Initiative. This effort would benefit NASA by providing invaluable information of the human effects of radiation exposure that could lead to an early warning system of efficient biomarkers necessary to protect crew health. Results from such studies would also help NASA develop suitable limits for crew radiation exposure, protective protocols, and radiation countermeasures.  In addition, these studies would help earth-bound radiotherapy patients and workers exposed to dangerous radioactive environments avoid overexposure and irreversible radiation damage. Biomarkers developed under such research could lead to earlier cancer detection, thus saving lives and decreasing health care costs. This project is also consistent with NASAs technology development goals under the Innovative Technology Partnership Program. This study will require both UCD and ARC IRB approval.  Such approval will be obtained prior to beginning sample collection.  UCD will not be calculating the cost on a per-sample basis; rather the money will be used to support the salary of the data manager. The statement of work is as follows:  1)  Work with ARC on specific sample types which will generally involve blood lymphocytes, buccal cells, and other minimally invasive samples. 2)  Extracting RNA and possibly DNA from patients and control subjects to be selected jointly by ARC and UCD scientists and physicians. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested parties having the capabilities and qualifications necessary to meet or exceed the stated requirements are invited to submit appropriate documentation, literature, brochures, and references. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. All responses shall be submitted to Patricia Finnell-Mendoza no later than 4:30 PM PST on 05/22/2007. Responses may be mailed to the following address: NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER Attn: Patricia Finnell-Mendoza M/S 241-1 Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000.

<DESC>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters is releasing a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for foundational research in support of the Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate (ARMD). NNH07ZEA001N, entitled "Research Opportunities in Aeronautics will be available on or about May 31, 2007, by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/	and then linking through the menu listings "Solicitations" to "Open Solicitations." This NASA Research Announcement (NRA) solicits foundational research proposals for the four programs within ARMD: the Airspace Systems Program, the Aviation Safety Program, the Fundamental Aeronautics Program and the Aeronautics Test Program. The Airspace Systems Program will directly address the Air Traffic Management (ATM) research needs of the Next Generation Air Transportation Systems (NGATS) initiative as defined by the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO). The Aviation Safety Program will take a proactive approach to address safety challenges of new and legacy vehicles in order to enhance the safety of the Nations current and future air transportation system. The Fundamental Aeronautics Program will pursue long-term, cutting edge research in all flight regimes to produce data, knowledge, and design tools that will be applicable across a broad range of air vehicles. The Aeronautics Test Program, residing under NASAs Shared Capability Assets Program (SCAP), will protect and preserve key aeronautics test facilities. The structure of the ROA NRA will require that proposals be submitted to the most relevant aeronautics program elements, which will be described in Appendices to the NRA. Specific Proposal submission deadline dates, any particular evaluation criteria, and submission points of contact by NASA Center will also be identified in the NRA Appendices.  Proposals must be submitted electronically, and all proposers may use NASAs proposal data system, NSPIRES (http://nspires.nasaprs.com     ), or Grants.gov. Electronic submission of proposals is required, and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. With the exception of government organizations and Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs), participation is open to all categories of organizations, including educational institutions, industry and nonprofit organizations. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. Each electronic proposal system places requirements on the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Further information about specific program elements may be obtained from the individual Program Officers listed in the Summary of Key Information for each program element in this NRA, while questions concerning general NRA policies and procedures may be directed to Jay Dryer, Senior Technical Advisor, NASA Headquarters, Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate, email: NASA-roa@nasa.gov.

NASA/MSFC has a requirement for a Robot System for Application of Spray-On Foam Insulation. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Fanuc Robotics America, Inc. on a sole source basis. Fanuc robots are currently being utilized at MSFC and MAF for the application of Spray-On Foam Insulation materials and other processes.	Personnel involved in this effort are experienced with the programming and use of Fanuc robots.  Baseline processes developed with existing Fanuc robots at MSFC facilities will be utilized to assist with the development of replacement materials and processes.  The utilization of similar robor systems will reduce the variation of these comparisons, reducing the amount of effort needed to ensure comparable results. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Judith Drabkin at Judith.R.Drabkin@nasa.gov or fax 256-544-4401 no later than 4:30 p.m.CST local time on May 25, 2007.

<DESC>The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Office of Wetland, Oceans & Watersheds (OWOW), Assessment and Watershed Protection Division (AWPD) is seeking to enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement for contractor support for laboratory services in support of the National Lakes Survey project.  The National Lakes Survey project assessment is being undertaken to generate statistically valid estimates of the biological health of lakes across the country. Tasks under this requirement will include: (1) Conducting laboratory analysis of phytoplankton populations including identification and enumeration using a specific methodology that was adapted from the ?Protocol for the Analysis of Algal Samples collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Water-Quality Assessment program? (Charles et al., 2003).  This methodology involves microscopic examination of preserved phytoplankton samples collected.  Laboratories must use the inverted microscope method as described in the ?Survey of the Nation?s Lakes Laboratory Methods Manual (LMM)?.  Sample preparation, necessary materials and equipment, and analytical procedures are described in the LMM.   (2) Adhering to the strict quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) requirements of the EPA?s ?Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  (3) Providing logistical support by receiving, logging and storing field samples received.  (4) Adhering to sample tracking procedures and ensuring that the reporting of all required data, calculations, and results is accomplished within the designated times, on the designated forms, and is submitted via any designated data management system.   The successful small business laboratory will receive pre-labled samples on a regular basis during the project period.  Preserved samples are to be processed, enumerated, and identified (at the 300 organism level), with the exception of diatoms, to the lowest possible taxonomic level (generally genus) using agreed upon standard keys and references.  The contractor shall also maintain a reference library/voucher collection using digital imagery.  The EPA anticipates awarding a single Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under this solicitation.  The BPA will establish a fixed rate for each sample analysis.  The BPA will establish an ordering period of four (4) months.  Over this four month period, EPA estimates a total of between 1150 and 1300 analysis will be required.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) require an offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after BPA award will also be a part of the solicitation.   THIS REQUIREMENT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The applicable NAICS code is: 541380 with a size standard of $11 million.  The projected start date is June 1, 2007.  The solicitation is expected to be posted to FedBizOpps on or about May 2, 2007 as Solicitation Number PR-CI-07-10632.  No hard copies of the solicitation shall be provided.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The United States Army Communications-Electronic Life Cycle Management Command (C-E LCMC) intends to award a new work modification to contract W15P7T-02-C-L421 on a non-competitive basis in support of the Multi-Mission Radar(MMR). The anticipated awa rd will be made under the Authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and FAR 6.302-1, Only One Responsible Source, to Syracuse Research Corporation (SRC), North Syracuse, NY. The Multi-Mission Radar Advanced Technology Objective (MMR-ATO) is a unique radar system w here only one system exists within the Department of Defense.   The prime contractor, SRC, has designed, fabricated, tested and demonstrated the system from its inception. Their staff is uniquely qualified to properly maintain and operate the system either  in a laboratory or field environment.  The Government project office has no such capability.  The only course of action open to the project office would be to secure training by SRC to operate and maintain the system, which is not feasible for the timelin e needed.  In addition, that effort would be out of scope of the contract and not cost effective for an estimated four additional demonstrations.  SRC would conduct all demonstrations providing the greatest potential for the MMR-ATO program to experience s uccess.  SRCs knowledge of the system and their technical capabilities will aid in any effort in identifying improvements to the system that will greatly benefit the technology transfer to a future program office.  The additional effort is expected to hav e a period of performance of approximately 12 months. A tracking number W15P7T-07-R-P442 has been assigned to this effort and should be reference along with contract number W15P7T-02-C-L421. TECHNICAL questions should be addressed to Mr. Steven Wagner; ema il steven.wagner@us.army.mil, (732) 532-4095.

IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISITION MAY BE  SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought for planning  purposes only. TITLE /DESCRIPTION:  Replace Failed SCADA System, Project Number 050011.  This project replaces the remote monitoring and control system,  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for the primary  electrical power distribution system located at WPAFB.  This system  consists of power sensors, relays, remote terminal units, and the  interconnecting control conductors in 9 substations located throughout the  base.  It also consists of a front end computer system located in one  central facility along with other remote monitoring sites.  This project  requires very specialized equipment and computer programming to result in  a fully functional SCADA system.  The SCADA system monitors the entire  primary electrical distribution system, and allows for complete control of  that system. DOLLAR VALUE:  $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: The SCADA system monitors and controls the  primary electrical distribution system for all of WPAFB.  The contract  requires the installation of highly specialized hardware controlled by  custom written computer code.  It requires the correct installation of  thousands of control conductors, hundreds of relays, and hundreds of  sensors. Mistakes can cause unscheduled power outages to multiple  facilities throughout the base, and can be difficult to trace to  eliminate.  Each unscheduled power outage has a large financial impact to  the base, and the primary electrical distribution system is the most  critical utility system of all. PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  365 days Prime contractors who are HUBZone and/or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a  bid for this solicitation MUST submit the following by 2:00 p.m. (local  Dayton time) on 21 May 2007: (1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this  solicitation as a Prime Contractor; (2) date of HUBZone and/or SDVOSB certification; (3) listing of experience in work similar in type and scope that you  identified to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts,  and points of contact with their current phone numbers; (4) evidence of capability to be bonded for bid, performance and payment  bonds; and (5) if you are a HUBZone considering a joint venture, you will need to  provide proof that this consideration has been forwarded to the cognizant  SBA office for approval.

TITLE /DESCRIPTION:  Rpr 2nd Floor Fire Suppression/HVAC  PH II ABW HQ,  Project Number ZHTV 050033B.  This project renovates the interior and  installs fire suppression that doesnt currently exist.  It includes  complete replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm  is so outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The  requirement for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The  renovation will correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room  with inadequate egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a  more efficient use of space. DOLLAR VALUE:  $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors.

This is a  request for information only as defined in FAR 15.201(e).  Responses to  this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to  form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all  expenses associated with responding to this RFI. The Government is in need of information on potential sources for a  contractor support contract for the B-2 Training System. Responses to this  RFI will support the development of an acquisition strategy for a contract  to supplant the current B-2 TSCLS contract (F33657-98-D-0005). B-2 Training System (TS) Components The B-2 TS provides aircrew, maintenance, and weapons loading training at  Whiteman Air Force Base, MO.  It includes training devices, software,  courseware, academic materials, and support elements (hardware, software,  support equipment, spares, and documentation) necessary to train B-2  aircrews, maintenance personnel, and weapons load crews, and to keep the  system current with the fielded aircraft.  The B-2 Training System  consists of the following: the Aircrew Training System (ATS) consisting of  Weapons System Trainers (WSTs) and Mission Trainers (MTs); the Maintenance  Training System (MTS) consisting of Cockpit Procedures Trainers (CPTs),  which are used for both aircrew and maintenance training, Computerized  Maintenance Training System (CMTS) suites each with six Weapon System  Training Aids (WSTAs), a Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer, a Flight  Control Systems Trainer (FSCT), and a Weapons Loading Trainer.  The B-2  Training System also includes a Training System Support Center (TSSC)  which provides on-site sustaining engineering support activities for the  training system.  There is also a Training System Center (TSC), located at  the contractors facility, to handle any software updates to the  maintenance training system. There are 58 devices as follows: Device	                    Number    Location	        Location Weapon System Trainer	    3	      Whiteman AFBMission  Trainer	            2	      Whiteman AFB (1)  Contractors Facility (1) Cockpit Procedures Trainer  8	      Whiteman AFB (4)	Contractors Facility  (4) Computerized Maintenance Training System                            6	      Whiteman AFB (5)	Contractors Facility (1) Weapon System Training Aid 36	      Whiteman AFB (30)	Contractors  Facility (6) Crew Escape System Maintenance Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Flight Control System Trainer                            1	      Whiteman AFB Weapons Loader Trainer	    1	      Whiteman AFBTotal  Devices	           58Services Anticipated The anticipated need for the B-2 TS will include: field services for  training systems, academic instruction, training system contractor  logistics support, and concurrency management and software and systems  engineering.  The effort will include work associated with Distributed  Mission Operations (DMO), the Radar Modernization Program (RMP), and the  Extremely High Frequency (EHF) SatCom Program, as well as future efforts  needed to maintain training system concurrency with the jet. DMO For DMO, the B-2 Weapon System Trainers and Mission Trainers will connect  into the DMO Network (DMON) via a portal provided by Northrop Grumman  Mission Systems (NGMS), the DMO Operations and Integration contractor, and  will have to meet the Combat Air Forces (CAF) DMO Interoperability  Standards.  The contractor will be responsible for ensuring that the WST  design achieves and maintains compliance with DMO System Standards as they  evolve. RMP The B-2 RMP modifies the radar system to operate in a different, approved  radar frequency band.  The B-2 RMP does not provide new capability;  however, it is forcing changes to the aircrew and maintenance training  systems. EHF Satellite Communications (SATCOM) The B-2 EHF SATCOM and Computer Upgrade Program provides a secure, command  and control EHF communications system that ensures the interconnectivity  with a survivable communications link in either a nuclear or conventional  combat-stressed environment at all times throughout the mission. The  Training System will have to evolve in step with the changes being made to  the jet. Security Contractors will be required to have a secure facility.  Personnel working  on the B-2 Training System are required to have security clearances. Contract Items Effort for the B-2 Training System is desired to begin 1 January 2009  (immediately after the current contract expires on 31 December 2008). The Government anticipates a 10-year service delivery period. The B-2 Training System will remain at Whiteman Air Force Base, MO, where  it will be operated and maintained under Contractor Support.  The customer  at Whiteman is Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Education and Training  Command (AETC). CONTRACTOR CAPABILITY SURVEY B-2 Training System Part I.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Water, Office of Wetland, Oceans & Watersheds (OWOW), Assessment and Watershed Protection Division (AWPD) is seeking to enter into a Blanket Purchase Agreement for contractor support for laboratory services in support of the National Lakes Survey project.  The National Lakes Survey project assessment is being undertaken to generate statistically valid estimates of the biological health of lakes across the country. Tasks under this requirement will include: (1) Conducting laboratory analysis of phytoplankton populations including identification and enumeration using a specific methodology that was adapted from the- Protocol for the Analysis of Algal Samples collected as part of the U.S. Geological Survey Water-Quality Assessment program (Charles et al., 2003).  This methodology involves microscopic examination of preserved phytoplankton samples collected.  Laboratories must use the inverted microscope method as described in the Survey of the Nations Lakes Laboratory Methods Manual (LMM).  Sample preparation, necessary materials and equipment, and analytical procedures are described in the LMM.   (2) Adhering to the strict quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) requirements of the EPAs Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP).  (3) Providing logistical support by receiving, logging and storing field samples received.  (4) Adhering to sample tracking procedures and ensuring that the reporting of all required data, calculations, and results is accomplished within the designated times, on the designated forms, and is submitted via any designated data management system.   The successful small business laboratory will receive pre-labled samples on a regular basis during the project period.  Preserved samples are to be processed, enumerated, and identified (at the 300 organism level), with the exception of diatoms, to the lowest possible taxonomic level (generally genus) using agreed upon standard keys and references.  The contractor shall also maintain a reference library/voucher collection using digital imagery.  The EPA anticipates awarding a single Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) under this solicitation.  The BPA will establish a fixed rate for each sample analysis.  The BPA will establish an ordering period of eighteen (18) months.  Over this eighteen month period, EPA estimates a total of between 1150 and 1300 analysis will be required.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provisions (EPAAR 1552.209-70 and 1552.209-72) require an offeror certify that it is unaware of any potential conflict of interest or disclose any potential conflict of interest which may impact their ability to impartially conduct work under the solicitation.  The standard EPAAR solicitation provision (EPAAR 1552.209-71) requiring a contractor to make full disclosure of any actual or potential conflict of interest discovered after BPA award will also be a part of the solicitation.   THIS REQUIREMENT IS A TOTAL SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE.  The applicable NAICS code is: 541380 with a size standard of $11 million.  The projected start date is June 1, 2007.  The solicitation is expected to be posted to FedBizOpps on or about May 2, 2007 as Solicitation Number PR-CI-07-10632.  No hard copies of the solicitation shall be provided.  It is the responsibility of the offerors to frequently check the FedBizOpps website for updates or changes.  All responsible small business sources may submit a proposal which shall be considered by the agency.  See Numbered Note: 1.

PSYCHROMETER WITH CASE, SLING, POCKET TYPE:  Shall have the following characteristics:

This description covers a psychrometer to be used for determining relative humidity of atmospheric air by means of wet- and dry-bulb temperature readings.

Materials.  Corrosion-resistant metal shall be used wherever possible. Any metal causing galvanic action shall be avoided. The thermometer stem shall be standard glass.

Design and construction.  The sling psychrometer shall be furnished complete with two identical mercurial thermometers (mounted parallel) on a metal base, one installed wick, chain, handle, and a calculator. See figures 1 and 2. The components shall be inserted into a plastic pocket case with a plastic or metal insert; the instructions may be inserted into or secured around the case.

Thermometer.  Shall consist of a stem, expansion space, bulb, mercury indicator and a button top. The top of the stem shall be covered by a plastic or rubber sleeve or covering so that the clip (item #5 on figure 2) does not have direct contact with the glass.

Thermometer range and graduation.  The temperature range shall include 30 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, graduated in 1 degree increments. The scale graduations shall be etched or permanent stain imprinted in the glass in whole degrees. The graduation lines shall be clear cut, straight and perpendicular to the axis of the stem. The minor graduation lines shall lie to the left of the axis and shall terminate in line with the axis. The 5 and 10 degree lines shall extend across the axis to the right. The graduations shall be numbered at each multiple of 10 degrees.

Handle and sling.  Shall be provided with a 3-3/4 inch long by 5/16 inch in diameter, partly knurled corrosion-resistant metal handle that shall be attached to a 4 inch section of corrosion-resistant metal chain. This shall be attached to the thermometer frame.

Length.  The total length of the bulb and stem shall be 4-3/4 ??1/8 inch. Minimum length of graduated portion shall be 2-1/4 inches.

Pigment.  All etched graduations and numerals shall be filled with black pigment.

Stain.  Permanent stain imprinting on the glass stem is permissible. Imprinted data shall be sharp and clear.

Wick.  The wick shall be chemically clean muslin or bleached cotton sewn or woven into a tubular shape. The wick shall be of sufficient length to completely cover the exposed thermometer bulb with enough additional length to allow the wick to be secured. The wick shall be tied above and below the bulb with thread, tight enough that it cannot be removed.

Pocket case.  Each psychrometer shall be furnished with a plastic pocket case, fitted with a protective metal or plastic insert, and designed to protect the complete instrument, including the handle and chain.

Calculator.  Shall be provided with a plastic calculator for determining the relative humidity.

Workmanship.  Each psychrometer shall be free from defects that impair their durability, appearance or serviceability.

Test procedures.

Thermometer accuracy.  A standard test thermometer of which the calibration is known to be within 0.1 ?aF over the operating range of thermometers to be tested shall be used as references for the accuracy testing. The reference thermometer shall be placed centrally among the thermometers being tested and immersed to top of liquid column in a liquid bath being constantly agitated. Both the reference and test thermometers shall have their bulbs placed at approximately the same level in the bath. The temperature of the liquid bath shall be held constant to ??0.1 ?aF of the test point selected. Data shall not be recorded until the temperature stabilizes.

The thermometers to be tested shall be compared with the reference thermometer in an ice bath and at a series of points taken over the entire range. Test points shall be selected such that the uppermost and lowermost points fall within 0.5 ?aF of the end points of the specified ranges and the interval between consecutive test points shall not be closer than 10 scale divisions and no further apart than 50 scale divisions. An ice point should always be included as one of the test points, where the range of the thermometer covers an ice point. The thermometer shall indicate true temperature with the tolerance of ??0.5 ?aF. The change in error for an interval of 20 ?aF shall be no greater than 0.5 ?aF on any part of the scale. The change in ice point during a 90 day period shall be not more than ??0.1 ?aF. Each pair of thermometers furnished with a psychrometer shall be in agreement within 0.5 ?aF throughout their range. The maximum allowable error shall be ??1.0 ?aF.

Expansion space.  The thermometer shall be immersed completely for five minutes in a water bath having a temperature of 130 ??0.5 ?aF.  The thermometer shall then be cooled in air to ambient temperature. After this test, the thermometer shall indicate true temperature within ??0.5 ?aF.

Handle/sling test.  A one pound weight shall be attached to the sling in place of the psychrometer. The weight shall be rotated about the handle at a rate of approximately 3 revolutions per second for ten seconds. At completion of the test, there shall be no damage to the handle or sling.

IF ADEQUATE RESPONSES ARE NOT RECEIVED, THE ACQUISITION  MAY BE SOLICITED ON AN UNRESTRICTED BASIS. This is a sources sought for  planning purposes only. TITLE /DESCRIPTION:  Replace Failed SCADA System, Project Number 050011.  This project replaces the remote monitoring and control system,  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), for the primary  electrical power distribution system located at WPAFB.  This system  consists of power sensors, relays, remote terminal units, and the  interconnecting control conductors in 9 substations located throughout the  base.  It also consists of a front end computer system located in one  central facility along with other remote monitoring sites.  This project  requires very specialized equipment and computer programming to result in  a fully functional SCADA system.  The SCADA system monitors the entire  primary electrical distribution system, and allows for complete control of  that system. DOLLAR VALUE:  $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: The SCADA system monitors and controls the  primary electrical distribution system for all of WPAFB.  The contract  requires the installation of highly specialized hardware controlled by  custom written computer code.  It requires the correct installation of  thousands of control conductors, hundreds of relays, and hundreds of  sensors. Mistakes can cause unscheduled power outages to multiple  facilities throughout the base, and can be difficult to trace to  eliminate.  Each unscheduled power outage has a large financial impact to  the base, and the primary electrical distribution system is the most  critical utility system of all. PERFORMANCE PERIOD:  365 days Prime contractors who are HUBZone and/or SDVOSB and who intend to submit a  bid for this solicitation MUST submit the following by 2:00 p.m. (local  Dayton time) on 20 May 2007: (1) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this  solicitation as a Prime Contractor; (2) date of HUBZone and/or SDVOSB certification; (3) listing of experience in work similar in type and scope that you  identified to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts,  and points of contact with their current phone numbers; (4) evidence of capability to be bonded for bid, performance and payment  bonds; and (5) if you are a HUBZone considering a joint venture, you will need to  provide proof that this consideration has been forwarded to the cognizant  SBA office for approval.

TITLE /DESCRIPTION:  Rpr 2nd Floor Fire Suppression/HVAC  PH II ABW HQ,  Project Number ZHTV 050033B.  This project renovates the interior and  installs fire suppression that doesnt currently exist.  It includes  complete replacement of the HVAC and electrical systems.  The fire alarm  is so outdated it cannot be repaired and requires replacement.  The  requirement for fire suppression/detection carries an FSD 3.  The  renovation will correct life safety deficiencies such as a conference room  with inadequate egress.  The project will reconfigure spaces to provide a  more efficient use of space. DOLLAR VALUE:  $1,000,000 to $5,000,000 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS/CONCERNS: No fire suppression currently exists and  fire alarms are unreliable.  Work is necessary to bring the Wing  Headquarters building into compliance with Life Safety Code, Handicapped  Access and to reconfigure spaces to provide a more efficient use of space.  HVAC and electrical systems require revitalization due to age and addition  of ADP equipment.  HVAC has failed on several occasions requiring  temporary heaters and A/C to be brought in until repairs could be made.  The system has been repaired several times but is not expected to be  reliable in the future.  The mechanical system will remain in operation to  serve the first floor.  The first floor will remain occupied by the Wing  Command Section and ASC/JA during construction.  This will require the  contractor to provide temporary rigging for the demolition and material  delivery.  All first floor accesses will have to be maintained during the  construction.  There will be numerous occasions where the contractor will  need to stop performing work to accommodate special events and  distinguished visitors.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) is conducting a market research/industry day to determine the availability of commercial off-the-shelf next generation small form factor (SFF) communication devices that provide increased situational awareness and tactical decision-making capabilities down to small unit leaders.  MCWL is interested in identifying leading edge, state-of-the-art technologies needed to maintain command and control capabilities in a dismounted, dispersed environment.  The Government is focused primarily on seeking suitable turn-key commercial technologies capable of interoperating with other existing Government C2 systems.  Suitable products identified from this event may be considered as candidate technologies to participate in the MCWL Limited Objective Experiment (LOE-4) currently scheduled for October 2008/ Location and Length of Experimentation to be determined. Guidelines for next generation SFF communication device includes: -	Small hand-held form-fit communication device delivering high power output with minimal weight association  -	Capable of transmitting and receiving Voice, Data, and Video/Imagery and or a minimum throughput of 56Kbps -	May be multi-band capable -	May be spread spectrum -	May have embedded GPS -	Must have a minimum threshold range of 1 kilometer and an Objective Range up to 10 kilometers  -	May be interoperable with legacy C4 technologies -	Must have data interfaces to enable the transfer of information to and from external computing devices via industry standards including, but not limited to 802.3 and 802.x -	Required training to setup and operate must not exceed 30 minutes Concept of Operations: MCWL is interested in providing small unit leaders, regardless of their location, the ability to securely and rapidly access and transfer voice, data, video/imagery and Position Location Information (PLI) throughout the battle-space. This would facilitate the gathering of information quickly, accurately, and selectively; it should be the pathway for providing the right information in a timely manner to the right person, in the right place, and in the right form.  This inherent ability, organic to the user, must not place additional burden on the users combat load.   MCWL will host an Industry Day from 4-8 June 2008 at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) Dahlgren.  The Government will provide an overview of the current C4 requirements in the realm of Distributed Operations on 4 June at 0800-1000 in the JDs training center, building 216, Room #116, 6302 Welsh Road, Dahlgren, VA 22448. Interested companies shall submit to the Government an informational document describing their technologies in relation to the guidelines listed above. This document shall be no more than fifteen (15) pages in adobe acrobat format 7.0. This document shall clearly identify operating frequencies, max-power output, modulation, and antenna types/gain, if a demonstration is desired.  The Government encourages timely, concise, and accurate responses. The Government will review the informational documents and schedule one-on-one conferences with interested parties during the period 5-8 June 2007 at JDs training center (NSWC) Dahlgren. In addition the Government will provide industry the opportunity to demonstrate proposed technologies during the time period mentioned above. Each meeting will last no more than 1 hour, followed by a 1 hour demonstration, if applicable.  Due to space limitations interested parties are requested to limit attendance to no more then 3 personnel. The Government will not entertain sales, marketing, and/or corporate capability briefs at that time.  Interested parties should submit a written response, on corporate letter head, to the following address: Commanding General, Marine Corps Systems Command, 2200 Lester Street, Code CTQ029/IDP, ATTN: Ira D. Patterson, Quantico, VA 22134-5060 or via email at ira.patterson@usmc.mil, no later than 21 May 2007.

<DESC>The Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Washington, DC is seeking eligible small business firms capable of performing design-build services for the full building renovation and modernization of Building W200 at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC including programming, design, base building renovations, and fit out of tenant spaces. The existing building consists of 21,461 gross square meters.  The total area for this facility at the conclusion of renovations will provide 25,983 gross square meters. 

The scope of the project entails: (1) total renovation of W200 to accommodate spaces for SSP & NIPO, and other designated Navy tenants (NCIS, OJAG, and others as space permits); (2) bringing facility into compliance with current codes and standards (eg, life safety, ADA/handicap accessibility, ATFP, energy efficiency, etc); (3) relocation of SSP and NIPO from their temporary leased spaces to W200; (4) relocation of some existing W200 tenants to new permanent locations; and (5) provision of swing space for some existing W200 tenants (OJAG, NCIS) who will ultimately remain in W200 after the renovation.. 

It is the responsibility of the successful design builder to review, validate, and reconcile all tenant program information so that a final approved program will fit within the target gross square meters;  the design builder will (after contract award) meet with all tenants and review program information. Tenants include those designated to (1) move into Bldg W200 and (2) move out of Bldg W200, and (3) remain in Building W200.  The successful design build contractor will be responsible for validating the information with the existing tenants and proposed tenants and to develop a final space program, including all furniture and equipment needs of those tenants.  Full interior design services are required, including furniture and equipment layout, procurement, and installation.

In general, the types of spaces required by tenants include admin spaces, open and closed office environments, conference spaces, computer spaces, teaching spaces, SCIF spaces, storage spaces, support spaces, and Naval Exchange/Food.  Work also involves exterior site work, utility connections, and hazardous material handling and abatement.  W200 exterior and interior renovation shall include the total removal of all existing mechanical, electrical, communications, plumbing, fire protection systems and walls, windows and all architectural finishes, unless noted otherwise.

The design builder will develop phasing strategies that will require certain tenants to swing into temporary space (outside W200) and then return, and will allow certain spaces and functions to remain operational during construction with as little disturbance as possible during construction activities. 

Project construction costs will total in the range of $55 - $65 million.  All service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, certified HUBZone small businesses, and certified 8(a) small disadvantaged businesses are encouraged to respond.

Also, there is no adequate method for quantitative and qualitative monitoring of airborne CNT due to their complexity. 

In a current research project grant-supported by NIOSH under Grant number G5B10095 (Judy Q. Xiong, PI), a comprehensive, yet practical method for quantification and characterization of airborne CNT samples using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and automated image analysis software is being developed. 

Under the NIOSH grant the NYU Medical Center contractor will prepare samples of bulk and airborne CNT, and analyze same by AFM. Under this contract, contractor will prepare and analyze further samples and share them with NIOSH researchers for  Raman and Photoluminescence Spectroscopic analysis.  Contractor will, in addition, share the AFM results with NIOSH personnel and collaborate in the interpretation of AFM and Raman and Photoluminescence results.  


Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their capabilities statement and supporting information in the format they choose, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please forward capabilities and supporting information to: Rebecca Mullenax, Reference 000HCCCD-2007-42949, DHHS/PHS/CDC/NIOSH, 1095 Willowdale Road, Morgantown, WV 26505, or E-mail rmullenax@cdc.gov  or fax to 304-285-6083.   


The government will review any/all capabilities statements and supporting information submitted and determine if other qualified sources do exist that could provide the requirement.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All vendors must be registered in the Central Contractor Registry (CCR) prior to award of a federal contract. Vendors may register at www.ccr.gov.

<DESC>United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), 820 Chandler Street, Fort Detrick, MD  21702-5014; Attention: Barry Sayer, Contracting Officer Description The United States Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), on behalf of the Tricare Management Activity, is seeking information for the purpose of obtaining market research only.  This is NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION; but rather, a request for  information (RFI) from industry that will allow the Government to identify interested sources capable of meeting the described requirement, and develop an acquisition strategy.  The information sought herein is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a request for quote (RFQ), request for proposal (RFP), invitation for bid (IFB), or as an obligation or commitment on the part of the Government to acquire any product or service. NO PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED OR ACCEPTED UNDER THIS SYNOPSI S OR UNDER THIS SOLICITATION NUMBER.  No reimbursement will be made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this synopsis or any follow-up information requests.  Responses to this notice are not offers; will not be accepted by th e Government to form a binding contract; and will not be returned.  All information that is marked proprietary and received in response to this RFI, will be handled accordingly.  This Notice shall not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue  a solicitation or ultimately award a contract.  Should a requirement arise, the full description will be detailed in the resulting solicitation.  Questions concerning the requirements for a future solicitation will not be entertained. This is a request for information (RFI) from the Tri-Service Infrastructure Management Program Office (TIMPO).  TIMPO is seeking detailed information regarding the interest and ability of public and private firms to provide:  1) computer systems hosting se rvices; 2) systems support and administration; 3) outside infrastructure support, to include long haul infrastructure support services; and 4) daily sustainment of major transactional Department of Defense (DoD) enterprise-wide clinical systems.  These sys tems form the DoD Electronic Health Record (EHR), supporting the care provided to the 9.2 million beneficiaries of the Military Health System (MHS) TRICARE Program.  Currently in worldwide deployment, these systems provide real-time access to individual an d population healthcare information by authorized personnel worldwide.  They also establish the means to gather health care data and assess the medical and dental history and status of individuals as well as the entire MHS population through an enterprise decision support system.  These enterprise-wide clinical systems, implemented at over 890 Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) worldwide, are open architecture, multi-tiered systems based on a client/server model.  To date, these systems have processed app roximately 19 million outpatient encounters with close to 1.7 million inpatient clinical encounters per workweek.  The systems are engineered to have 99.5% end-to-end availability minimally, and are enabled by a high-availability, high quality of service W ide Area Network. For several years the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has been utilized as a system hosting provider for the MHS, currently hosting well over 15 of our most critical clinical and resource applications. As the DoD, and more importantly the MHS, pu t more emphasis on web based or web enabled applications we foresee our hosting requirements increasing and so we are faced with the very real issue of cost versus business continuity. In an effort to determine the best way forward the MHS is in the proces s of developing a business case analysis (BCA) designed to explore the potential benefits and challenges of hosting outside of a DISA hosting facility from both a fiscal concern as well as a business/functional/operational co ncern.  TIMPO requests this information from vendors to aid in the development of a business case analysis (BCA) for evaluation of viable hosting service alternatives.  Information provided should include your companys experience relative to the outlined requirem ents and any additional capabilities you would suggest.  The new location will be within the continental United States (CONUS), and physically located on a military installation.  Additionally, an Alternate Computing Facility (ACF) is required.  The ACF wi ll mirror the physical setup of the primary facility.  The ACF will be at a minimum, 800  1000 miles away from the primary facility, capable of remote operation, and provide high-speed replication of data between the primary and alternate site.  The ACF w ill receive updates from the Primary Computing Facility (PCF) in real time increments.  Management of the 101 local cache servers (LCS) housed at local MTFs worldwide is a secondary requirement for the MHS.  Respondents should address their ability to prov ide database management, care and feeding, and troubleshooting/monitoring of the LCS at MTFs worldwide.  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS RESPONSES ARE DUE BY:   Responses shall not exceed 50 pages when printed and should be transmitted with attachments in Microsoft Word or pdf format.  Maximum allowed electronic file size is 10 megabytes. Multiple emails authorized. Capability Packages must include the following: (1)	A brief high-level description of their organization. (2)	Capability Statement demonstrating knowledge and ability to perform services. (3)	Relevant Past Performance information  demonstrating ability to provide ALL capabilities noted (3)	A description of FTE seniority and necessary skill sets, as they correspond to the above 	mandatory performance and associated hardware requirements.

<SUBJECT>99 -- This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.
<DESC>This notice DOES NOT constitute a request for information, quote, or proposal for procurement of products or services.

This notice concerns an action which may affect your company's continued business with the Federal Government and should not be disregarded.  It is in your best interest to respond to this notice.

The Committee for Purchase From People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled is an independent agency of the Federal Government.  The Committee, under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, provides employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Those products which are required to be purchased by the Federal Government under the AbilityOne (formerly JWOD) Program are added to the Committee's Procurement List (P/L).  You can view the P/L on our website at www.jwod.gov.  Once a product is added to the P/L to be performed by a nonprofit agency, it is no longer available to be provided by commercial firms.

The Committee has been asked to consider adding the following product to the P/L:
Ballpoint Pen, Stick, NSNs: 7520-00-NIB-1793; 7520-00-NIB-1794; 7520-00-NIB-1795; 7520-00-NIB-1796; 7520-00-NIB-1797; 7520-00-NIB-1798.  The contracting agency involved is the General Services Administration, Region 2, New York, NY. 
   

Before adding a product to the P/L, the Committee considers the potential impact that removal from commercial channels of this product, as well as similar products, would have on the sales of the firms that are currently providing Ballpoint Pen, Stick to GSA and the extent to which the potentially affected suppliers are dependent on the income.  Similar products are the Stick Pen, Medium Point, Red Ink (PAP-332-11), Grip Ballpoint Pen, Medium Point, Black Ink (PAP-88079) and Stick Pen, Antimicrobial, Black Ink (PMF-05097).

In order for the Committee to be able to assess the potential impact on affected companies, it is important that these firms report the following information to the Committee:  

1) Total Revenues accrued from all sources for the most recent 12-month time period

2) Revenues accrued by providing dry erase starter kits to GSA for the same most recent 12-month period 

3) The length of time the potentially affected firm has been providing these products to GSA.  

The information prescribed above must reach the Committee no later than May 23, 2007 and can be submitted in letter format.  If information is not received by the date requested, the Committee could conclude that potentially affected firms have determined that there will be no severe adverse impact should the listed product be added to the P/L.

It is only with this information that the Committee can perform an accurate impact analysis.  Your letter can be returned either by mail to the address on this notice or by fax to
(703) 603-0030.  You may also provide any other information you deem appropriate.  If any of the information you provide is proprietary, please advise us in your reply, and we will ensure that it is safeguarded from disclosure.

When assessing impact on a commercial firm, the Committee takes into account the revenues of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well. If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, please identify the other corporations to which the company is related, the nature of the relationship, and the other corporations total revenue data.

General information concerning the Committee and its authority can be found in Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c, or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  Both of these references can be found on the Committee's website at www.jwod.gov.  If you have specific questions or require further explanation concerning this letter or the addition of the above-referenced product to the P/L, please contact Ms. Connie Mehr at (703) 603-2116.

<OFFADD>Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Acquisition and Grants Office, SSMC4 - Room 7601/OFA61 1305 East West Highway, 7th Floor, Silver Spring, MD, 20910, UNITED STATES
<SUBJECT>A -- GOES-R Ground Segment: Market Research and Release of Draft Documents for Anticipated Procurement
<DESC>This requirement is in the market research phase and the Government is not only seeking sources for this proposed acquisition but alternatives to the approach reflected in the referenced documents.

A.  Background

On March 21, 2007 NOAA posted a pre-solicitation notice (reference number: NE-EK000-5-00033) that identified a revised GOES-R acquisition approach for the procurement of space and ground systems for the GOES-R satellite.  This notice explained how NOAA awarded contracts for the Preliminary Design and Risk Reduction (PDRR) phase of GOES-R to three contractor teams in anticipation of a single contract for the spacecraft, ground system, and system integration.  However, the Government has determined that the spacecraft and ground system will be procured separately.  The PDRR contracts ended April 20, 2007, and NOAA and NASA are now proceeding with their separate procurements.  NOAA will retain overall program management responsibility, acquire the ground system, operate the system following satellite launch, and will be responsible for algorithm development.  NASA will award the spacecraft contract, continue to award the instrument contracts, and acquire the launch vehicle under a separate contract.  The GOES-R Program office will manage overall systems engineering and integration.

B.	Pre-solicitation Information for Potential Offerors:

1.  This is a solicitation for Government market research and offeror planning purposes.  The objective during this phase is to invite potential prime offerors/offeror teams to submit information and request a one-on-one discussion that allows the Government to assess the market for viable competitors.  The Government is seeking sources for the proposed acquisition, and is soliciting top level feedback and alternatives to the procurement approach reflected in the GOES-R Ground Segment related documents.  NOAA is conducting this activity to promote competition, improve the Governments knowledge of industrys capabilities, and improve potential offerors understanding of NOAAs requirements.  The Government is also soliciting information from the small business community.  Small, small disadvantaged, women-owned, veteran-owned, and HUBZone businesses are invited to submit relevant information for the purposes of determining the appropriate level of competition and small business subcontracting goals for this requirement.  

2.  NOAA has posted three related documents on the NOAA GOES-R Program Office Web site at http://osd.goes.noaa.gov/ac.php to assist potential offerors understanding of preliminary Ground Segment (GS) objectives and requirements.  The documents are the GOES-R GS Acquisition and Operations (A&O) Procurement Concept, the GOES-R GS Functional and Performance Specifications (F&PS), and the GOES-R GS Concept of Operations (CONOPS).  The Procurement Concept document provides information on the GOES-R Program background, GS objectives, the system integration concept, a GS effectivity concept with high level milestones, contracting method and management information requirements, planned Government furnished property items, and the anticipated GS procurement schedule.      

3.  This preliminary information is being made available for planning purposes only, subject to FAR Clause 52.215-3, entitled Solicitation for Information or Planning Purposes.  It does not constitute a Request for Proposal, Invitation for Bid, or Request for Quotation, and it is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to enter into a contract.  The GOES-R GS procurement is subject to review or cancellation at any time.

4.  The preliminary documents described in this notice constitute all information concerning the procurement of the GOES-R GS that will be furnished at this time.  Firms interested in obtaining a hardcopy of this synopsis and preliminary documents described herein must submit a request, in writing, to David Runner, Contracting Officer, NASA/GSFC, GOES-R Code 417, Bldg 6, Room S104, Greenbelt, MD, 20771 

C.  Government Requested Information from Potential Prime Offerors

1.   NOAA invites potential prime offerors to submit the information described below:
a.	Expression of Interest and Prospective Team 
b.	Capability Information
c.	Relevant Past Performance
d.	General feedback on GS objectives, schedules, and requirements

2.   The expression of interest information should identify the prime contractors prospective team members.  This list should include any major interdivisional participation and first tier subcontractors, and should show the general division of work planned for each team member.

3.  Capability information should include a discussion of the potential offerors understanding of the GOES-R GS requirements, the key technologies that can be applied to GOES-R, lifetime requirements in driving design considerations, lessons learned in past ground systems development that can be applied to GOES-R, and any preliminary design and risk reduction activities that are relevant to GOES-R.  This section should also include a brief description of the potential offerors facilities, financial condition and other resources necessary for developing, producing, integrating, and testing the GOES-R GS.  Include the availability of facilities and other resources.      

4.  Relevant past performance information should include a discussion of the potential offerors past experience in developing and supporting the operations of ground systems for  systems similar in nature to GOES.  The past performance information should include a listing of contracts/subcontracts, and a brief description of the quality of performance on these contracts, the relevance of the experience, and any other past performance history that demonstrates an ability to successfully perform the GOES-R GS contract.

5.  General feedback from potential offerors should include the identification of significant technical and schedule risks, and specific comments on any aspect of the Governments preliminary GS Procurement Concept, GS F&PS, and GS CONOPS.  Prime offeror teams are also encouraged to provide comments on alternative approaches to the Governments requirements.

6.  NOAA has requested this information to allow the Government to perform an informal review of potential prime offerors possible viability as competitors for the prime GS contract.  NOAA may ask for supplemental information.  Potential prime offerors that submit responsive information will be notified by email that NOAA has received the information.  NOAA does not intend to formally advise each submitter of their potential to be a viable competitor for the prime GS contract; however, NOAA may do so informally.  Notwithstanding the advice provided by the Government in response to their submission, submitters may participate in any resultant GS acquisition. 

7.  Potential prime offerors interested in submitting proposals for the prime GS contract and/or those who intend to respond with information to this synopsis are requested to contact David Runner within three days of receiving this notice.  All requested information and comments on the preliminary documents are due by 5:00 PM EDT, May 31, 2007, to the address cited in paragraph B.4. above; email responses will also be accepted at david.t.runner@noaa.gov and mary.petruzzo@noaa.gov.  Information submittals are limited to 15 pages, cover to cover.  Use 8.5 inches x 11 inches white paper, 10 point font, single sided print, and no foldouts or elaborate graphics.  NOAA will only accept information and comment packages from potential prime offerors; prospective subcontractors should not submit separate packages.  Small business firms should follow instructions in paragraph D of this announcement.

	8.  NOAA invites potential prime offerors and their team mates to participate in one-on-one discussions with the GOES-R GS Project Office and NOAA procurement personnel.  This discussion period is open starting May 16, 2007, and will continue until June 8, 2007.  Discussions are limited to a two hour period per team, and will be held at NOAA headquarters facilities in Silver Spring, Maryland.  Potential prime offeror team participation is limited to 10 people.  Potential prime offerors are requested to contact David Runner to schedule a discussion with NOAA.

	9.  The GOES-R Ground Project intends to release a draft request for proposal (RFP) for ground segment effort in the June to July 2007 time frame.  It is the responsibility of potential prime offerors to monitor FedBizOpps for further NOAA acquisition announcements.

10. This announcement is for information purposes only; it is not a solicitation.  Any information or documents submitted by vendors will be used for market research purposes only.  Additional details regarding the GOES-R GS acquisition will be provided subsequently. 

D.  Government Requested Information from Small Business/Small Disadvantaged Business/Women and/or Veteran Owned Businesses/HUBZone Businesses

Businesses under this category who wish to provide information should submit data similar to that required for the potential prime offerors.  Responses should not exceed 8 pages.  This information will be used to assess an appropriate level of competition and the level of subcontracting goals for the prime contract.  Please note, however, that the Government does not intend to perform any viability assessment or notify the business entity as to their viability to participate in this requirement.  Please send all small business responses directly to the NOAA Small Business Representative, Lawrence Frazier, by email at lawrence.b.frazier@noaa.gov.  Mr. Frazier may be contacted by telephone at (301) 713-4179.

<DESC>Personal Cooling System RFI Product Manager- Soldier Survivability (PM-SSV) is seeking information regarding the availability of Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) and Government-off-the-Shelf (GOTS) Personal Cooling Systems (PCS).  This notice constitutes a Request for Information only , THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION, no award will be made for this effort at this time.  BACKGROUND: PM-SSV is conducting a market survey to determine the availability of COTS, modified commercial products or GOTS that can provide a level of protection for Soldiers against heat injuries/dangers due to exposure to extreme heat environments/cond itions.  After review and evaluation of industry's submissions, samples of the most promising candidates may be procured for the Soldier Protection Demonstration (field testing) to evaluate the efficacy of the products and determine suitability for Army us e.  DESCRIPTION: The Army seeks PCS that meet the requirements outlined. PCS requirements are expressed as Threshold (i.e. minimum) and Objective (i.e. desired) requirements, where applicable.  If a parameter has only one value, it is the threshold requirement .  PCSs will be used with clothing and individual equipment (CIE), and/or Interceptor Body Armor (IBA) worn and carried by Soldiers, excluding chemical protective clothing and equipment. (1)  Weight.  8 pounds (Threshold-T); 5 pounds (Objective - O).  Weight includes the cooling system, power source (if applicable), and cooling garment. (2)  Cooling.  120 watts (T), 180 watts (O) average heat removal at a 95F ambient environment, as measured in accordance with F2371-05 Standard Test Method for Measuring the Heat Removal Rate of Personal Cooling Systems Using a Sweating Heated Manikin. (3)  Duration.  2 hours (T); 4 hours (O).  Duration is defined as the point at which the net cooling level provided by the PCS drops to less than 50 watts, as measured in accordance with the test method cited in 2.2 above. (4)  Size.  150 in3 (T); 120 in3 (O).  This includes the cooling unit and power source, but not the cooling garment.  The thickness of the cooling garment must not exceed 0.375 inch (T); 0.25 inch (O). (5)  Logistics.  Logistics shall consist of the replacement of the power source (e.g. batteries), dust filters, etc.  Systems requiring water, refrigerators/freezers and/or air conditioned spaces to recharge or replenish the cooling medium cannot be suppor ted and, therefore, products requiring this logistics tail will not be considered. (6) Orientation.  The PCS must operate at its threshold performance level at orientation changes of up to 15 degrees from vertical (T); orientation insensitive (O).   (7)  Compatibility with CIE or IBA. a.  No specification shall be made to legacy CIE to facilitate integration of the PCS. b.  The integration of the PCS shall not require the resizing of legacy CIE or IBA. c.  The PCS must include all hardware to mount it securely on the body.  It shall not interfere with other items typically carried/worn by Soldiers (e.g., helmet, body armor). d.  Wearing the PCS shall not compromise the protection provided by legacy CIE. e.  The PCS shall not require a tether to an auxiliary device (e.g. power generator) during operation and dismount operation. (8)  Power.  If needed, the PCS power source must operate on standard military or commonly available COTS batteries (T); standard military and commonly available COTS batteries (O).  (9)  Operations. a.  Controls.  The PCS shall have provisions to allow users to turn the system on or off (T); high, low, off or skin temperature feedback (O). b.  The PCS controls must be easily accessible and distinguishable when operated with a gloved hand and in low light, but have sufficient safeguards to avoid inadvertent activation during execution of Individual Movement Techniques (IMTs). c.  The PCS shall be capable of being donned/doffed without assistance.  The PCS must have a quick release mechanism that allows the  user to doff the system in less than 30 seconds, without compromising the protection provided by the CIE. (10)  Environmental.  The PCS will be evaluated in a simulated operational environment; therefore, it must be capable of withstanding associated environmental insults such as sand/dust, rain, vibration, and mechanical shock. (11)  Support Equipment.  PCS support equipment must be minimized.  Any support equipment must be provided with the PCS. (12)  Tools.  The PCS shall not introduce/require any special tools to operate or maintain the system. (13)  Reliability.  The PCS must be capable of operating for 200 hours (T), 500 hours (O) before system failure (note: periodic maintenance, described in 2.14 may be performed). (14)  Safety/Health Hazards. a.  Health hazards associated with the PCS will be eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels. b.  The PCS will be constructed of materials that are non-toxic when in contact with the skin and open wounds.  If components are burned, fumes will be no more toxic than legacy electronic or CIE currently worn/carried/used by Soldiers, if inhaled.  The PC S will neither contain nor produce hazardous waste more than legacy electronic or clothing equipment of similar construction. c.  The PCS design must not present a safety hazard to personnel; sharp edges or corners must be eliminated and sufficient safeguards on moving parts must be included to prevent bodily injury or damage to other CIE. d.  During operation, the PCS shall not present a contact burn hazard to users. (15)  Maintenance.  There shall be no maintenance required of the PCS during its operation.  Maintenance should be restricted to pre/post-operation system checkout. At this time, PM-SSV is seeking sources, technical and product information for PCS. This market survey is for informational purposes only; this is not a Request for Proposal (RFP).

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This procurement is being conducted under Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.5   This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through the November 2006 Federal Acquisition Regulation revision, which includes the consolidation of all Federal Acquisition Circulars through 2005-16.  This acquisition is a small business set-aside and the NAICS code is 541611. The Office of Research Services (ORS) and the Office of Research Facilities (ORF) have been engaged in a multi-year effort to improve the delivery of its services to the NIH community. This large-scale organizational change effort is known as Performance Management (PM) started in FY02, and it builds on the foundation laid by the Annual Self Assessments (ASAs) conducted during FY01. The Office of Quality Management (OQM) has customized the Balanced Scorecard approach to develop strategic planning and performance measurements. 
Regardless of the ORS/ORF service delivery group, there are several general organizational change goals both organizations strive to achieve with PM:
Goal 1: Improve customer service to NIH customers
Goal 2: Modify its service options and the service portfolio to keep pace with
changing customer needs
Goal 3: Study and improve processes to increase operational efficiency 
Goal 4: Reduce costs of services to customers, where possible, while maintaining quality 
Goal 5: Invest in the Quality of Work Life for all employees 
Goal 6: Analyze changes in the unit cost of products/services to understand why changes occur
Purpose
The purpose of this effort is to provide technical consultation services to participants of the PM implementation, including the OQM, the (PM) Teams themselves, and senior ORS/ORF leadership
Scope of Task
The contractor will provide technical consultation to performance measurement participants in the ORS. The contractor will apply the balanced scorecard approach, including data collection and analysis efforts to a group of diverse service providers in ORS/ORF. The contractor will need to become familiar with the specifics of portfolio of services delivered by ORS/ORF to be an effective PM consultant. The contractor will develop and provide training to educate the workforce on performance management approaches. The contractor will work closely with OQM to deliver a consistent message regarding the PM approach, process, and deliverables. 
The contractor will work with a number of PM Team Leaders and Team Members to formulate and implement Performance Management Plans (PMPs). The contractor will be responsible for coordinating with PM Team Leaders to schedule meetings, facilitating meetings, providing technical advice to PM Team Leaders and Members during meetings and on an individual basis as recommended by the Team Leader. For new teams, the focus will be on developing their value propositions, strategy statements, performance objectives, performance measures, data collection plans, and methods to analyze and interpret data.

The contractor will work with teams to collect and analyze data, but will typically not be personally involved in data collection activities except on a case-by-case basis. The contractor will assist teams in interpreting their data using basic graphical approaches, and when appropriate, using more advanced techniques such as process behavior charts and statistical analyses. The contractor will assist teams in interpreting performance measurement data to increase understanding of customers, processes, resources, and costs. The contractor will facilitate the formulation of ideas for action based on data focused on enhancing service delivery.
The contractor will need to manage the consulting relationship with the PM Teams to ensure that he/she is not doing the work for the Teams, but providing advice and technical assistance in the Team's efforts to implement PM.
The contractor will be responsible developing customer scorecards, as requested.  This includes developing survey instruments, gathering the data, analyzing the data and generating a report on the findings of each survey conducted.
The contractor may be asked to provide technical consultation to senior ORS leadership to encourage ownership and buy-in of PM. This consultation could involve education sessions, assistance in leading Program Area quarterly review meetings, and facilitating discussions regarding PM at the organization-wide level.
The contractor will also be expected to share ideas for improvement in the PM process with OQM, and to suggest specific tools and methods that will increase the likelihood of the implementation of performance management and organizational change. While providing ideas on the PM process, the contractor must recognize that the final decisions regarding methodology for implementation of the PM will be made by OQM.

1.	 adapting the Balanced Scorecard to federal government agencies;
2.	 providing technical consultation to Federal government service providers in performance management;
3.	Developing customer satisfaction surveys tailored to specific organizational needs;

The 696th ARSS plans to award a Sole Source Cost-Plus-Fixed-Fee contract with Raytheon Missile Systems Company to provide support on the AMRAAM AIM-120D.

The second is to provide the necessary technical support associated with an AIM-120D captive carry reliability program.  The third is to provide the additional/enhanced data requested by the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation.  Finally, the fourth task is to provide the necessary technical services associated with integrating the AIM-120D on to the non-SDD USAF and USN aircraft.  This effort requires access to Raytheon Company proprietary data, existing test equipment and production facilities. The period of performance is 48 months.

The following justification and approval is provided for other than full and open competition for this purchase. 

1.   Agency and Contracting Activity:  The Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP), Anniston, Alabama, proposes to enter into a contract on a basis other than full and open competition.

2.   Nature and/or Description of Action Being Approved.  The CDP requested approval to solicit competitively for brand name only, for 26 additional APD2000 Advanced Portable Chemical Agent Detectors for training support so that each instructor conducting training at remote sites will conduct training with the exact same unit as used in each Program of Instruction (POI) at the resident site. 
    
3.   Description of Supplies/Services.  This requirement is for the purchase of  twenty-six (26) APD2000 Advanced Portable Chemical Agent Detectors.

4.  Identification of Statutory Authority Permitting Other than Full and Open Competition.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 41 USC 253 (c) (5) as stated in FAR 6.302-1, entitled "nly One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements".

5.  Demonstration that the Nature of the Acquisition Require Use of the Authority Cited.  
The current training POI for Technical Emergency Response Training (TERT), Hands-On-Training (HOT), Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Complexities, and ER HazMat requires the incorporation of the APD2000 in the training for these courses. The training department requires 26 additional units to have sufficient equipment to support the off-site courses at remote locations.

6.  Description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable.  The requirement is posted in FedBizOpps; the single government point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities. All interested APD2000 dealers/distributors will be afforded the opportunity to participate in the acquisition.

7. Determination by the Contracting Officer that the Anticipated Cost to the Government will be Fair and Reasonable.  The Contracting Officer hereby determines that the cost to the Government for this acquisition will be fair and reasonable based upon the expectation that sufficient competition will be obtained by posting the combined synopsis/solicitation to FedBizOpps and comparison to the vendor's commercial product price list.    

8.  Description of Market Research.  Full scale market research was not conducted, however, research through query of internet sites failed to disclose any manufacturers of comparable items.

9.  Any Other Facts Supporting the Use of Other Than Full and Open Competition.  The use of the APD2000 in the training environment is essential for our emergency responders to ensure all training is conducting using the same equipment whether on-site resident training or off-site courses conducted at remote locations.

10.   A Listing of the Sources, if any, that Expressed, in Writing, an Interest in the Acquisition.  The only source considered for this procurement action is an authorized distributor/dealer for the APD2000. No other sources have expressed an interest in this acquisition.

11.  A statement of the Actions, if any, the Agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers to competition before any subsequent acquisition of supplies or services are required.  We will continue to conduct market research periodically to determine if comparable sources/products are available.

<DESC>The project focus is for the full building renovation and modernization of Building W200 at the Washington Navy Yard, Washington, DC including programming, space layout, design, building renovations, and fit out of tenant spaces. The existing building consists of approximately 21,400 gross square meters.  The total area for this facility at the conclusion of renovations will provide slightly less than 26,000 gross square meters. 

The scope of the project entails: (1) total renovation of W200 to accommodate spaces several Navy tenants; (2) bringing facility into compliance with current codes and standards (eg, life safety, ADA/handicap accessibility, energy efficiency, anti-terrorism/force protection (ATFP) per UFC  4-010-01, ?DoD Minimum Antiterrorism Force Standards for Buildings?, etc); (3) relocation of  some tenants from their temporary leased spaces to Bldg W200; and (4) provision of temporary swing space (outside of Bldg W200) for some existing W200 tenants who will ultimately remain in W200 after the renovation. Work also involves exterior site work, utility connections, and hazardous material handling and abatement.  W200 exterior and interior renovation shall include the total removal of all existing mechanical, electrical, communications, plumbing, fire protection systems and walls, windows and all architectural finishes, unless noted otherwise.

It is the responsibility of the successful design builder to reconcile all tenant program information so that a final approved program will fit within the target gross square meters;  the design builder will (after contract award) review program information and develop floor plans that optimally accommodate tenant requirements.  The successful design build contractor will be responsible for analyzing RFP requirements, with respect to final tenants and functions that will occupy W200; and develop a final space program, including all furniture and equipment needs of those tenants.  Full interior design services are required, including furniture and equipment layout, and possibly procurement, and installation.

In general, the types of spaces required by tenants include admin spaces, open and closed office environments, conference spaces, computer spaces, teaching spaces, SCIF spaces, storage spaces, support spaces, museum spaces, and Naval Exchange/Food.  

W200 is presently occupied. Contractor responsibility will include moving tenants: (1) from existing locations to Building W200; (2) from Building W200 to long term and short term locations; and (3) from short term locations back to Building W200.

Most present building tenants will be re-located to other spaces outside of W200, prior to the start of W200 ?interior building? construction. There will be one tenant who will occupy the facility during most of the construction. There will be other tenants who will be occupying W200 at the time of W200 contract award but be out of the facility prior to start of the construction phase.  There will be some existing W200 spaces and functions (eg, base telecommunications room) that will remain operational during construction, with as little disturbance as possible during construction activities. The Contractor will develop phasing strategies to accommodate the tenants and functions mentioned in the previous paragraphs. 

The design build contractor will also be responsible for providing approximately 240 additional parking spaces at the Washington Navy Yard via provision of  (approximately)  7300 Square Meter deck addition to an existing garage, plus other minor surface parking; (existing parking garage to remain operational during construction).

This procurement is unrestricted for a Design-Build Project being acquired through the use of the two-phase selection process.  This acquisition will result in a FIRM FIXED PRICE contract acquired through competitive negotiation procedures.  The procurement will be conducted using source selection procedure and the award will be based on best value to the government considering the price and non-priced factors.

PAST PERFORMANCE ? PHASE I

Past Performance information is one indicator of an Offeror?s ability to successfully perform this contract.  This evaluation will include the performance history of both the construction entity and the design entity.  The assessment of the Offeror?s past performance will be used as a means of evaluating the relative capability of the offeror and establish a level of risk (high, moderate, or low) for successful performance under this contract.  Past Performance findings will influence the standing of the Offeror.  Findings will be used to validate proposals against established criteria.  Offerors may be given an opportunity to address unfavorable reports of past performance.

Evaluation of Past Performance will be a subjective assessment.  The Government is seeking to determine whether the offeror has consistently demonstrated a commitment to customer satisfaction, timely delivery of services, adherence to contract schedules, subcontractor management, safety management, quality control programs, good workmanship, conformance to specifications, and fair and reasonable prices. 
 
Offerors are responsible for ensuring the completed questionnaires are submitted, by their references, via electronic submission to Robert Rounay at robert.rounay@navy.mil and Cyndi Crowder at cyndi.crowder@navy.mil.  The questionnaires shall be returned at least one (1) week prior to the proposal due date, but absolutely no later than the proposal due date and time.

Since the Government will contact the individuals identified in Factor 1 and Factor 2, it is critical that these individuals be familiar with the project to answer specific questions regarding your performance.  The Government may choose to contact additional customer(s) not provided by an offeror and may obtain additional information through other sources, such as the Past Performance Retrieval System (PPIRS), and phone interviews.   In addition to references provided under Factor 1 and Factor 2, you may include additional references that are knowledgeable of your firm?s performance.  In evaluating past performance, the Government will focus on information derived from the projects that are most relevant to this project.

<SOLNBR>W31P4Q-T-07-9579
<RESPDATE>062807
<ARCHDATE>08272007

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals  are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.   The US Army, Redstone, Arsenal, AL, is seeking domestic sources of information on technology that can be applied in the engineering, design, and continual development and evaluation of f uzes for various missile and munition applications.  To prevent inadvertent or premature weapon initiation, these fuzes include components that prevent arming until certain criteria have been met.  In addition to other physical phenomena, fuzes often use t he acceleration associated with the launch and flight of a weapon to make a decision to arm the weapon.  A centrifuge allows the acceleration-sensing parts of the fuze to be tested in a controlled, laboratory environment, by simulating those launch and fli ght accelerations.   For the purposes of testing fuzes or other test articles as desired, such a centrifuge should have at least the following characteristics: 1.	It should accommodate different fuzes by means of an adapter plate using a standard bolt pattern. 2.	It should accommodate test articles with maximum dimensions of 17 x 17 x 17 centimeters. 3.	It should accommodate test articles with maximum mass of 2.5 kilograms (approximately 5.5 pounds). 4.	It should provide for automatic load balancing by adjusting of the position of a counterweight. 5.	The test fixture and all rotating parts should be completely enclosed, with the enclosure adequate to contain all fragments from a worst-case mishap where the fuze under test either breaks apart or the explosive materials in the fuze detonate (assume 10 .0 grams net explosive mass, TNT equivalent). 6.	The centrifuge should provide for closed-loop control of acceleration at the center of mass of the test article ranging from zero to 260 revolutions per minute (rpm) in increments of one rpm with an accuracy of plus or minus 0.5 rpm.  Higher maximum spi n ratings would be of interest. 7.	Controls for the centrifuge settings must accommodate remote operation via a standard electrical interface (for example, EIA-RS-232, EIA-RS-422, EIA-RS-485, IEEE 802.3-Ethernet, IEEE-488-GPIB).  As a minimum, the centrifuge controls should indicate cent rifuge spin rate in revolutions per second (rps).  All local control readouts should be readable in daylight light intensity levels. 8.	The centrifuge should meet all requirements while operating in ambient temperatures from 55 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit, and after storage in temperatures from 20 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, with relative humidity levels ranging from 20 to 95 percent. 9.	The centrifuge should be powered from standard three-prong, 120 Vac, sixty-hertz, single-phase electrical outlet and should include built-in power conditioning and filtering, fail-safe circuit breaker protection (designed to trip when more than 15 amper es, root mean square, is drawn), and provisions for physical lockout/tagout procedures for maintenance/repair safety.  A centrifuge requiring a higher voltage, but standard, single-phase circuit (e.g., 240 Vac) would be considered. 10.	Maximum diameter of the centrifuge should be approximately 1.5 meters ( 5 feet) assuming roughly circular shape when viewed from above, with maximum height being roughly comparable, or less. 11.	Access to the test fixture and rotating parts while the centrifuge is spinning should be prevented by the incorporation of hardware-based interlocks, the opening of which should result in immediate but graceful braking of the test fixture and rotating parts to a complete stop in less than one second.  Options for braking (fast braking, slow braking, or no braking) may be useful.  Similar provisions shall be included to automatically bring the centrifuge to safe condition in the event of facility electrical power outage or undervoltage condition.  A panic button on the front of the centrifuge should provide a similar emergency shutdown function.  The panic button should have appropriate mechanical guard on it to keep it from being i nadvertently actuated during normal loading; unloading; inspection operations, but should not preclude its immediate actuation when needed. 12.	The centrifuge should provide automatic indication of, unbalanced, conditions that would lead to excessive wear of the rotating or drive elements or that would cause a safety hazard to the operator.  ,Severe, unbalanced conditions should result in auto matic graceful braking of the centrifuge to a complete stop. 13.	The centrifuge should include a safety plug or key that the operator would remove from the control panel during loading, unloading, and inspection operations.  The centrifuge drive circuits should be incapable of being energized while plug or key is ou t of the control panel.   14.	The centrifuge controls should include a power-up reset and power-on self-test (POST) capability as well as a calibration routine using a standard test mass. 15.	As an option for consideration, the centrifuge should allow for installation of a ,spinner, mechanism onto the test fixture, the purpose of which is to simulate the rolling motion of a missile, rocket, or projectile in flight.  The spinner should spin the test article clockwise or counterclockwise, as desired, about the axis intersecting the center of rotation of the centrifuge.  Spin rate should be controlled in increments of 0.1 revolutions per second (rps) over a range of zero to fifteen rps for cloc kwise or counterclockwise direction, as desired.  The use of the spinner will be restricted to small, less massive test articles with maximum dimensions of 8 x 8 x 8 centimeters and maximum mass of 0.7 kilograms (approximately 1.5 lbs).  Operation of the s pinner should be independent of the centrifuge.  Safety interlocks described earlier would also apply to the spinner. 16.	It is a desirable objective that the centrifuge and the spinner be controlled with either pre-set or event-driven profiles via standard computer interface for higher fidelity to launch and flight environments.  Compatibility with National Instruments L abVIEW version 8 or later is preferred. 17.	The centrifuge should provide for slip-ring or other mechanism to provide reliable electrical connections between the fuze under test and external instrumentation.  A minimum of sixteen connections is desired, with the internal cabling of each connecti on being shielded, and with an option to connect the shield to the fuze under test.  All connectors should be of standard type commonly used in electrical instrumentation (for example, BNC, banana jack, or terminal strip) and should not require special too ls or fasteners to use.  Each connection should be electrically isolated from the other. 18.	It is a desirable objective that the centrifuge include a camera and associated lighting that would provide for local and/or remote viewing of the inside of the centrifuge.  If the camera cannot be emplaced on the rotating arm of the centrifuge, a stro boscopic system could be used to present the operator with a ,stationary, view of the fuze under test.  Other suitable methods for visually monitoring the article under test, including the ability to record onto standard video tape or standard digital medi a, would be of interest. 19.	All metallic structures in the centrifuge that the operator could come into contact with under regular use conditions should be bonded to ,earth, ground through a resistance with a minimum value of 25 kilohms, maximum value of one megohm, in accordance  with Department of the Army Pamphlet (DA PAM 385-64) to preclude electrostatic discharge hazards. 20.	The base of the centrifuge should have provisions for mounting to a flat concrete floor using standard bolts, and should include a means for leveling the centrifuge and securely locking it into leveled position, using standard, commonly available tools. 21.	The centrifuge should be constructed to allow safe cleanup and removal of debris, fragments, and dust from articles under test. 22.	The centrifuge should have provisions for the attachment of an externally driven vent system to exhaust residual vapors from the test article. 23.	The centrifuge should be constructed using industry standard, commonly available, and/or easily fabricated parts, and in a modular fashion to simplify maintenance and repair. 24.	All parts of the centrifuge that are toggled, adjusted, or otherwise actuated or moved as part of the normal operational sequence should be designed for long wear life and should degrade gracefully, with indications of need for replacement well in adva nce of failure.  As a minimum, all motor brushes should be of a standard, easily-obtained (commercial, off-the-shelf,) type and designed for ease of replacement. Centrifuge designs that do not quite meet these requirements may still be of interest if there is a potential decrease in cost or delivery time, or if there is a potential increase in reliability, safety, or performance.  Any Product Model numbers that mee t most of the requirements stated in paragraphs above are of interest and should be submitted.  Information on available, emerging, or needed technologies and how these technologies could be applied to this project should also be included.

<DESC>CHANGE RESPONSE DATE TO 30 MAY 2007.  This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format prescribed in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The Naval Special Warfare Development Group, Virginia Beach, Virginia has a potential requirement to procure the following:  Clin 0001,  3 each, Only Male German Shepherds, Belgian Malinois and Dutch Shepherds less than 70 lbs.  Dogs must be titled in KNPV, IPO, or Schutzhund.  The age of potential dogs must be between 18 and 36 months.  Pre trained dogs in explosives detection and patrol may be accepted.  Vendors must allow buyer to perform an extensive testing process prior to purchase, to include muzzle work, bite suit, dark area?s, steps, slick floors, gunfire, vehicles, etc.  The required performance and conditions under which a potential dual-purpose dog must perform are detailed below.  Attitude and behavior of all dogs:  All dogs must be generally alert, active, outgoing, curious, and confident.  They must display basic socialization and tolerance to people.  Some of the more common factors that disqualify a dog from the program are:  Over-aggressive dogs that are unable to work around people or other dogs.  Dogs that cannot be muzzled.  Dogs that is difficult to crate or uncrate.  Dogs that exhibit excessive panting that are not due to heat or exercise.  Dogs that is afraid, nervous or shy around people.  Dogs that exhibit sensitivity or fear to surroundings such as inside of building with different types of floor surfaces, stairs, or confining areas.  Dogs with low drive or dogs that do not have the desire to complete the task.  Dogs introduced to or trained to detect drugs and later trained to detect explosives or vice versa will not be considered for procurement.  Dogs that do not perform to the standards during the evaluation will not be considered for purchase.  
Medical Requirements ? In general, all dogs must be in excellent health with no acute or chronic disease or condition, which could either hamper their ability to perform, or would be excessively costly to treat.  At the time of evaluation, each animal must be medically able to ender training.  Gait.  All dogs must display normal mobility at a walk or run.  Dogs are disqualified for any gait abnormality, which could affect the dog?s ability to perform normal MWD duties.  Skin and Coat.  Skin and coat must be healthy in appearance, displaying no evidence of chronic dermatitis, allergies, infections, injuries or marked external parasite infestation (e.g., mange, flees, etc).  Teeth and Jaws.  Dogs will have normal dental occlusion, not overshot or undershot jaws.  All four canine teeth must be present and must not be weakened by notching, enamel hyperplasia or abnormal, excessive wear.  Heart and Lungs.  Heart sounds, rate and rhythm must be normal (e.g. no murmurs, arrhythmia, etc).  In general, the cardiovascular and respiratory system must be normal at rest and upon exercise.  Hip dysphasia and elbow dysphasia.  A malformation of  the hip and elbow joints, respectively, which usually results in degenerative joint disease, arthritis and chronic lameness.  Radiological evidence of hip dysphasia or elbow dysphasia, will disqualify a dog.  Nervous System and Basic Senses.  Any defect in the nervous system, to include the basic senses of vision, hearing and sense of smell, is disqualifying.  Examples include, but are not limited to, opacities of the cornea, eyelid deformities, cataracts, retinal degeneration, chronic otitis, acute or chronic rhinitis/sinusitis and spinal disease.  Heartworms.  All dogs submitted for purchase must be free of heartworms (Dirofilaria immitis).  Intestinal Parasitism.  Infection with intestinal parasites (roundworms, hookworms, tapeworms, etc) may not be disqualifying, depending on the level of infection and the overall condition of the animal.  Presence of intestinal parasites is, however, an indication of poor care and will raise concern about the dog?s general health.  External Parasitism.  Presence of fleas, ticks, lice or mange mites may not be disqualifying, depending on the amount of  infestation, the degree of associated skin disease, and the overall condition of the dog.  Presence of external parasites is, however, an indication of poor care and will raise concern about the dog?s general health.  Immunization.  All dogs presented must have been vaccinated within the previous 12 months from rabies, canine distemper, canine adenovirus (Type 2), corona virus, Para influenza, parvovirus and leptospirosis.  A vaccination certificate with individual dog identification (name, tattoo, and brand or microchip #) must be provided on all dogs.  This facilitates health certificate preparation, if the dog is to be returned to the vendor.  Reproductive and Urinary System.  Any congenital or conformational abnormality is disqualifying, if the defect requires long-term medical treatment or results in a shortened working life of the dog.  (E.g. Cryptorchidism is not disqualifying unless the retained testicle results in medical complications not treatable by simple orchidectomy.) Detection.  Dogs will be tested with the following any type of ball, pipe, and PVC.  Dogs must have extreme retrieve and hunt drive for thrown toys.  Dogs must have extreme possessiveness of such toys.  Dogs will be tested outside and inside alike.  Dogs will be tested on training boxes.  Dogs shall be neutral and be able to work around all kinds of animal distractions.  Patrol.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  Solicitation Number RFQ-0243061A is being issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  This Solicitation document and incorporated provisions are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-15.  It is the contractor?s responsibility to be familiar with applicable clauses and provisions.  This RFQ is issued under full and open competition and is restricted 100% to the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program as defined in the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code 333314 and the small business size standard is 500 employees or less.  Award will be made to one vendor.

?	Laser Illuminator PN# TRGLI1
?	Laser 35mW 835nM
?	Boresightable and Focusable
?	Illuminator Focus from 1 degree to 8 degree Beam Width
?	1.5vdc AA batter power (1)
?	Switch assembly to include: On/Momentary (pressure pad), Off

Answer:
No, the FBI would prefer to stay with the battery specified in the original RFQ.
