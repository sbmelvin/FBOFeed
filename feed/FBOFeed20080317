<ARCHDATE>05062008
<CONTACT>Kenneth Carter, (202) 267-3012
<DESC>This is the third in a series of announcements of a National Strategic Sourcing Initiative for the procurement of Security Guard Services (Nationwide, Alaska, Hawaii and Territories.) This announcement is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP) of any kind.  All interested parties are advised that the FAA will not pay for any information or for any administrative costs incurred or associated with responding to this market survey.  Failure to respond to the Market Survey/Information will not result in exclusion from any future competition.  This requirement is to furnish all labor, supervision and equipment to provide armed guard services at approximately 73 Federal Aviation Administration facilities located throughout the continental United States, and its territories, to include Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam and Alaska. The contractor minimum qualification requirements include, but are not limited to the following.  Additional qualifications requirements are identified in the attached Draft Statement of Work (SOW).   1.  Must have at least five consecutive years of satisfactory performance of providing armed guard service. 2.  Primary business must be furnishing guard services. 3.  Must currently possess or be able to obtain all required Federal, State and local licenses and permits to provide armed guard services. 4.  Must be responsible in all respects, including, but not limited to financial, technical, management, and past performance. The NAICS Code under this requirement is 561612, Security Guards and Patrol Services, with a size standard in millions of dollars of $17 million. We are conducting this market survey with three primary purposes in mind. First, to obtain information as to whether there are interested sources that can solely perform, which includes managing, a contract of this magnitude with the contractor's own work force.           Secondly, to obtain information necessary to determine specifically if there are Small Businesses who can perform a contract of this magnitude, to include Program Management, and to obtain information on the approach they would utilize in the performance of the contract, i.e. teaming, partnering, etc.   Thirdly, to obtain information necessary to determine if adequate competition exists for the guard services as contemplated in the attached SOW. The FAA contemplates including a requirement under this acquisition setting aside a percentage (between 30-35% of the dollars) of any subsequent guard services contract for socioeconomic programs.  As a result of the subcontracting possibilities, a requirement for a "Subcontracting Plan" is contemplated at the time of proposal submissions. Vendors that responded to the two previous surveys by submitting capability statements that addressed  (management capability and work force resources as well as the ability to sustain an operation of this magnitude, will still need to respond to this survey; however, only new or revised information from the list below, needs to be addressed. Vendors responding to this Survey for the first time should respond to all Items below: 1.  Capability Statement (limited to two pages) - This document should identify: ýýý	Type of security guard services provided by your firm (Armed/Unarmed). ýýý	Size and type of facilities covered by previous contracts. ýýý	Multi-State operational experiences. 2.  Expected programmatic approach (In-House, teaming, subcontracting, etc.) ýýý	Respondents must provide their strategy for accomplishing this work, including the percentage of work that will be done by eligible small 8(a) or other socio-economic businesses.  (Limit - 3 pages.) 3.  Areas currently performing with the heaviest concentration, or focus.   ýýý	Service Areas (See Attachment 2) ýýý	Regions (See Attached 3) 4.  Complete Business Declaration Form This announcement, draft statement of work and business declaration form is located at:   http://faaco.faa.gov/index.cfm Attached is a (revised) draft statement of work, dated _7 March 2008_ and business declaration form.  Respondents are encouraged to review the SOW and provide comments.  Questions or comments must be submitted to Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov by 1:00 p.m. EST, 24 March 2008.  Contracting Officer will not respond to telephonic inquiries. All responses to this market survey must be received by 1 p.m. EST, 6 April 2008.  All submittals must be submitted to: Kenneth.M.Carter@faa.gov.  Responses may be in either Microsoft Word 2003 or PDF format.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC), National Marine Mammal Laboratory (NMML), conducts research on marine mammals important to the mission of the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and NOAA, with particular attention to issues related to marine mammals off the coasts of Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California. 

The North Pacific right whale Eubalaena Japonica was severely depleted by whaling in the past two centuries.  The current size of the eastern population is estimated at fewer than 100 individuals and this stock is considered critically endangered; its current distribution is known only from records in a relatively limited area of the southeastern Bering Sea, and from a few occurrences in the Gulf of Alaska.  Historical catch and sighting data indicate that right whales were abundant and widely distributed in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska in summer and early autumn.

The NMML has a requirement for the performance of aerial surveys to determine distribution and abundance of cetaceans within the North Aleutian Basin.  The aerial surveys shall take place in the North Aleutian Basin in the Bering Sea during the months of July and August 2008 and 2009, focusing on the regions currently designated as Right Whale critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act, and proposed oil and gas sale lease areas in the Southeastern Bering Sea.  The Government will provide the survey aircraft.  Reconnaissance flights and line transect surveys will be flown to determine, through observation, the distribution and abundance of North Pacific Right Whales and other cetaceans within the North Aleutian Basin.  When encountered, Right Whales and other large cetaceans shall be photographed.  The aerial surveys will require an experienced scientific team comprised of a Project Coordinator/Principle Investigator, Field Project Leader and three Observers. The Principle Investigator must demonstrate knowledge of aerial survey methodology.  The Principle Investigator and Field Project Leader shall plan and coordinate the aerial surveys in consultation with NMML to determine the survey effort area.  Observers shall have experience photographing and identifying marine mammals from aircraft, and be familiar with computer software used to collect sightings, survey conditions, and position data.  The vendor shall compile the survey data, photographic images, and provide final field reports and raw data (including photographic images) to NMML within two months of the end of the survey for each survey period.  Deliverables will include electronic files containing all raw data including photographic images, a report summarizing all survey effort, sightings, and environmental conditions.  
 

This procurement is open to all interested parties.  All responsible sources may submit an offer which will be considered by the Agency.  For this procurement, the applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541712, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences (except Biotechnology).  Any resulting contract will be awarded as a firm-fixed price contract.  The period of performance is for one (1) base year with one (1) additional one-year option period.  Solicitation documents will be made available for download on or about April 1, 2008 at http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  Paper copies of this solicitation will not be issued.

<DESC>The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Geraldine M. Wolfle, Durham, NC 27709 pursuant to 41 U.S.C.253(c)(1)--Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  This purchase is for senior advisory services to the NIEHS Acting Director as per the following statement of work.  This contract will allow for an ongoing project currently being conducted by Ms. Wolfle to be completed by 9/30/08.It is expected that Ms. Wolfe will provide expert advice to the Acting Director and Senior Leadership on constituency development.  Specifically, she will: Provide expert advice and counsel to the Acting Director and Senior Leadership on ways to build constituency support and develop and facilitate partnerships with medical research organizations, advocacy groups, professional organizations and Federal and State agencies.  Provide advice on program development and building support for new programs.  Attend regular meetings with the Acting Director, NIEHS, to discuss and strategize on the development and implementation of new partnerships for environmental health sciences. Analyze and propose appropriate new operating procedures that would build partners and support for NIEHS.  Serve as liaison between the NIEHS Acting Director and outside organizations. Focus shall be on:  identifying areas for collaboration;  improving ongoing communication with outside partners;  attending meetings with the Acting Director (These meetings include all meetings with outside organizations, other NIH institutes and DHHS agencies.);
and developing a plan for communication with NIEHS constituencies and partners.  Deliverables:  Provide monthly reports with supporting materials organizations, institutes, agencies contacted and the products of the interactions.  These reports will be provided to the Acting Director, NIEHS, with a copy to the Project Officer.  The objective of this procurement is to provide expert advice to the Acting Director, NIEHS, and NIEHS Senior Leadership onsite at the NIEHS headquarters, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, with particular focus on the development of constituencies and Institute partners. The sole source proposed for this work is Ms. Geraldine M. Wolfle, and this sole source justification results from the fact that Ms. Wolfle?s qualifications for this particular task are unique; i.e., to the best of the Agency's knowledge, no other contractor in the world has the unique experience, skills, historical knowledge, and current knowledge of NIEHS activities as required for optimal performance of these services for the Acting Director, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and Senior Leadership for the following reasons.  The projects described in the statement of work require an extensive hands-on working knowledge of NIEHS and NIH current and past programs and resources. Of paramount importance is a historical knowledge of the NIEHS, the other NIH institutes, the NIH overall and other federal agencies missions, plans, and activities.  It also required extensive hands-on working knowledge of the medical community, specifically academic institutions, to facilitate collaboration among groups and partnership building.  Thus, in order to provide expert advice to the Acting Director, NIEHS, and Senior Leadership relative to tasks described in the Statement of work, any other contractor would first need to develop an extensive historical background, comprehensive understanding and up-to-date working knowledge of not only NIEHS, but also other NIH institutes and academic institutions. Without that knowledge, a contractor would have to rely upon staff of NIEHS, NIH, other NIH institutes and the particular academic institution to assume the extensive burden of explaining the inner workings of the Institute and bringing the contractor up to speed in advance of beginning building partnerships and giving advice on program development; and such NIEHS staff is not currently available due to a significant number of vacancies in key positions.  In addition, these projects must be completed quickly to ensure that the Acting Director's focus and resources are optimized and not interrupted. Again, only a consultant with significant past and current hands-on experience with NIEHS, NIH and academic institutions could conduct this work in the timeframe available to the Agency for its completion.  Unique Qualifications of Ms. Geraldine M. Wolfle: Ms. Wolfle has skills that are significant and difficult to duplicate including over 20 years experience in trans-NIH and trans-Agency activities as well as working with outside groups while working in the Office of the Director at both NHLBI and NIEHS. She has over 37 years of experience in government. Her experience includes participation at the senior management level of the NIEHS in the planning process and developing methods for implementation of policies and plans. Her previous experience also includes serving as Special Assistant for Legislative Affairs and Special Projects to the Director, NHLBI, for 12 years. As a result of this extensive experience, she has special knowledge of administrative management of the NIEHS, and other NIH Institutes. She also has experience and special knowledge at academic medical institutions in establishment and senior administrative management of new units (Centers) within the institutions and has demonstrated ability to work across communities within the government and the public sector.  That expertise in conjunction with her extended past and present knowledge of the Institute will ensure NIEHS mission continuity and optimal outcomes for these projects in accordance with timeframes that cannot be extended.  
Interested parties may identify their interest and capability.  Respond to this requirement by submitting written capabilities/specifications to the Contract Specialist at the address stated above.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, all responses received within 6 days from the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely with the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 6 days of this notice to determine whether a qualified source is more advantageous to the Government, an order will be placed with Gerri Wolfle.  The NAICS Code/Size is 541611/$6.5M.  This procurement is to be processed using Simplified Acquisition Procedures in conjunction with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items and is not expected to exceed the Simplified Acquisition threshold of $100,000.  There is no solicitation package available.  For any questions regarding this announcement, please contact Dee Lunney via email lunney@niehs.nih.gov.*****

<DESC>This effort was originally synopsized under number FA8530-07-R-F2AST.  All future postings for this effort will be posted under FA8530-08-R-21758.

The Future Flexible Acquisition & Sustainment Tool (F2AST) is intended to meet the needs of AFMC Program Directors and Single Managers for speed and flexibility by providing a multi-dimensional task ordering capability, and sufficient ceiling and scope for command (AFMC) - wide usage.  F2AST is intended to be an optional contracting tool that will effectively provide acquisition and sustainment support for all Air Force managed weapon systems and support systems, line replaceable units, shop replaceable units and components.  F2AST will establish the means for the procurement of requirements to include modifications (hardware & software) for the enhancement of reliability, serviceability, maintainability, and performance.  Additionally, the program/contract(s) will include, improved/expanded form/fit/function development programs, procurement of previously owned aircraft, depot partnering opportunities, and maintenance.  F2AST may include spares and repairs which qualify as critical, limited and/or contingency and sole source services to a F2AST contractor or large business subcontractor.  In addition, services that are not reasonably severable from the development, modification or depot maintenance efforts may be included.  No requirement that has been previously performed by any small business or is suitable for a small business shall be issued under F2AST.  Small business categories include: small businesses, small disadvantage businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, women owned small businesses, historically black colleges and universities, and HUB Zone small businesses.

F2AST does not include Military Construction (MILCON), Civil Engineering, Base Operating Support (BOS) or Commercial Items. In addition, F2AST will not be used for new development programs.

The program/contract is estimated at $5.4 billion for a period of seven (7) years consisting of a three year basic contract period and two, two-year option periods. Additional information regarding this program can be found at the following website:       https://pkec.robins.af.mil/FAST2/FAST2.htm#Brf.     

The anticipated contract type will be a Multiple Award Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity contract containing Time and Materials, Fixed Price/Labor Hour, and Cost Reimbursement No Fee line items.  The Request For Proposal is being released on 23 JAN 2008 and closes on or about 22 FEB 2008.           Proposals received will be evaluated using the Technically Acceptable-Performance/Price Tradeoff source selection technique. Only written or faxed responses received directly from the requestor are acceptable. No telephone requests. See Numbered Notes: 26

<SUBJECT>Q -- Advanced Therapeutics for Treating Neutropenia Resulting from Acute Exposure to Ionizing Radiation

<DESC>THIS IS A FORMAL SYNOPSIS OF PROPOSED CONTRACT ACTION NOTICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAR 5.2.  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is seeking to acquire medical countermeasures (MCM) that will support an effective public health emergency response to a radiological or nuclear event.  The United States Government (USG) contemplates a five year Firm Fixed Price single award contract for MCMs that can specifically treat the neutropenia component of Acute Radiation Syndrome.  Neutropenia is defined as the depression of neutrophils which occurs as a component of the hematologic pathologies arising following sufficient exposure to ionizing radiation (h-ARS).   It is the goal of the RFP to obtain advanced development products, i.e., at a development level, as classified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are in no less than Phase 2 of the Investigational New Drug (IND) stage as well as those products which already have approved therapeutic indications.  Prior to the submission of the proposal, the offeror must have met with the appropriate review division at the FDA to consult on the appropriate path for approval of their respective therapeutic for use in pathologies known to be associated with, or as components of, Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).  It is the goal of BARDA to place in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) a Final Drug Product (FDP) which may be used for therapy of neutropenia in human subjects associated with whole body acute exposure to ionizing radiation exceeding 2 Gy.  

The desired product that will be acquired with this contract must be able to support a public health emergency.  The current post-event capabilities of the USG medical emergency personnel to organize, respond, triage, and begin treating patients victimized by a radiological or nuclear event is estimated at no less than 24 hours.  Thus an obligation of this acquisition is to acquire products that have demonstrated efficacy in treating neutropenia (i.e., increase in the peripheral blood neutrophil counts) in appropriate animal models (FDA Animal Efficacy Rule, was established in 2002; see:  Federal Register 67: 37988-37998, May 31, 2002; 21 CFR 601.90 for biologics, and, 21 CFR 313.600-650 for drugs; (with possible human subject studies, if applicable), when administered at a minimum of 24 hours, and preferably greater than 48 hours, following acute exposure to ionizing radiation, and with no pre-exposure prophylaxis.  Other requirements:  (1) delivery of 100,000 treatment courses for neutropenia; (2) Long-term storage temperature in the range of 2-8 degrees C; (3) A defined therapeutic regimen and dosing schedule for treatment of radiation-induced neutropenia; (4) Treatment of neutropenia arising from ARS with the FDP must result in a 30% increase in survival from lethal exposure to ionizing radiation relative to controls (i.e.,LD50, the dose of ionizing radiation which results in 50% lethality in untreated irradiated subjects), plus an increase in neutrophil count.

<DESC>The Naval Air Warfare Center Training System Division intends to award a sole source follow-on contract to Defense Support Services, LLC. (DS2), for the Contractor Instruction, Maintenance, Operation and Training Support (CIMOTS) for the Strategic Sealift Cargo Offload and Discharge Systems (COLDS) in support of Logistics Over the Shore and Joint Logistics Over the Shore (LOTS/JLOTS) and requirements for other government agencies. DS2 is the only known source of maritime services with the unique capabilities and skills to execute these program requirements in a high risk environment. The government has determined that DS2 is the only capable source through extensive market research and from the sources sought synopsis posted on FEDBIZOPS website, January 17, 2008. The resulting contract will be firm fixed priced and negotiations will be conducted using other than full and open competition pursuant to the statutory authority 10 U.S.C. 2304 (c)(1), as implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1, only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The maximum length of the proposed contract will be 5 years, comprised of a one-year base with four one-year options periods to be exercised at the discretion of the Government as per FAR 52.217-9. The applicable North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 611519. 

Requirement Summary: The requirement is to provide CIMOTS/COLDS for the Barge Ferry System at Expeditionary Warfare Training Group, Pacific (EWTGPAC) in San Diego, CA. This requirement includes instructional, maintenance, operational, and training support to produce a qualified COLDS graduate. The Contractor will be required to provide students with formal class training on-shore, followed by operation and maintenance training at sea on equipment associated with this program. The COLDS contract also supports worldwide littoral warfare contingencies for the US Navy, Marine Corps, Army, and Air Force. Presently, the Strategic Sealift Program Office (SSPO) is responsible for three Maritime Pre-positioning Shipping (MPS) squadrons, one each in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean. Each MPS squadron has enough strategic logistics to support a 17,000 Marine Expeditionary Brigade for a 30-day contingency. This strategic war and natural disaster material is comprised of rolling stock, tanks, artillery, food, water, and petroleum products. This contract is performed on both coasts for the Expeditionary Warfare Training Group Pacific San Diego, CA in actual environments using COLDS equipment. Therefore, this contract is heavily supported by the actual operating systems and material that moves Logistics Over the Shore (LOTS) for both dry and wet products from ship to shore. Because this program is mission-driven, frequently 'just-in-time' training is required. This includes classroom and open sea training. This training includes instruction for barge ferry pilots, coxswains, roll-on/roll-off discharge facility (RRDF), elevated causeway, and amphibious assault bulk fuels system, just to name a few. The government-provided equipment which now also includes Improved Navy Lighterage System (INLS) craft as well as the Navy Lighterage (NL) legacy craft, is used for training as well as real world operations include side-loading warping tugs, causeway ferry, conduit training barge, offshore petroleum discharge system, barge ferry simulator, and numerous other equipment. Emerging COLDS systems are continuously being fielded that require new training, operation, and maintenance. The target contract award date for the COLDS contract will be made prior to September 2008.         

Questions concerning this notice may be directed to the Contract Specialist, Rebecca Daniels, at 407-380-4118 or rebecca.e.daniels@navy.mil. If an interested party believes they are capable of performing the required services, please contact the contract specialist. All responses received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. This is an announcement only regarding a sole source acquisition; there is no solicitation available.

<ARCHDATE>03172009
<CONTACT>Sharon Schoenbeck Contract Specialist 3032368931     Sharon_Schoenbeck@blm.gov;
<DESC>The Bureau of Land Management intends to make an award under Commercial Items, FAR Part 12 to Information Handling Service (IHS) 15 Inverness Way E, Englewood, Colorado 80112-5776 under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) provides opportunities for commercial development of domestic energy resources on public and Indian lands through the leasing and production of oil and gas.  Currently, the BLM manages and regulates over 24,000 Federal and 7,000 Indian oil and gas leases mostly throughout the West, but in other energy producing States as well. In determining the volume and value of oil and gas deposits that are contained on Federal and Indian lands, BLM geologists, engineers, and technical support staff conduct reservoir analyses of potential producing reservoirs.  These analyses include conducting paying well determinations to determine whether there are economic resources to authorize leases, approve unitiziation and communitization agreements, conduct drainage and Indian diligence reviews, approve wells spacing units, and determine fair market value of parcels offered at Indian oil and gas lease sales In order to keep pace with the level of drilling and development activities resulting from recent increases in both the price of oil and gas and the demand for energy resources, the use automated software will greatly enhance the BLM's ability to conduct reservoir analyses in a timely and efficient manner.  This software must provide BLM geoscientists and engineers with extensive sets of tools to easily and rapidly resolve key characteristics of a reservoir or prospects by interactively defining geometry, extracting reservoir properties from logs, and making volumetric estimates from surface models.  In order to meet the demand for and access to Federal and Indian oil and gas reservoir, BLM must have unlimited access to publically-available raster logs. Raster logs should be indexed to a vendors well header data and made available as an annual subscription for Texas Railroad Districts1-4 (a minimum of approximately 295,000 raster logs currently available to date); North Louisiana (a minimum of approximately 87,000 raster logs currently available to date), South Louisiana (a minimum of approximately 75,000 raster logs currently available to date) and the Rocky Mountains States of Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming ( a total minimum of approximately 453,000 raster logs currently available to date) -making annual log budgeting easy. Raster logs should also be forthcoming for New Mexico, South Dakota and Utah.  Logs are updated daily Exploration and exploitation geologists may instantly access logs on a "whenever" basis to support prospect studies or plans for drilling. Log availability is easy to see via links in Well CDs and through an online system, so that the user may quickly see what logs are available for the user, as he goes.  Query results will be populated into an online log net system automatically so that the user may quickly download the logs needed. Raster Logs must be enhanced through the process of depth registration. This process involves scaling the vertical axis of the log while maintaining the familiar appearance of a paper log. Every row of pixels, therefore, is calibrated with depth. This allows the user to manipulate well logs onscreen with speed and flexibility, and use them in PC-based analysis in ways similar to digital log equivalents, but at a fraction of the cost. Compatibility: Raster logs must be easy to import into geoscience applications such as PETRA, GeoGraphix and KINGDOM (available in KINGDOM version 8.1). Logs may also be printed using free electronic log software if interpretation software is not being used. Log software may be down loaded from an electronic log system to view and print raster logs. Numerous Benefits: Raster logs, routinely used by geologists, geophysicists and engineers in a host of applications from rank exploration to tertiary recovery is normally purchased on an as-needed basis, thus interrupting a geoscientist's workflow with the need to acquire new data and justify the cost.  This service should provide access to raster logs in the users study area, without having to stop, search for and purchase them. This means the user can build maps and cross sections faster, with less hassle and more efficiency. The acquisition will consist of Unlimited Raster Logs (05/01/2008 - 05/01/2009) for the Rocky Mountains, North Louisiana, South Louisiana, Texas Districts 1-4 and Raster Log Hard Drive Delivery in PETRA Format. The applicable NAICS code is 519190.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Government will consider all responses received by 12:00pm MST, Wednesday, April 16, 2007.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed order based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>Algorithms are sought for fused, and or, coherent cross-platform Radio Frequency (RF) sensing.  The focus of this effort is to improve surveillance utilizing a network, not fusion of disparate sensor products.  The algorithms should be capable of utilizing RF returns from multiple aspects in a time-coordinated sensor network.  These algorithms should enhance detection, tracking, and identification while minimizing sensor and network resource utilization and minimizing the ability of the enemy to exploit and deny sensors.  The network of heterogeneous sensors can use both common and disparate frequencies.  Sensors may arbitrarily enter and leave the network.  It can be assumed that the sensor platform will have access to Global Positioning Service (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) timing and navigation data.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541690   Synopsis for Modeling of Chloroform Metabolism    The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1, with Dr. Gregory L. Kedderis, PH. D. for the development of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for  chloroform (CF) inhalation dosimetry in rats, mice and humans that includes: 1) measures of CF metabolism in liver and kidney, and 2) measured variability of human hepatic blood flow.     The Government requires a contractor that possesses the unique capability/capabilities of having developed a  PBPK model for chloroform that includes metabolic rate constants and microsomal protein recovery data derived from human organ donors; as well as measures of variability of hepatic blood flow derived from literature reports of studies with human volunteers. This model will be revised to also  include measures of CF metabolism in the kidney. This unique capability is essential for contract performance because it is required for development and implementation of a PBPK model to serve as the basis for estimates of metabolism of chloroform in both liver and kidney following an inhalation  exposure. These results will be used as the basis for values to be included in a chemical risk assessment of chloroform.     This procurement will be accomplished under FAR Part 12 Commercial Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements.  THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office  identified above. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. Submit your request in writing to Michael Kreacic at the above address or by fax to 513-487-2107 or by e-mail to kreacic.michael@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Weather Service (NWS), Office of Operational Systems (OOS), Maintenance Branch intends to solicit on a non-competitive basis with Vince Industries of Lenexa, KS for the purchase of 200 Emulators which allows the Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) to communicate with the American Power Conversion (APC) Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS).  The NWS Maintenance Branch has a requirement to purchase a replacement for the SOLA UPS which is obsolete and cannot be repaired due to the unavailability of spare parts.  The APC UPS will replace the SOLA UPS.  In order to accommodate the replacement UPS, the ASOS software is required to communicate with the APC UPS in order to provide status monitoring capability.  Without this monitoring capability, the backup power function of the APC UPS cannot be interrogated for proper operation within the ASOS.  The Emulator?s software is proprietary to Vince Industries.  This software is the only known communications software that meets the requirements of allowing the ASOS software to communicate with the APC UPS.  The quantity purchased at time of award will be 100 with an optional quantity of 100 being purchased within a 1-year period.  This requirement is being accomplished in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1 Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements; 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1).  Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government?s requirement are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation which demonstrates their thorough knowledge and understanding of the ASOS software.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement, of the equipment?s ability to perform as specified, including detailed specification information and other literature sufficient to permit agency analysis.  This is in order to determine bona fide capability to meet the requirement.  A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement on a full and open competitive basis is based upon responses received to the synopsis, is solely within the discretion of the Government.  All responsible sources will be considered in evaluating the determination to issue a sole source contract award.  A firm fixed price purchase order is contemplated for this effort.  Affirmative written responses must be received no later than 24 March 2008, 2:00pm.  All inquiries and responses regarding this synopsis shall be submitted electronically via e-mail to Anita.R.Middleton@noaa.gov.  NOTE 22.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The Army must posture facilities to effectively orient combat capabilities where  they can most effectively organize, train, and deploy to support ongoing operations worldwide.  The Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management (ACSIM) has challenged the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to find ways to streamline its acquisi tion and construction processes in order to reduce costs and speed up overall delivery of projects, while at the same time providing quality facilities.  The Army requires a minimum 15% reduction in cost and a minimum 20% reduction in time to occupancy.  U SACE, in response thereto, created eight Centers of Standardization (COS) that are not only the design centers of expertise but also will become the acquisition experts for the facility types for which the COS is assigned.  Forty-one facility types were id entified for standardization.  Of those forty-one, SWF has been assigned responsibility for the Unaccompanied Enlisted Personnel Housing (UEPH), Basic Training (BT) Barracks, Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Barracks, Warrior in Transition (WIT) barracks  and all related Administrative Buildings and Central Issue Warehouses and General Purpose Warehouses.  The primary execution of the work under the SWF COS responsibility will be based on facility-type Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contrac ts.   The IDIQ contracts are based around current known requirements within four (4) geographic regions identified as Northwest (CO, IA, ID,IL, IN, KS, MI, MN, MO, MT, NE, ND, OH, OR, SD, UT, WA, WI, WY); Northeast (CT, DC, DE, MA, MD, ME, NH, NJ, NY, RI, VA, VT, WV); Southwest (AR, AZ, CA, LA, NM, NV, OK & TX); and Southeast (AL, FL, GA, KY, MS, NC, SC, TN) for an approximate value in excess $3.1 billion.  <BR><BR>SCOPE OF WORK:  <BR><BR>Administrative Facilities <BR><BR>The Battalion Headquarters (BN HQ) facility is comprised of administration, special functions, storage and classroom components for personnel assigned to work in those facilities.

In Phase 1, interested firms or joint venture entities (referred to as Offero rs) may submit certain specified performance capability proposals, demonstrating their capability to successfully execute the design-build construction IDIQ contract resulting from this solicitation. The Government will evaluate the performance capability  proposals in accordance with the criteria described in the solicitation and will select no more than 6 to compete for the contract in Phase 2 of the process.  <BR><BR>In Phase 2, the selected Offerors will submit preliminary technical design proposals for  an initial task, the contract duration, a preliminary schedule and a price proposal.  The Government will evaluate the Phase 2 proposals, in accordance with the criteria described for Phase 2 in the solicitation, and award the contract to the responsible Offeror(s), whose proposal conforms with all the terms and conditions of the solicitation and whose proposal is determined to represent the overall best value to the Government, considering technical-design quality, performance capability, and cost.

<DESC>The purpose of this Modification 0002 to Request for Information 08HQ16-NoSolicitation is to answer questions received as follows: 1.  Question:  Will a listing of interested vendors be published for possible teaming arrangements?  Answer:  This will be considered if and when the Government issues a formal solicitation. 2.  Question:  Will the anticipated solicitation be Full and Open?  Answer:  We are in an information gathering stage.  The determination as to whether we will go forward with an acquisition and the method by which this will be accomplished has not been made. 3.  Question:  Will time be allotted for vendors to survey the site prior to the solicitation to determine their recommendation for either Option 1 or 2?  Answer:  There will be a site visit planned when and if a solicitation is issued. 4.  Question:  If a site survey is not anticipated, has an obsolescence study been performed and will that study be provided to each interested vendor?  Answer:  There has not been an obsolescence study, but the following will apply: 	1-If the USGS generates an obsolescence list, the list will be made known to each vendor. 	2-If the Vendor has a recommendation for declaring a component of the system obsolete, USGS will                 consider that option, but it should better the performance and/or reduce cost.  Specifically, the USGS is                 interested in reducing ground station operations costs. 5.  Question:  As part of the solicitation, will a sparing concept be a requirement?  Answer:  No, sparing will not be a requirement for initial evaluation.  Although, the USGS will be open to recommended options; especially ones that save costs and reduce operational risk. 6.  Question:  What additional logistical requirements are anticipated, ie. RISRPL, recommended spares report, MTBF & MTTR reports, MDemo etc.?  Answer:  The USGS requires recommended spares reports, MTBF papers, and MTTR reports, but not necessarily RISRPL or MDemo items. 7.  Question:  Will a Technical Data Package (TDP), including drawings, be required and at what level?  Will an FCA and PCA be required on the data package?  Answer:  Yes, the USGS will want TDP, "as built" drawings, and all technical manuals. 8.  Question:  Will Interactive Electronic Technical Manuals (IETM) and Computer Based Interactive Training (CBIT) be a requirement?   Answer:  No, IETMs and CBITs will not be a requirement. 9.  Question:  Who is the original equipment manufacturer/supplier? Answer:  Antenna: Datron Transco 	 Integration: Allied Signal and Raytheon 10.  Question:  How long has the antenna been deployed? Answer:  Built 1997 and operational 10 years (since 1998). 11.  Question:  What is the antenna Feed? Answer:  Dual-Polarization S and X-Band. 12.  Question:  What is the antenna control unit's make and model? Answer:  Standard Datron ACU; model number 128280-01. 13.  Question:  Where is the antenna site physically located? Answer:  USGS EROS Center, 47914 252nd Street, Sioux Falls, SD 57198 14.  Question:  Your Source Sought notice mentions that NAICS code 334200 will be used to determine small business status.  However, the notice does not indicate whether or not the evaluated procurement will in fact be set-aside for a small business.  Has a determination been made yet as to whether this will be a small business set-aside?  Or will that be determined later? Answer:  The Request for Information was issued to gather information for planning purposes.  A determination has not been made at this time as to whether we will move forward with a solicitation or what type it will be.

<DESC>The Fish and Wildlife Service has a requirement for a 12 volt battery powered electroshock unit backpack with remote on/off breaker switch box and elasped time meter (in line anode style), that will be used to capture Sea Lamprey. Light open-frame design minimizes weight fatigue in the field-only 25.5 lbs. for complete system with 18 amp-hr. battery (excluding anode and cathode). Even lighter with 12 amp-hr. battery. - Direct-dial controls permit quick setting changes and viewing of output voltage, current, and battery voltage. Separate optional elapsed time display. No scrolling through VCR-style menus and buttons to set up or view parameters. - Uses single 12 volt sealed lead acid battery, 12 or 18 amp-hr. Battery externally accessible to permit rapid field changing. Battery terminals are electrically isolated from output. - Non electrically-conductive enclosure, backpack frame and battery support bracket. - Capacitive pulse-discharge output, 200 watts average power, Peak voltage 250 V, peak current 10 amps. Capable of 30 Joules per pulse. Conductivity range 200 to 1300 uS. - Automatic output voltage control to maintain constant peak voltage with varying water conductivity and changes in pulse rate or duty cycle. - Selectable bursted pulse wavetrains (two pulses on/two pulses off, or three pulses on/one pulse off) for effective lamprey capture. - Two independent pulsing channels that can be accessed by a switch on the anode pole: Channel 1: Continuously variable rate selection from 1.0 to 10.0 pps with a resolution of 0.1 pps and accuracy of ý 5%; continuously variable duty cycle selection from 1 to 50% with a resolution of 1% and an accuracy of ý 2% absolute. Channel 2: Continuously variable rate selection from 10 to 1000 pps with a resolution of 1 pps and accuracy of ý 5%; continuously variable duty cycle selection from 1 to 50% with a resolution of 1% and an accuracy of ý 2% absolute. - Continuously variable peak voltage selection by direct reading dial from 0 to 250 V peak in two ranges (0-125 / 125-250). Resolution 1 volt, accuracy ý 5%. - Output voltage LED monitor (Front panel LED increases intensity with increased output voltage and duty cycle. At very slow pulse rates it flashes with every pulse verifying high voltage pulses are being delivered to output connectors. - Optional red LED on cathode pole lights up to indicate peak current through the water of 0.1 amp or higher. - Remote ON/OFF main power switch/breaker option which locates power switch in remote watertight box attached to lower part of backpack frame for easy access by operator. - Electrically isolated output. Tilt detectors with fast electronic shut-down for user protection. Additional water immersion detector shut-down for "vertical falls" in water where user does not bend over far enough to trip tilt detector. - Digital LCD display that meters either peak output current, peak output voltage (rather than average values), or battery voltage (selectable by 3-position panel switch). Built-in resettable LCD timer option to accumulate actual shocking time in minutes and seconds or all seconds (hour/hundreths of hour also available). Timer display is separate from metering display so both time and voltage or current are immediately viewable. - Electronic short-circuit, and over-current protection. Audible and visible fault identification for tilt/water immersion, over-current, and low battery conditions. - Alert tone during pulsing with variable volume control. Optional hi-intensity LED also available that lights during pulsing. - Modular construction for rapid field replacement of printed circuit board and inverter power module This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance FAR subpart 12.6 as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.

Contractors will be expected to accomplish a wide variety of individual construction tasks, including design/build, renovation, additions/upgrades, along with specific work in Heating/Ventilation/Air Conditioning, electrical, mechanical and other major trades at Andersen AFB, Guam, and Hickam AFB, Hawaii.  Description of the work will be identified in each individual task order.  Individual task orders may range between $200,000 - $5,000,000.  The Government reserves the right to award separate contracts to service Andersen AFB and Hickam AFB, or single contracts combining service to both.  Each contract awarded will contain a basic 12-month period and four 12-month option periods.  The Government anticipates awarding 3-5 contracts for coverage of Andersen AFB and 5-7 contracts for coverage at Hickam AFB.  The government will evaluate offers and select the awardees utilizing the best value source selection procedures described in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 15.3) and Air Force Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (AFFARS 5315.3).  In using this best value approach, the government seeks to award to those offerors who give the Air Force the greatest confidence they will best meet our requirements affordably.  While the government source selection evaluation team and the source selection authority will strive for maximum objectivity, the source selection process, by its nature, is subjective.  This may result in an award being made to higher rated, higher priced offerors where the decision is consistent with the evaluation factors in the RFP and the selection authority reasonably determines that the technical superiority, and/or overall business approach, and/or superior past performance, of higher priced offerors outweighs the cost difference.   Details will be described in the RFP when issued.  This acquisition is being considered for Section 8(a) set-aside, partial HUBZone set-aside, unrestricted competition, or a combination of these. 

In responding to this sources sought synopsis, please indicate your (a) interest as a prime contractor, teaming partner, joint venture, primary subcontractor and indicate (b) if your business is 8(a) and/or HUBZone certified, large, or small, (c) provide evidence of recent (within three (3) years), relevant (multiple trade, multiple task order) experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, and points of contact with telephone numbers and a statement as to why the project is relevant, and (d) availability of bonding of at least $10,000,000 (maximum anticipated for each performance period) for this project.  If you did not respond to the initial sources sought, please also indicate (e) whether you are interested in working at Hickam AFB, Andersen AFB or both bases.   An actual solicitation is expected to be issued mid April 2008.  The closing date and time for submission of offers will be contained in the solicitation package. The entire solicitation, including the specifications and drawings, will be made available only on the Electronic Posting System (EPS) Web Site at http://www.eps.gov at that time.  Potential offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation package and any other pertinent information and for downloading their own copy of the solicitation package.

<DESC>BAA for FY2008-FY2010 Chemical and Biological  Defense Initiative Fund & Chemical/Biological Technologies Directorate Physical Science and Technology Division New Initiatives

THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION.

The purpose of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to solicit research proposals for Chemical and Biological Defense Program, Defense Threat Reduction Agency requirements for the Chemical and Biological Defense Initiative Fund (CBDIF) BAA and the Physical Science & Technology (S&T) Division New Initiatives BAA.

SCOPE:

The DoD CBDP, Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the Joint Science and Technology Office for Chemical and Biological Defense (JSTO-CBD) are seeking optimum approaches to meet technology objectives within both the Physical Science & Technology and the Medical Science & Technology areas for the CBDIF, and the Physical Science & Technology New Initiatives.

PURPOSE:

The CBDIF goal is to fund new and innovative chemical and biological science and technology projects across a wide range of military operations. Established in FY2003, it is Congressionally directed with the intent to provide funds via a competitive acquisition to non-Government entities. Proposals may only address those topics presented in Attachment 8 of the BAA.

The Physical Science & Technology Division, Chemical and Biological Technologies Directorate, in its continuing mission, seeks new and innovative ideas for experimental and theoretical development of technologies to fill DoD requirements for chemical and biological defense. The goal is to identify and select science and technology projects that can be transitioned to joint acquisition programs. Proposals may only address those topics presented in Attachment 8 of the BAA.

SOLICITATION APPROACH AND OVERVIEW:

This BAA is a multi-year BAA, remaining effective for three years from the initial date of issuance, unless amended otherwise. Multiple calls for proposals may occur in conjunction with this BAA. The topics and timelines (Attachment 8) published in the initial issuance are firm. In the future, ongoing, new or emerging requirements may necessitate amendment of the BAA to include new or different topics. At any time that the topics are amended, new proposal submission milestones (timelines) will be specified and as applicable any limitations specific to the topics will be noted.

Over the span of its term, this BAA will solicit basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development proposals for the topics presented in Attachment 8 and in effect at the time. Depending on the nature of requirements and/or available funding, each of these research categories may or may not be included in the most current List of Topics. Proposals may each address Basic Research, or Applied Research and/or Advanced Technology Development as specified in each topic. Proposals will not be accepted or considered that combine Basic Research with Applied Research and/or Advanced Technology Development.

The Government encourages proposals that span a wide spectrum of possible technical and business solutions in response to the specific technology topics stated in Attachment 8 of this BAA. The Government reserves the right to award any combination of approaches which offer the best overall value to the Government, and to oversee any and all processes and approaches once ongoing.

The full range of flexible assistance and acquisition related statutory authority arrangements available to DTRA are possible results from this announcement including but not limited to contracts, grants, and Other Transaction Agreements. Each of the several applicable procurement instruments offer different advantages, liabilities and responsibilities for offerors and the Government.

Questions regarding the technical and administrative content of this BAA must be sent to cbdif-cbt08-10baa@dtra.mil. All questions must include the BAA number in the subject line. DTRA will post questions and answers to the FedBizOpps website that are relevant to all potential offerors.

Background:  DSCC is the lead DLA center for maritime weapon systems.  DSCC is responsible for providing the Navy with the highest level of support, worldwide.  It is DLA?s goal to provide the best value to our military customer while reducing costs and improving efficiencies.  To meet our goals and future customer challenges, DSCC is continuing to benchmark with the private sector to determine which industry practices can be adopted to support the requirements of the Navy.  DSCC, in working with the Navy, has determined that a performance based contract would effectively support the warfighter.

Maritime, may elect to solicit/award by Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) to single or multiple vendors.  Prospective vendors may respond to individual or all CLIN?s.

The contractor shall perform standard original equipment manufacturer (OEM) recommended preventitive and scheduled maintenance, calibration and system inspections of equipment listed in Statement Of Work (SOW). Also, the contractor shall perform emergent repairs and modifications on equipment listed in the SOW when requested by Government Technical Representatives. The anticipated period of performance consists of a base period and three (3) 12 month option periods. The proposed contract will be a firm fixed-price type contract.

The solicitation will be posted to FedBizOpps on or about February 11, 2008. 

Offerors are required to submit past performance information, to include contract number, description of product or service, customer point of contact information, period of performance and value. Information shall be provided for past performance contracts/experiences within the past three years. The Government reserves the right to obtain information for use in the evaluation of past performance from any and all sources including sources outside of the Government. Offerors lacking relevant past performance history will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably on past performance. However, the quote of a company with no relevant past performance history, while not rated favorably or unfavorably for past performance, may not represent the most advantageous quote to the Government and thus, may be an unsuccessful quote when compared to the responses of other quoters.

The Government will give greater consideration to the contracts that the Government feels are most relevant to the RFP.

<SUBJECT>99 -- USAF Fee-For-Service Aerial Refueling Pilot Program
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-FFS-AR-XR001

<DESC>This is a combined Sources Sought Synopsis and Request for Information (RFI).  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. All responsible businesses, including small businesses, are encouraged to respond to this RFI.  As proscribed in the FY08 National Defense Authorization Act, the Air Force is in the process of implementing a fee-for-service aerial refueling (FFS/AR) pilot program as a complement to existing Air Force organic capability. The purpose of the pilot program is to assess the feasibility and utility of incorporating commercial service provider(s) in Air Force operations long-term. This Sources Sought Synopsis is in support of a market research effort being conducted by Aeronautical Systems Center (ASC) to determine potential sources capable of providing this fee-for-service aerial refueling service. Under the pilot program, each service provider refueling aircraft must be able to off-load fuel utilizing centerline flying boom equipment and a probe and drogue system. The latter may be satisfied by one or both of: 1) centerline hose/drogue equipment; 2) multi-point hose/drogue equipment (i.e. wingtip refueling pods). No developmental funding is available to capitalize or establish sources capable of providing this service. Respondents should also assume that no government furnished property will be available to establish any commercial aerial refueling capability (such as excess KC-135 aircraft or spare aerial refueling components such as center-line booms). The government is interested in identifying sources of commercial-off-the-shelf aerial refueling services that are or will be capable of initiating performance in the FY09/10 timeframe. Potential sources should include their size status for NAICS code 481212.

This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only.     In accordance with Part 10 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation the Government is conducting Market Research. This Market Research is for information and planning purposes only.     Before submitting any information to the Government, be advised that the Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of these questions or to otherwise pay for the information you provide. Your responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as a proposal.

Submission of Proprietary Information Caution: The government appreciates that interested firms may not be able to respond to this RFI without disclosing information deemed "proprietary" or "competition sensitive". Data submitted in response to this RFI will be widely distributed and discussed within the government as it will be used to assist in developing the acquisition strategy for any fee-for-service aerial refueling demonstration program. It is the responsibility of Respondents to clearly mark submitted information with appropriate restrictive markings. Respondents are further advised that the government's analysis of your responses may require disclosure of your responses to Advisory and Assistance Services contractor personnel. If you do not wish your information disclosed to the government's support contractors, or require non-disclosure agreements be established with them prior to their being granted access to your information, your data must be marked accordingly.         

Any information provided by the Government at this time is preliminary and may be updated or changed prior to a formal release of a Request for Proposal.

The government may award contracts for concept refinement studies if more detailed information on fee-for-service aerial refueling is needed based on responses to this RFI. The concept refinement studies may be awarded through the Broad Area Announcement (BAA) process. If concept refinement studies are needed, they will be synopsized approximately two months from the date of this announcement.

As set forth in the FY08 NDAA, the pilot program will be not less than five years. Multiple contractors may be selected to participate in the pilot program.  The pilot program will not exceed more than two aerial refueling aircraft per provider.     The pilot program may encompass and/or evaluate the following missions as directed in the FY08 NDAA: testing support, training support to receiving aircraft, homeland defense support, deployment support, air bridge support, aeromedical evacuation, and emergency air refueling. Additional missions may be incorporated as Air Force requirements are established.

4. 1.1.3.  Hours of Operation.  Contractor supplied equipment and crews must be available exclusively to the Government at all times, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, for transporting cargo to and between the points stipulated or as may be directed by the Government, or to stand by at an origin, destination, or intermediate point as necessary and specified by the Government.
4. 3.1.  Barge and Tug Requirements.
Pricing of services does not include fuel (see Bunker Fuel Expenses)
The contractor shall provide the following:
4. 3.1.1.  Barge.
Two barge tows, each with a total deliverable capacity of not less than 50,000 barrels. Each tow must consist of either two individual 25,000 barrel barges, or not more than three barges total, one of which has a capacity of at least 25,000 barrels. Contractor is required to comply with the maximum safe navigable draft and length over all for all loading and discharge locations.  The Contractor remains responsible for maximum length over all, however the government reserves the right to light load equipment where the government knows there is a shallow draft or require the tow to stand off awaiting safe berthing conditions, e.g.: high tide.
4. 3.1.1.1.  On-Call Tow.  
These services will be ordered separately as priced within the Schedule of Rates.  The government will have the option to add additional tows or terminate existing on-call tows as traffic patterns change.  The contractor must provide for one additional tow when requested by the government with a minimum of 15 days notice.  On-call tows must be of the same capacity as those listed in paragraph 4. 3.1.1.  The equipment ordered will be in service for a minimum of 30 days.  The government will provide the effective dates of service for the tow via contract modification.  The government may terminate any on-call tow with a minimum of  30 days notice if that tow is no longer required.  Barge and tug requirements will be consistent within the parameters as provided in paragraph 4.  3.1. The equipment must meet all government inspection requirements addressed in paragraph 4.  3.3 and must remain in dedicated service until released back to the contractor.  Dedicated service is defined as the start and end date of the requested service. Payment will not commence until the tow is made available at the initial loading point, as specified in the contract modification, and will end on the last day of requested service upon cargo discharge at the destination point.  Any subsequent changes to schedule details (e.g., date, loading port) required for expedience of the government shall occur only upon modification of the contract by the Contracting Officer.  Otherwise, the contractor is responsible for all costs associated with positioning the equipment at the 
initial loading point.  Payment for the on-call services will be in accordance with the prices listed in the Schedule of Rates.
4. 3.1.2.1.  Cargo Pumping System    
A cargo pumping system with necessary hoses and connections capable of completely discharging and stripping the cargo tanks without outside power or assistance from the shore.  The average load/discharge rate for all destinations shall be a minimum of 2,000 barrels per hour (BPH) at a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch (PSI) from the barge manifold including quantities stripped from cargo tanks.  This effectively means that the total cargo shall be loaded/discharged as a minimum, in time represented by the total cargo stated in barrels divided by 2,000 barrels per hour.
4. 3.1.2.2.  Cargo Tank Stripping System
An independent cargo tank stripping system capable of stripping all but a maximum of 2 barrels of product per cargo tank, not to exceed 10 barrels for the entire barge.  The discharge rate during tank stripping operations may be less than the minimum rates stipulated above.
4. 3.1.2.3.  Water Stripping System
A water stripping system, separate from the cargo tank stripping system, for removal of residual water, prior to discharge of cargo.  All water and cargo tank stripping and discharge lines shall be fully visible from the deck.
4. 3.1.2.4.  Gauge Point Marks and Calibration     
Permanent gauge point marks with reference height stenciled to the deck or compartment hatch, certified calibration charts not exceeding eight years in age (provided that no structural alterations have been performed subsequent to the calibration date), trim correction tables and legible draft markings.  Barges shall be recalibrated as needed at the Contractor?s expense during the contract period.
4. 3.1.2.5.  Stainless Steel Tanks
Barges with stainless steel or epoxy-coated tanks are preferred, but barges with uncoated tanks may be offered.  For the purpose of this contract, any commercial epoxy coating impervious to petroleum products, except coal tar epoxy, is suitable.
4. 3.1.2.6.  Steel Valves
Steel valves shall be an integral part of all barges used in the performance of this contract.
4. 3.1.2.7  Spill Rails
Spill rails are required on all barges.
4. 3.1.2.8  Sectional Fuel Delivery Hose
When required, the Contractor shall provide 200 feet of sectional fuel delivery hose and various coupling attachments necessary for over-the-water fuel loading to ships.  The Contractor is liable for any damage or loss resulting from faulty equipment or caused by Contractor negligence.
4. 3.1.3.  Tug
The tug for each tow offered must have between 1,500 and 2,100 HP, and be suitable in design and power to properly navigate the lower and upper Mississippi River, the Tombigbee and Arkansas Rivers, and the Gulf Intra-coastal Waterway.
4. 3.2.  Contractor Owned or Leased Equipment
The Contractor shall own the equipment performing the transportation service or the Contractor shall have the equipment under long-term lease for the duration of the contract period to include the base year and all option years.  The Government requires verification of this requirement at the time of contract award.
4. 3.3.  Barge Inspection and Acceptance
At the start of this contract, the Contractor shall provide tug and barge equipment that conforms to the specifications of this contract (see Section 4. 3.1 Barge And Tug Requirements), and that passes the Government's loading inspection.  Equipment will be inspected at loading ports as specified by the COR.  Government inspection and acceptance of the Contractor's equipment is a condition precedent to the Government's obligation to pay the monthly rates set forth in the Schedule of Rates.  The monthly rates do not go into effect, and the Government incurs no obligation to make monthly payments, until the Government's Quality Assurance Representative (QAR) has approved the Contractor's equipment for loading in accordance with Section 4. 3.3.2.
4. 3.3.1 Performance Objective - Pre-Service Inspection
Not later than 15 days prior to the initiation of transportation services, the Contractor shall make its tugs and barges available for inspection and acceptance by the Government at the loading specified by the COR.  If the Contractor fails to provide conforming equipment by this deadline, the Contractor shall be subject to termination by the Contracting Officer under the Termination for Cause clause.  Tows must be presented cleaned, gas free, and free of temporary patches.  The Contractor shall provide a valid marine chemist certificate to the Government QAR prior to inspection.  Contractor must ensure that all cargo and vent lines have been drained of previous cargo, and flushed with hot water.  Cargo tanks and bulkheads must be free of water, loose rust, sludge, mud, silt, and foreign objects.  The Government QAR shall take a sample of scale from inside of the cargo tanks and test it to determine the potential effects of the corrosion and gum characteristics on the cargo to be loaded.  The Contractor shall prepare the barge for inspection at its own expense.  Acceptance of the equipment by the Government shall in no way be construed to attest to the seaworthiness of the barge or to other requirements of the U.S. Coast Guard.  The Government's QAR shall issue written confirmation of acceptance of equipment through the COR.  Once inspected, the tug and barge equipment will be considered to have entered into dedicated service on this contract.

The Contractor shall maintain, clean (including slop tanks), repair, position and operate its equipment to ensure its performance under the contract, including providing fuel to operate the tug and barge pump engines and shall provide all crew living provisions.  The Contractor shall pay all associated costs and expenses.
4. 3.5.  Provide a Licensed Tankerman      
The Contractor is responsible for following all governing regulations and statutes in providing licensed tankermen at all loading and discharge ports identified in the PWS.  The licensed tankermen must gauge barge tanks jointly with the Government QAR and make a record of quantities on required forms including Barge Ullage (DD Form 2479), or suitable commercial equivalent.  When load or delivery hours exceed the maximum tankerman hours allowed, a replacement tankerman is authorized.  When exercising this option, the COR should be notified within 24 hours of replacement.  Email notification is sufficient for this requirement.  The optional on-call additional licensed tankerman expense will be paid in accordance with Paragraph 4. 5.4.
4. 4.1.  Equipment Maintenance
4. 4.1.1.  Temporary Patching/Repairs

The Contractor shall provide notice of scheduled maintenance with expected duration of maintenance not less than 24 hours before the date it is scheduled.
4. 4.1.2.4.  Substitute Equipment
When Contractor owned equipment is Out-of-Service Long-Term, the Contractor shall substitute owned or leased equipment.  The COR and/or QAR must approve, in advance, 
the substitution of equipment, provided the substitute equipment is equivalent to the Contractor's original (permanent) equipment (i.e., meets the specifications and requirements in Section 3, Contractor Furnished Equipment And Crew).  The substitute equipment provided by the Contractor shall be at no additional cost to the Government.  
4. 4.2.  Cargo Delivery Services

<DESC>***MOD 04 - RESPONSES TO INDUSTRY QUESTIONS 

1. Question:  In the synopsis, it states "The Government desires a protective armor kit that could reduce the ballistic threat to critical systems on the H-53E helicopters."  In the "CURRENT SYSTEM DESIGN" paragraph, the requirement focuses on engine nacelles, main and tail rotor flight controls, fuel and hydraulic lines.  It states that a degree of personnel protection is provided by existing armored pilot seats and ballistic protection system that covers the cockpit and passenger compartment floor area and the aircraft ramp.

My question is as follows:  Does the RFI want industry to address only the requirement as defined above while maintaining the existing protection system identified or do they want industry to identify a complete solution inclusive of replacement of the existing system for the cargo floor and ramp?

Response:  Please address only the requirement as defined in the synopsis while maintaining the existing protection system identified.

2. Question:  I need the square footage of the outboard engine cowlings and the square footage of the upper nacelle from the forward hydraulic bay to aft of the exhaust (entire upper nacelle).

Response:  This sources sought is for informational purposes only and is NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  Any solicitation issued for this effort will articulate the Government's requirement.

** This concludes MOD 04 **

The Naval Air Systems Command, Aircraft Support Contracts Department (AIR 2.3.2.1), Patuxent River, MD 20670-1127 is seeking information for potential sources regarding industry technologies available to protect all H 53E helicopter engines and other flight-critical systems from small arms projectiles with the intention of procuring the material and services on a competitive basis.  

THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.  

It is a market research gathering tool used to determine potential business firms capable of providing these services prior to determining the method of acquisition and issuance of a Request for Proposal.  This should not be construed as a promise to contract. The Government is not obligated to and will not pay for any information received from potential sources as a result of this synopsis.  

CURRENT SYSTEM DESIGN 

The H-53E-series helicopter is powered by three T64-series turboshaft engines.  The installed engines are covered by fiberglass cowlings hinged along the upper side.  The cowlings provide an aerodynamic fairing but no ballistic threat protection.  Damage to other flight-critical systems, such as main rotor and tail rotor flight controls and fuel and hydraulic lines, can force the aircraft out of its mission.  The helicopter is subject to hostile small arms fire and other threats when operating in combat areas.  A degree of personnel protection is provided by existing armored pilot seats and a ballistic protection system that covers the cockpit and passenger compartment floor areas, as well as the aircraft ramp.  The Navy is interested in solutions that would mitigate the threat of downing an aircraft due to damage to these vital aircraft systems from small arms and similar threats.  
 
DESIRED CAPABILITIES  
The Government desires a protective armor kit that could reduce the ballistic threat to critical systems on the H-53E helicopters.  The Government envisions a mission kit of armor panels or other protective means that could be installed as needed on any aircraft having mounting provisions.  The system would be easily removable at the organizational level for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low-threat/no-threat environment.  There is relevant engineering design experience with a steel plate armor system for the CH-53D helicopter; however, the government has not yet defined a specific set of components to be protected on the H-53E.  The intent of this RFI is to assess the state-of-the art of the technology available in lightweight armor products that could be applied to meet this requirement.
The government is interested in unclassified written submittals of concepts and rough-order-of-magnitude cost estimates for protective systems with the capabilities described above.  Respondents must clarify if their firm can provide a total systems approach for commercial or non-developmental items that could be modified to meet the Navy?s needs.  Respondents should also describe their relevant experience with similar systems and the process they would envision for the development and qualification of a product to meet the stated need.  Please submit all questions to Ronald N. Guy, Jr., Code AIR-2.3.2.1, at email ronald.guy@navy.mil or alternatively at (301) 757-5223.     

TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS
The Government envisions a solution for the H-53E Critical Systems Armor (CSA) kits that meets the following operational and program requirements:
1.  Non-Developmental Item.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection should be a non-developmental item to the maximum extent possible.
2.  Qualification.  The H-53E CSA material that provides ballistic protection must be qualified and demonstrate compliance to the helicopter?s environment.  This includes, but is not limited to compliance with MIL-STD-810F, Change 3 and/or DO-160E environmental conditions for helicopters.  Proof of qualification / compliance in robust dust / sand, fog / rain, snow / ice, exposure to contaminants, and salt environments should be addressed in the response.
3.  Mission Removable.  The H-53E CSA will consist of an A-Kit and B-Kit.  The goal is to have commonality between CH-53E and MH-53E systems. The A kit, also referred to as installation kit, shall consist of permanent or semi-permanent installations / modifications to the aircraft.  It is desirable to have the H-53E CSA installed with little or no permanent aircraft modifications.  It is recognized that a specific A-Kit may be required for each helicopter type/model/series.   The B-Kit, also referred to as the mission removable kit, shall consist of components / assemblies which may be installed or removed as mission requirements dictate.  It is desirable that the CSA Kit would be easily removable for weight reduction when the aircraft is operating in a low threat / no threat environment.  The time to install / remove the B-Kit items will not impact mission availability for the aircraft.  The H-53E CSA must be practical to be retrofitted at a USMC organizational level facility, or by a field modification team / installed at the organizational level.
4.  Maintenance, Inspection and Repair.  The Government desires a system with minimal maintenance and inspection requirements at the organizational level.  The system should also be easily repairable for deployed units.      
5.  H-53E Performance Impact.  It is desired that installation of the H-53E CSA kit will result in limited degradation to existing range, performance / handling, and/or existing mission capabilities of either H-53E platforms. 
6.  Ballistic Protection Characteristics.  The H-53E CSA kit will provide adequate ballistic protection for its threat environment.  Interested parties should provide a summary of the proposed survivability capabilities within the H-53E CSA Kit proposal.  Threat magnitude capability (MIL-PRF-46103 standard or industry equivalent), repeatability and number of hits per a given area should be included as a minimum.  The contractor should address proven demonstration of this capability (through test and qualification data, etc) in their response. 
7.  Ballistic Protection / Coverage Areas and Weight.  The Government has not yet defined a specific set of components and/or areas to be protected on the H-53E platforms by the H-53E CSA Kit.  It is desired that the contractor define proposed coverage areas for the H-53E CSA kit in their response, and applicable weight for the CSA Kit based on their proposed coverage areas.   A desired CSA armor area density envisioned is 6.5 pounds per square feet or less. 

CAPABILITY STATEMENT PACKAGE

Documentation should be in bullet format and must address, at a minimum, any prior/current corporate experience with the military performing efforts of similar size and scope within the last three years, including contract number, unclassified technical performance capabilities, organization/platform supported, and contract value.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Any resulting contract is anticipated to be a security classification level of Secret.  Any resulting contract shall be compliant with the specialty metals restriction of the Berry Amendment (10 U.S.C. 2533a and 2533b) in accordance with DFARS clauses 225.7002 and 252.225-7014 Alt. 1, inclusive of Class Deviations 2008-O0002 (which supersedes 2006-O004 and 2007-O011), unless an exception applies.

<DESC>Modification to response date. Response deadline for this soliciation is COB 5:00 p.m. HST April 7, 2008.<BR><BR>A.	General Information.  <BR><BR>The Pacific Region (TRBO Region 12), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of 18 Army, Navy,  Air Force, and Marine Corps Medical Treatment Facilities (MTFs) in Hawaii, Guam, Okinawa, Japan, and Korea announces a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of IV Securement Devices.<BR><BR>The primary objecti ve of this program is to standardize the quality of care across the region based on a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source(s) at the best possible price. It is also intended that standardized products be obtai ned through the DoD Prime Vendor Program.  <BR><BR>The major facilities in the region include Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medic al Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.<BR><BR>This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia (DSCP), Directorate of Medical Materiel. In order to participa te, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendors for the program. This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow P rime Vendors to distribute their products. This RFRIAQ is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and is not a contract. For additional information regarding DSCPs Prime vendor program please access their web site at https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil<BR><BR >The resulting Regional Incentive Agreement (RIA) will be for a base period of 2 years (24 months) from date of selection with three 12-month option periods. Anticipated selection date is December 2008. The evaluation will be based on clinical, technical, and pricing factors. The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become mor e important. The selection will be determined utilizing Best value/ trade-off criteria. The selection of a single vendor is anticipated. However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make tw o or more selections for RIAs. In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  <BR>   <BR>Point of Contact<BR>Susan Hwang, TRBO Team Leader<BR>808-433-3686, susan.hwang@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>Cheryl Janu s, Clinical Analyst<BR>808-433-7985, cheryl.janus@amedd.army.mil<BR><BR>B.

Submissions must be received by 5:00 p.m. HST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought n otice. Vendors that fail to meet this submittal deadline will be disqualified from participating. All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.  <BR><BR>This process will include vendor requirements to provide electroni c responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price quotes. Due to the potential for email to be lost in transmission from network security, etc., vendors are strongly encouraged to confirm with the Regional POC stated above that their initial submission, quotes, and literature or other requested information has actually arrived at the Regional Tri-Service Business Office (TRBO) via email. Each submitting vendor is advised to confirm receipt,  allowing adequate time for resubmission before the due date/time, should a problem occur with the first submission.  <BR><BR>C.	 Evaluation Criteria.  <BR><BR>The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing body of the standardization process . This board includes clinicians and logisticians from the Military Treatment Facilities within the Pacific Region. They are the deciding officials for this initiative. The Region intends to evaluate price quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without d iscussions. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best responses to all technical and/or company questions listed in this a nnouncement. Vendor quotes should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region). Additionally, the Region reserves the right to con duct discussions and request revised quotes, if it is determined to be necessary. <BR><BR>Phase I  Technical/Company Evaluation Process.  <BR>Interested vendors are to respond to this FBO announcement by emailing their intent to participate to the above  POC by the required response date. Based on vendor responses, the TRBO POC will request detailed responses to the technical/company criteria from each vendor. Vendors are required to meet/provide responses to the technical/company criteria stated below. A ll technical/company criteria are weighted equally. The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine the acceptability of each vendor. After the review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will b e qualified/invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.<BR><BR>Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Genera lly, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the business concern submitting the quote is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendors responses, the evaluators  have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have  a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items with Cardinal Health, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendo r intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendors information provided is factually correct. Any misrepresenta tion of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.<BR><BR>The following Technical/Company Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardization initiative: <BR><BR>1.	Vendor must manufacture and/or distribute a complete  product line of IV Securement Devices. A complete line of product is defined as the MTFs requirements for usage items in the product line. Usage items are defined in the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work as DAPA items ordered at l east once per month, and at least one unit per order. At a minimum, the following items are required: <BR>"	IV Securement Device that provides catheter stabilization that preserves the integrity of the access device and prevents catheter migration and loss  of access in accordance with the Intravenous Nurses Society (INS) standard for Securement and stabilization of intravenous access devices.<BR>Provide certification of all brands of this product line that you manufacturer or distribute with the initial sub mittal.<BR>2.	Vendors must have a DAPA or be in the process of applying for a DAPA number for the IV Securement Devices product line. Provided the DAPA number or proof of the application process with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors that fail to h ave a DAPA or show a lack of progress in obtaining a DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>3.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the regional prime vendor Cardinal Health for distribution in this Region and provide certification of this with the initial submittal. (Note that vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified). <BR>4.	Vendors must provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative. Where lower FSS prices are available,  DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price. Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off DAPA (Note that vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified).<BR>5.	Vendors must  provide electronic and hard copy pricing quotes and competitive product cross-reference in electronic MS Excel format upon request.<BR>6.	Vendor must provide educational tools, product literature, and materials for IV Securement Devices as well as no cost  samples for the evaluation. Describe your available company educational tools and material resources with the initial submittal.<BR>7.	Vendor must provide customer service (telephonic and e-mail) for regional facilities. Identify company resources and cap abilities for such support with the initial submittal.<BR>8.	Vendors must have a local vendor representative available in the region. Provide contact information, i.e. name, address, phone number, and e-mail address with the initial submittal.<BR>9.	Vendor  will provide a device which meets the Intravenous Nurses Society (INS) standard for Securement and stabilization of intravenous access devices. The standard is  Infusion Nurses Standards of Practice #43: Catheter Stabilization Standards, which states catheter stabilization shall be used to preserve the integrity of the access device and to prevent catheter migration and loss of access; catheters shall be stabili zed using a method that does not interfere with assessment and monitoring of access site or impede vascular circulation or delivery of prescribed therapy. This standard is met through evidenced based clinical research in which the device meets this standa rd. The vendor will provide documentation of the research, if requested. The rationale is to provide patient safety, avoid pain and suffering, avoid potential loss of venous access, avoid inflammatory processes at site, and to prevent IV access site infect ions.<BR><BR>Phase II  Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process <BR><BR>The multi-disciplinary TPRB clinical team will request samples (no charge) from the product line to be clinically evaluated at select Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are require d to ship their no cost samples directly to the designated MTFs and will be allowed 21 calendar days from the date of notification to complete the delivery. Samples must be shipped to arrive at the MTF by COB, 5:00 p.m. HST, on the 21st calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process.<BR><BR>Specific MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a likert scale, with a one to five rat ing. One (1) = strongly disagree, Two (2) = disagree, Three (3) = neutral, Four (4) = agree, and Five (5) = strongly agree. All clinical/performance criteria are equally weighted.<BR><BR>To determine acceptability, a TPRB Clinical Team comprised of medical  professionals from multiple disciplines will evaluate the products based on the evaluation criteria below. The TPRB Clinical Team intends that clinical evaluations be conducted in a clinical setting; however, the Government reserves the right to conduct e valuations in a clinical setting, if needed. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. <BR>The following Clinical/Performance Evaluation Criteria have been established for this standardiz ation initiative: <BR><BR>1.	IV Securement device instructions for application to the skin are clear. (If any skin preparation is required, the method contains the steps. For example, user is to wipe the skin with an identified proprietary solution or 70% isopropyl alcohol, and wipe skin to ensure that skin site is dry. The method for removing the coverings or tabs on the adhesive portions of the device describe how to remove the coverings or tabs and the best method of placement of the adhesive side of the  device on the skin) (to enhance staff efficiency).<BR>2.	IV Securement device instructions for removal of the device from the skin are clear. (The methods of peeling back or rolling edges of device from the skin are described. The use of any solution on t he skin, for example 70% isopropyl alcohol or a proprietary adhesive remover, is stated) (to protect the patient).<BR>3.	IV Securement device holds intravenous catheter securely in place. (Intravenous catheter does not slip back and forth or side to side a fter being secured with device) (to protect the patient)<BR>4.	IV Securement device does not irritate patient skin. (No evidence of redness or blistering or puffiness of skin area.  No evidence of rash. No patient complaints of itching, burning or change i n skin sensation at the site) (to protect the patient)<BR><BR>Phase III  Pricing Analysis Process.  <BR>After the clinical/performance evaluation is completed and analyzed will be contacted to submit their lowest pricing quotes (as well as product cross-r eference data) based on committed volume of 80% of the total Regional requirement. Vendors will be provided seven calendar days to submit their price quotes in a prescribed format via email. Price quotes must be received by 5:00 p.m. HST on the seventh calendar day. Failure to respond within this timeframe or failure to submit incentive discounts from their DAPA prices will result in the vendor being disqualified  from further consideration/ participation. The Region intends to evaluate quotes and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions as noted above. However, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if determined  to be necessary. <BR><BR>Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important. Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a 2-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years). The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis: (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Regio n (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor. Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Re gion is considered more important than other pricing elements.  <BR><BR>

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) intends to issue a solicitation in support of the World Trade Center disaster responders. 

Since September 11, 2001, the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), CDC, and NIOSH have been active in assessing the health impact of the World Trade Center disaster. There is currently a program in place to provide periodic health assessment examinations, diagnosis, and treatment to the responders in the New York City (NYC) area. CDC intends to award a one year contract to provide comparable services to those responders outside of the NYC area. As the program grows in the next year, the number of responders outside of the NYC area could increase to 6,000 members from its current level of approximately 4,000 members.

There is an urgent need for these services, so CDC/NIOSH is requesting qualification and capability statements from companies to perform the following functions:

1.	Provide initial and annual health assessment examinations to WTC Responders on a nationwide basis. 

2.	Provide diagnosis and focused treatment to WTC Responders on a nationwide basis for WTC-related conditions.

3.	Provide a pharmacy benefit to WTC Responders on a nationwide basis.

4.	Provide data to the NIOSH Responder Assistance and Benefits Office for tracking and reporting on member status.

5.	Develop and provide access to a database of member information that will be accessible via the internet and capable of updates by either the contractor or the NIOSH Responder Assistance and Benefits Office. 

6.	Provide patient encounter reporting on health assessment examinations and treatment to NIOSH for quality assurance.

7.	Provide comprehensive reports to NIOSH for tracking and assessing contract compliance.

Interested sources capable of providing the health care services as detailed above are requested to submit limited relevant information not exceeding 30 pages total on the following qualifications of the organization: (1) Experience: An outline of previous work specific to the requirements listed above; (2) Personnel: Name, professional qualifications and specific experience of those in key positions; and (3) Facilities: Availability and description of facilities and equipment required to provide the required services, including capabilities for electronic data entry and use of web-based encrypted systems. Any other specific and relevant information that would improve the government's consideration and evaluation of the information presented is desirable.

This request represents an unusual and compelling urgency from the Government.  The intent of the Government is to issue a solicitation directly to no more than 5 companies.  Companies intending to enter partnerships/teaming arrangements must do so at this time; only the prime should respond to this announcement.  The Government will review the full capabilities of each company that responds to this announcement plus other firms identified during market research.  The Government will down select to a maximum of 5 companies which present the most robust qualifications and capabilities.  For informational purposes only - QTC, Inc. is currently providing the monitoring of responders under a subcontract from Mt. Sinai; AOEC is providing treatment services under a grant from the American Red Cross.  

Your response to this notice shall include the organization's name, address, point of contact, National Provider Identifier (NPI) if available, and size of business (large, small, small women- owned, etc.). This notice does not commit the Government to any contractual agreement and does not represent a request for proposal. The Government does not intend to award a contract based on responses under this announcement nor otherwise pay for preparing any information sent or the Government's use of the information. Any proprietary information should be so marked. The requested information shall be submitted electronically in MS Word or PDF format only to (dstaudt@cdc.gov) the CDC Contracting Officer, David Staudt, by 1 p.m., Wednesday, April 2, 2008.  Based on the responses from this Sources Sought and NIOSH market research, CDC intends to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) to a maximum of 5 companies determined to be most qualified. 
Because of the urgent need for these services, the timeframe from issuance of the RFP to award of contract is expected to be less than 60 days.  It is anticipated that the solicitation will be issued on or about April 4th, 2008.

<DESC>A.	General Information

The Southwest & Pacific Regions, two of the three Regions that form the Logistical Support Area (LSA-West), a military integrated delivery network, comprised of Army, Navy, and Air Force medical treatment facilities in California, Guam, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea announce a Request for Regional Incentive Agreement Quotation (RFRIAQ) for the standardization of Safety Lancets.  The regions recognize vendors may manufacture and/or distribute subsets of the category.  A multiple selection is only a possibility if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Regions and would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.  In order to meet the total requirements of the Regions a vendor must be able to offer a comprehensive product line (all items within a product category) available in the necessary quantities to meet all of the DoD MTFs? needs. That is, the required products must be available in the required quantities. As stated previously, it is not the preference of this standardization to make a multiple selection, however, if necessary due to non-availability from a single source, a multiple selection would be made based on a combination of Regional Clinical preference as determined by the Clinical Product Team (CPT) and vendor product availability. The product category includes finger and heel lancets with a safety feature to prevent a needlestick injury and subsequent exposure to blood borne pathogens.

The primary objective of this standardization initiative is to achieve a best value determination that represents the clinically preferred product or source at the best possible price.  It is also intended that standardized product be obtained through the DoD Prime Vendor Program. 

The secondary objective of this standardization initiative is the potential of decreasing the existing Stock Keeping Unit?s (SKUs) and thus dollars held as inventory.  The below item detail of the products being purchased within the region will be used to target and cross-match product lists submitted by the vendor. This process will ensure the minimum requirements of the Region are met and help identify possible candidates (i.e. like product items) for elimination, as well as potentially minimizing the number of SKUs included in a subsequent incentive agreement.

The major facilities in these Regions include but are not limited to Naval Medical Center San Diego; David Grant Medical Center, Travis AFB; Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton; Robert E. Bush Hospital, Twenty-Nine Palms; Weed Army Community Hospital, Ft. Irwin; Naval Hospital Lemoore; 9th Medical Group, Beale AFB; 30th Medical Group, Vandenberg AFB; 61st Medical Squadron, Los Angeles AFB; 95th Medical Group, Edwards AFB, Tripler Army Medical Center, U.S. Naval Hospital Okinawa, U.S. Naval Hospital Guam, U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka, 121st Combat Support Hospital Seoul, 374th Medical Group, Yokota AB, and 18th Medical Group Kadena AB.   

This standardization action is part of the Medical/Surgical Prime Vendor program executed by the Defense Supply Center Philadelphia, Directorate of Medical Materiel.  In order to participate, your company must have a Distribution and Pricing Agreement (DAPA) and a separate commercial agreement with the Prime Vendor of the program.  This is pursuant to the DAPA clause by which DAPA holders agree to the Standardization process and to allow Prime Vendors to distribute their items. This is a supplement to the Prime Vendor Program and it is not a contract.  For additional information regarding DSCP?s Prime vendor program please access our web site at:  https://dmmonline.dscp.dla.mil.

The Tri-Service Regional Business Office (TRBO) will provide anticipated volume (quantity) based on historical usage/forecasted requirements.  The agreement will be for a base period of two (2) years (24 months) from date of award with three (3) 12-month option periods.  Anticipated award date is June 2008.  The evaluation will be based on technical, clinical and pricing factors.  The Technical/Company and Clinical/Performance evaluation factors, when combined, are considered significantly more important than cost or price.  As the technical and clinical evaluation results become more equal, price will become more important.   The selection will be determined utilizing best value/trade off criteria.  The selection of a single vendor is anticipated.  However, if no single vendor can meet the total requirement of the Region, the Government reserves the right to make two or more selections for RIAs.  In this event, selection would be based on a combination of MTF preference and product availability.

B.	Products & Performance Required

The Southwest and Pacific Regions are seeking product line items in the category of Safety Lancets. The product category includes finger and heel lancets with a safety feature to prevent a needlestick injury and subsequent exposure to blood borne pathogens.  Within these 2 Regions, this product line has an estimated annual dollar requirement of $174,200.  This forecast is based on historical prime vendor sales during a recent 12-month period.  

At the request of the Southwest & Pacific Regions Military Treatment Facilities vendors will provide on-site support and in-servicing, educational resources and tools for clinical use of the product, conversion information, prime vendor order numbers, MSDS information, and itemization of the brands, types and packaging information of the products offered by the vendor.

Vendors may be asked to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to Southwest Region test sites and to Tripler Army Medical Center. This option is used to support the government?s minimum need and is normal and customary. All vendors will be required to provide training materials to US Army Health Clinic Schofield Barracks, NH Guam, NH Okinawa, and NH Yokosuka Barracks and Southwest Region test sites. These training aides will address the safe and acceptable method of using the device. The training/guidance materials may be in the form of a DVD, product literature or other instructional methods that the vendor believes will assist the clinician. These training items must arrive prior to the clinical evaluation period. Failure to provide training/instructional materials will result in exclusion from the standardization process. 

C.	Instructions to Vendors

If you are interested in participating in this standardization initiative, email your (1) Company name and address, (2) POC (Name and Phone Number, Fax Number, E-mail address, your answers to the technical questions/criteria below and product literature electronically to cynthia.ingrao@med.navy.mil no later than April 9, 2008.  All e-mail communications between vendors and the region will be digitally signed.  Submissions must be received by 4:00 PM EST on the specified closing date/time of this sources sought notice.  Vendors that fail to meet the submittal deadline will be disqualified.  If your product literature is more than 4MB in size, please mail your product literature to:

Phone: (808)433-7985

This process will include vendor requirements of electronic responses to technical criteria, no charge samples for clinical evaluation, and submission of electronic best price offers.  Due to the potential for email to become lost in transmission due to network security, etc., the vendor is strongly encouraged to confirm with the Region that its quote and literature actually arrived at the Region via email.  We strongly recommend that each submitting vendor confirm receipt, allowing enough time for re-submission before the due date, if a problem should occur with the first transmission.

D.	 Evaluation Criteria

The Tri-Service Product Review Board (TPRB) is the governing board of the standardization process. This board includes clinicians and logisticians from all of the Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) within the Southwest and Pacific Regions. They are the decision makers for this initiative.

Phase I - Technical/Company Evaluation Process
Vendors will be required to provide responses to the technical/company criteria. Amplifying information about your products may be requested by the Government.  The responses will be reviewed under the purview of the TPRB to determine acceptability. All technical/company criteria are weighted equally. After review of the technical/company criteria, those vendors who meet these criteria will be invited to participate in the clinical/performance evaluation.

The TPRB will review the responses from the vendors and determine which vendors meet the criteria and determine acceptability.  Acceptability for purposes of evaluation of technical/company criteria: Generally, responses to all questions in this section demonstrate:  (1) the vendor is a distributor or manufacturer of a complete line of the subject medical/surgical consumables; (2) based on the vendor?s responses, the evaluators have reasonable confidence that the line or products and/or services submitted meet the medical standards of care of the community, applicable to such products or services; (3) the vendor has, or is obtaining a DAPA for the items (vendors that fail to have a DAPA will be disqualified); (4) the vendor has, or is obtaining, an agreement covering the items, with Cardinal, the Prime Vendor for the region (vendors whose products are not available through the regional PV will be disqualified); (5) the vendor intends to provide discounts off DAPA for all products included in this standardization initiative (vendors that fail to provide a discount from DAPA will be disqualified); and (6) the vendor?s information provided is factually correct.  Any misrepresentation of information will disqualify the vendor from further consideration.

Technical/Company Criteria
1.	Vendors must provide Safety Lancets for adult, pediatric and neonatal patients for fingers and/or heels with a safety feature to prevent a needlestick injury and subsequent exposure to blood borne pathogens.   Vendors must provide a list of the products they supply in this product line and the brand name to include the type, material used, size and how the sizes identified.  A complete line of product' is defines as the MTF's requirements for usage items in the product line.  Usage items are defined in the Medical/surgical Prime Vendor contract statement of work, as DAPA items ordered at least once per month, and at least one unit per order.
2.	Vendors must have a separate agreement with the Prime Vendor supporting our Region, Cardinal Health or will be disqualified.
3.	Vendors must have a DAPA number or is in the process of obtaining a DAPA or will be disqualified.
4.	Your product line must be latex free and this must be indicated on the packaging of the product.
5.	Your products must be single use and disposable.
6.	Your products must be sterile.
7.	Your products must have a safety feature that is an integral part of the device and not an accessory.
8.	The safety feature of the device must require the user?s hands to remain behind the sharp at all times.
9.	The safety feature must be activated passively and not be able to be reactivated.
10.	Activation of the safety feature must not create any noise that may startle the patient or user.
11.	Vendors must provide product literature for this product line.
12.	Vendors must provide 24/7 customer support and identify company resources for such support with their initial submittals.
13.	Vendors must submit prices lower than their DAPA or will be disqualified. Where lower FSS prices are available, DAPA holders are required by previous agreement to provide the FSS price as their DAPA price.  Therefore, FSS prices do not represent a discount off the DAPA.
14.	Your products must meet the FDA requirements for medical devices.
15.	Vendors must provide electronic and hard copy proposed pricing and a competitive product cross-reference in electronic excel format upon request.
16.	Vendors must provide any history of back orders and/or recalls/alerts that occurred during the most recent 24-month period for Safety Lancets including dates, duration, cause, and resolution with their initial submittals.  This represents your sole opportunity to present this information. Provide any mitigating factors that you may have in order to provide a proper context for the cited back orders, recalls, etc.
17.	Vendors may be asked to provide on-site, in-person in-servicing to Southwest Region test sites.
18.	Vendor is required to provide product literature, training aids, and teaching materials prior to the clinical evaluation to the Pacific Region and Southwest Region test sites. Vendors, who cannot provide product literature, training aids, and teaching materials to these MTFs, prior to the clinical evaluations, will be disqualified.

Phase II - Clinical/Performance Evaluation Process
The TPRB will request samples from the product group to be clinically evaluated at selected Military Treatment Facilities. Vendors are required to ship samples directly to the designated MTFs.  Vendors will be given 21 calendar days to receive samples.  Samples must arrive at the MTF by COB, 4PM local time, on the 21st calendar day after the notice to ship. Vendors failing to deliver by the deadline will be disqualified from further consideration in the standardization process (all vendors must send TRBO verification regarding date of shipment).

The MTFs will evaluate the clinical/performance criteria using a scale from one (1) to five (5) where 1 = Not Acceptable, 2 = Minimally Acceptable, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Acceptable, and 5 = Highly Acceptable.  All clinical/performance criteria are weighted equally. The Government reserves the right to conduct evaluations in either a non-clinical or clinical setting or both. The CPT has established a target threshold of 3.0 for clinical acceptability of product for standardization. The CPT will analyze acceptability as being at or near 3.0 depending on the ?break?, in the average scores and how closely the scores are clustered near the Acceptability Target Threshold of 3.0. Subject to this review, products below this threshold will be clinically unacceptable and be disqualified from further consideration for standardization.

A Clinical Product Team (CPT) comprised of medical professionals from several disciplines will evaluate the products based upon on the following evaluation criteria to determine acceptability.

Clinical/Performance Criteria Evaluation
1.	The safety feature activates passively and creates minimal noise that may startle the patient or end user.
2.	The safety feature can?t be activated unless the user?s hands remain behind the sharp device at all times to prevent a needlestick injury.
3.	The safety device is easily used with either hand so left and right-handed users can use the device as intended.
4.	Activation of the safety feature is obvious to the end user so activation is insured before disposal.
5.	The safety feature cannot be activated more than once and remains in effect after disposal to prevent a needlestick injury.
6.	The device cannot be reused once the safety feature is activated to prevent a needlestick injury.
7.	The device can be easily and exactly placed on the desired puncture site (heel or finger) to avoid unnecessary multiple punctures and distress to the patient.
8.	The device allows for an adequate blood volume to be drawn with one puncture because multiple punctures will distress the patient.
9.	The safety device minimizes the risk of blood exposure because it withdraws the sharp end away from the user.
10.	The device is simple and easy to use and requires little training so anyone can use it effectively.
11.	The size and type of the device is easily identified from the packaging to avoid opening the package unnecessarily.

Phase III ? Pricing Analysis Process
All vendors who provide samples for clinical evaluation will be asked to submit best value pricing for analysis. Vendors will be given 14 calendar days from the date of request to submit their best pricing, in a prescribed format, based upon the total requirements of the Southwest Region.  Failure to respond within the timeframe will result in disqualification. 
The Region intends to evaluate pricing and select a vendor or vendor(s), without discussions.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best product matches for the products or product lines requested in this announcement.  Vendor pricing should contain the vendor's best tiered-pricing discounts off of the vendor's DAPA pricing (based on committed volume of 80% of the total requirements of the MTFs in the Region).  Additionally, the Region reserves the right to conduct discussions and request revised pricing, if it is determined to be necessary.  Pricing will be evaluated based on best value to the government and will be based on a committed volume for a two-year period with possible one-year option periods (not to exceed 5 years).  The following elements will be considered in the pricing analysis:  (1) Impact of RIA prices on the Region (Post-Standardization Costs), (2) Potential Cost Avoidance, (3) Impact of Unmatched Lines, and (4) Consideration of stockage keeping units (SKUs) by each vendor.  Due to the potential for Base DAPA prices to be inflated, the Impact of RIA prices on the Region is considered more important than other pricing elements.  Clinical/performance and technical/company factors will be weighted more heavily than price. As the evaluation results become more technically equal, price will become more important. Vendors who fail to offer discounted prices will be excluded from RIA award consideration.

<DESC>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is seeking a small business with the ability to serve as a Coordinating Center (CC) for a new four-year multi-center clinical research study entitled Myocardial Infarction NITrite Therapy in MAN trial (MINITT MAN).  The applicable NAICS code is 541712 and the size standard is 500 employees. 

The proposed study is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase IIa and IIb clinical trial designed to evaluate the effects of sodium nitrite administration on infarct size and left ventricular remodeling in subjects with large anterior myocardial infarctions who undergo primary coronary angioplasty.  Eligible subjects who present to the hospital with an acute anterior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and who agree to participate in this study will be randomized to receive a single 10-minute infusion of study medication consisting of either nitrite or placebo.  The size of the infarction and the dimensions of the heart will be assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography (ECG) within 48 hours to seven days of the infusion of the study medication, and then again four months later. Participants will be recruited over a two year period and be followed for six months. The CC will be responsible for coordinating all aspects of the research and for managing and analyzing the acquired data. 

One award is anticipated under a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The CC will be responsible for subcontracting with clinics that can adequately recruit, randomize and follow participants according to the study protocol.  Patient recruitment may involve international clinics from locations such as Canada and Western Europe.  The CC will also subcontract for a Central Laboratory (for blood collection, processing, and analysis), a Central Pharmacy, and reading center(s) for MRI, electrocardiograph (ECG), echocardiograph (ECHO), and Holter exams.  The CC will have a key role in study design, oversight and monitoring, data collection, data integrity, and reporting.  The CC will also be responsible for reproduction and dissemination of protocols, manuals, and forms.  The CC will be responsible for maintaining confidentiality of data and for monitoring development of informed consent forms.  Furthermore, the CC will be responsible for coordinating communications and organizing meetings of study committees, as needed.

Small business concerns that believe they possess the capabilities necessary to undertake this study should submit documentation of their capabilities to the Contracting Officer.     The capability statement should identify:  1) the total number of employees, 2) the professional qualifications of scientific and technical personnel, 3) general and specific facilities and equipment available, including computer equipment and software, 4) previous research projects in which the small business organization and the proposed personnel have participated, and 5) the experience the organization and proposed personnel have in working with and coordinating activities involving international sites, and any other information relevant to this program.  The capability statement must not exceed 10 single sided or 5 double sided pages in length. 

Interested small business organizations are required to identify their size standards in accordance with the Small Business Administration.  The government requests that no proprietary or confidential business data be submitted in a response to this notice.  However, responses that indicate the information therein is proprietary will be properly safeguarded for Government use only.  Capability statements must include the name and telephone numbers of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with Government representatives.  Capability statements in response to this market survey that do not provide sufficient information for evaluation will not be considered. When submitting this information, please reference the solicitation notice number.  Responses received after the due date may not be reviewed.

This is NOT a RFP, and responses should not include budgetary information.  Additionally, the Government is not committed to award a contract pursuant to this announcement.  If this program is approved for implementation and it is determined to be a small business set aside, then a competitive RFP will be set aside for small business concerns and will be available in FedBizOpps.  The RFP release date is pending.  The Government intends to negotiate one (1) cost-reimbursement contract for a period of four years with an approximate award date of March 31, 2009.

<DESC>Quality Assurance Oversight of Managed Care Organizations
Performed by 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
and its Agents


THIS IS NOT A FORMAL REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL (RFP) AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE.

This is a SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE to determine the availability of potential small businesses on the GSA MOBIS Schedule (e.g., 8(a), service-disabled veteran owned small business, HUBZone small business, small disadvantaged business, veteran-owned small business, and women-owned small business) that can provide assistance in the review of completed routine and focused program compliance audits of CMS participating Managed Care Organizations..  

History:  In December 2003, the President signed the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA).  MMA expanded the role of private plans in providing benefits to Medicare beneficiaries. The law added a new section to the Social Security Act; 1860D (Part D) that offered prescription benefits beginning in 2006 through Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs). Secondly, the statute allowed for payments to MA,local plans, (formerly Medicare Plus Choice (M+C) plans) and created a new type of private plan, regional, MA plans (RPPOs).  The Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) became a permanent program under the Balanced Budget Act of 1999 (PubLNo 105-33) and a state option for the Medicaid program.  PACE was created to help community-based organizations provide health and long-term care services on a capitated basis to frail elderly persons at risk of being institutionalized.  

Oversight of Managed Care Organizations

CMS is responsible for providing oversight of its participating Managed Care Organizations (MAOs).  CMS's oversight of MAOs is a monitoring control designed to ensure MAOs are in compliance with regulations established within applicable Medicare law, and therefore eligible to participate in the Managed Care program.  

CMS developed a risk-based approach for their oversight of the Managed Care organizations. The risk-based approach was used to identify which plans would be selected for review in the annual audit strategy and to determine what organizational eligibility elements would be audited.

CMS has ten Regional Offices that perform the program compliance audits. Upon the completion of the audit, CMS management is required to communicate noncompliances identified to the organizations which are then required to submit corrective action plans. CMS Management is required to evaluate the corrective action plans in order to make a final determination of each plan's eligibility.

CMS has the responsibility to:  (i) ensure program compliance audit findings, corrective action plans, and acceptance of the provider's corrective action plans are provided, reviewed, and released within the proposed time frames, and (ii) ensure that relevant data are updated timely in order to provide the information necessary for adequate management oversight.

Oversight Tracking

The Health Plan Management System (HPMS) is used by CMS to monitor the execution and status of managed care organization oversight. This system lies at the core of CMS's management process for MAOs.  The Monitoring Review Module in HPMS enables management to monitor the MAOs by tracking the progress of the program compliance audits.  Results are updated, including exceptions, corrective action plans, and CMS's acceptance of CAPS from MAO's.

Purpose

CMS is seeking the services of a contractor to provide quality assurance of the MAO program compliance audits.  The contractor's focus is to ensure that strong program oversight controls remain in place and are adhered to so that Medicare program stakeholders maintain confidence that CMS properly oversees the programs it administers. 

Routine audits serve as one of the primary mechanisms that CMS uses for ensuring and documenting compliance with Medicare program requirements.  Audits are necessary to identify irregularities, validate self-reported data, and to ensure the Agency is managing Medicare programs effectively.

CMS? oversight strategy is to identify program vulnerabilities and ensure sponsors? strict adherence to regulatory requirements.  This strategy focuses the Agency's oversight efforts on auditing Part C and D MAO's and PACE providers, and program attributes that the program business owners identify as representing the utmost harm to beneficiaries and CMS.  Regularly scheduled routine and focused program compliance audits are necessary for ensuring sponsor compliance and for documenting the Agency?s program oversight activities.  

Task Descriptions:  The tasks under this contract shall focus on the management, performance and quality of the Program compliance audits performed by CMS.  The audits are performed according to the CMS 2008 Audit Strategy Paper (or the most current version).  MAOs are selected and audited in a consistent manner and according to the appropriate 2008 Audit Process paper (2008-AP) and 2008 RO Audit Workload List spreadsheet (2008 RO-AWL).  The Audit Populations includes all Medicare Advantage Only (MA), Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans (MA-PD), Prescription Drug Plans (PDP), Regional Preferred Provider Plans (RPPO), and Program of All Inclusive Care of the Elderly (PACE). 

CMS plans to conduct approximately 84 program compliance audits as outlined in the 2008 RO-AWL, and to include all the elements of the chapters as outlined in the 2008-AP paper. The contractor shall ensure the audits are performed timely and according to CMS Standard Operating Procedures and Audit Guides.  The tasks will include the following:

1.	Ensure that existing policies and procedures for the monitoring of organizations within the Managed Care program are consistently applied and that the monitoring of these organizations is documented in accordance with appropriate standards and guidelines.
2.	Perform quality assurance on the program compliance audits performed by the Regional Office staff and the auditor assistance contractor to ensure developed detailed policies and procedures outlining the minimum documentation requirements that must be maintained as part of the program compliance audits appropriately support the audit outcome.
3.	Report to CMS on compliance with regulations for the monitoring of specific chapters and/or elements for organizations. For example, PACE organizations are required to be monitored every year for the first three years of acceptance into the program, and every other year thereafter.
4.	Ensure findings, corrective action plans, and acceptance of the provider's correction action plans are provided, reviewed, and released within the proposed time frames. 
5.	Ensure that relevant data are updated timely within HPMS in order to provide the information necessary for adequate management oversight.
6.	Validate completeness of audit files in accordance with document retention standards, the audit checklist, and the model audit file.    
7.	Provide CMS management with detailed information reports that summarize relevant findings and results from the reviews of the compliance documentation. 

Contractor Requirements:  

PLEASE NOTE:  Any potential offeror must discuss the ability to provide the following:

1.	Specified knowledge and experience working with and understanding the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement Act of 2003.

2.	Current knowledge with the Health Plan Management System (HPMS) and those modules related to the Program compliance audits.  If prior experience of the HPMS is not possessed, then the contractor shall possess experience using large benefit data bases to examine and manipulate data and issue reports to management. 

3.	Experience with developing quality assurance programs in tracking and monitoring the completed compliance audits and ensure they are performed according to the current Audit Strategy and schedule.   Perform validation of tests completed and other audit procedures.  
4.	Experience in preparing and giving technical presentations before small and large audiences.

<DESC>Contracting Office Address: Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD), Division of Procurement, 200 Third Street, Avery 5F, Parkersburg WV, 26101.

Description: This is a sources sought notice and not a request for quotations.     The purpose of this announcement is to determine potential qualified SDVOSB, HubZone, SDB, MBE or other Small Businesses who can furnish and deliver the services listed below.    

The government requires detailed information regarding the most commonly diverted drugs. Specifically, a detailed, comprehensive characterization of prescription drug diversion is needed. This project will achieve that goal by determining whether the methods by which prescription drugs are purchased conform to distinct patterns and whether those patterns are indicative of suspicious behavior. Examples of suspicious acquisition patterns that the project will examine include disproportionate numbers of cash-based purchases or the filling of multiple prescriptions for the same drug in an unusually short period of time. Identification and analysis of behaviors such as these will then be used to develop a complete profile of prescription drug diversion. 

The government also requires an assessment of the magnitude of prescription drug diversion. Having first identified the methods of acquisition associated with commonly diverted prescription drugs (as detailed above), this project will estimate the proportion of prescription drugs that are likely diverted from the legitimate market either for illicit resale or abuse.

Finally, the need exists for an evaluation of the impact and effectiveness of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. The present project will analyze prescription drug acquisition patterns and trends throughout the United States and will develop estimates of prescription drug diversion in each of the 50 U.S. states. Those estimates of diversion will then be used to determine whether a correlation exists between the presence or absence of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and the estimated diversion in each state.

The contract term is estimated to be no more than 9 months; however, a speedier completion date for reports and briefing on findings is desirable. The Contractor shall prepare a report on the results of the project (including all necessary background information on the objectives, scope, and methodology of the project).
*	The report shall comprise three parts: an executive summary, the body of the report and a technical appendix comprising all statistical details. (The technical appendix shall document all the algorithms, methods and assumptions used to assess prescription drug diversion such that an independent researcher can replicate the results.)
*	The report shall be a stand-alone reference document, useable by drug researchers, practitioners and policy makers.
*	The report shall be properly formatted in Microsoft Word.
*	The report shall include a table of contents.
*	The report shall include graphics, figures and tables as necessary.
*	The body of the report shall include three major sections as follow: analysis of acquisition patterns of prescription drugs, assessment of the magnitude of prescription drug diversion and evaluation of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs.


Responses: Responses shall include Company Name, socio economic category (SDVOSB, HUBZone, SDB, MBE or small business) DUNS #, address, telephone number, point of contact, email address and brief capabilities statement.

Responses shall also detail if the vendor currently has the data necessary to complete the report and explain how and when the data was obtained and why. Vendors shall demonstrate that the data they can access represents a significant portion of the available prescription data (the degree of data completeness).

If the vendor does not currently have the data, how would the data be obtained and how quickly will it be obtained?

Is 9 months a reasonable amount of time to complete the study and create reports? If not, vendors should propose their definition of a reasonable, but speedy, timeline to provide final reports and briefings.

Vendors shall provide a list of similar reports/studies generated by their company. The list shall include the name and date of the report/study and a contact name and address for the recipient of each report/study.

Responses to this announcement shall be sent to:  Lisa Gossett, Contract Specialist, Phone 304-480-7213, Fax (304) 480-7204, Email psb3@bpd.treas.gov by 9:00 a.m., Eastern time March 31, 2008.

<DESC>The US Court of International Trade (CIT) has a cat-6 infrastructure that supports a voice, and data network system. There presently exists a separate video teleconferencing system. While the CIT intends to upgrade this video conferencing system, it would prefer to utilize the existing infrastructure if possible. Interested parties shall respond by email to the above points of contact.  Responses must include the following:


	List by category the model, condition, any special features, and quantity of components the respondent can offer.  
	Evaluation of existing cabling infrastructure to determine re-usability, certification and warrant ability.
	Demonstrate how the new system will integrate with existing voice and data cabling system by utilizing spare ports in existing patch panels.

Include a description of the services provided, the period of performance, the contract number, the name, phone number, address and e-mail of the contracting officer and technical representative.  Verify that your company is registered in the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) and provide your cage code number.


	The Government will evaluate the information provided, use it to document our market research and develop the RFP.  In addition, the Government will use its evaluation of the information and other research to determine the sources that appear qualified to perform the work and assure the level of safety required by the Government. The Government intends to release the RFP only to those respondents who are deemed qualified for this requirement based on their initial response.  
The Government currently anticipates a single award to the source that provides the best value by offering the broadest capability of Video Teleconferencing infrastructure suited to the CITs requirements while performing strict quality control procedures to ensure the pricing will be firm fixed.

<CONTACT>Karen Sacco, 732 427 1425
<DESC><BR>INTRODUCTION/DESCRIPTION:<BR><BR>The US Army is seeking sources and information to perform sustainment support for LCMR systems.  LCMR systems are fielded in theater supporting Operation Iraq Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) operation s.  The LCMR system shall have a 91% probability that 1 of 2 systems operate failure-free over a 72 hour mission pulse.  Rationale: The LCMR is a low density system and must maintain continuous operations with minimal down time. The LCMR system shall have a 95% average operational availability (Ao).  Rationale: The LCMR is a low density system and must maintain continuous operations with minimal down time.  The LCMR system operators shall perform 80% of all unscheduled maintenance.   Rationale:  Key to maxi mizing the system availability and increasing self-sufficiency.  The LCMR system shall have a field and sustainment maintenance ratio not to exceed 0.05 maintenance man hours per operating hour.  Rationale:  Ensures that the radar is maintained within the maintenance force structure constraints.  The LCMR system Maximum Time to Repair at Field Level will not exceed 30 minutes for 90% of the maintenance tasks performed at this maintenance level.  Rationale:  The LCMR is a low density system and must maintain  continuous operations with minimal down time.  Integrated Logistics Support (ILS) may include, but not necessarily be limited to: material and facilities, as well as services, in the following areas:  (1) supply & distribution; spares and repair parts (2)  maintenance; (3) training; (4) software support; (5) rebuild/overhaul; (6) repair (CONUS & OCONUS); (7) repair and return (if the unit cannot be repaired OCONUS); (8) modifications/upgrades/updates to hardware/software/firmware and (9) system support.  LC MR maintenance and support will be composed of a mix of Government Logistics Assistance Representatives (LARs) and Contractor Field Service Engineers (FSEs) located at C4ISR Regional Support Centers (RSCs).  The C4ISR RSCs provide direct and integrated gen eral support as well as some limited depot support for other systems in OIF/OEF.  It serves as a centralized single face to the field for a broad range of engineering, management, logistics and technical services.  Although the Government will provide thes e RSC facilities, the Contractor may be required to travel to remote and hostile areas.  Contractor-provided FSEs shall be co-located and integrated in theater at one or more RSC location (subject to change) in Iraq or Afghanistan.<BR><BR>A 2-level mainten ance concept at the operational unit (Field) and Echelon Above Unit (EAU) (Depot) levels and ILS CONUS and OCONUS will be implemented.  This shall include, but not necessarily be limited to:  on-site and off-site repairs, 24/7 on call services when a syste m is returned from the field to include maintenance, product support, shipping, training, documentation and manual updates to the LCMR program.  Any resultant contract will include the requirement to: provide technical support for damaged systems returned from the field, which shall include, but not be limited to, troubleshooting, repairs and test of failed systems; provide depot level support to include repair parts/field maintenance kits for all LCMR systems; provide FSEs for technical support of the syst em in the field, which shall include, but not be limited to, troubleshooting, repairs and test of failed systems, and operator guidance and training; provide updated electronic technical documentation sufficient for soldiers to operate, maintain and train on the equipment in forward areas of the battlefield; document and implement a components and materials obsolescence program and monitor and evaluate electronic part life cycle status and availability on the system design throughout the duration of the con tract; provide training and documentation necessary for both Contractor and Government to be able to perform in-theater maintenance above unit level and conduct  unit and Government LAR training in theater.  Ease of supportability in the field environment is paramount. A wartime operational readiness supportability rate of 99.5% is a requirement.  Repair parts and personnel required to maintain stock levels to mee t this readiness requirement is a critical element of any future requirement.  When field failures occur and the Contractor FSE or Government LAR determines that the LCMR cannot be repaired in country, the established turnaround time for CONUS repair is a maximum of thirty (30) days once received at the Contractor CONUS depot to the time the repaired unit is received at the designated CONUS acceptance point.  The established turnaround time for OCONUS repair, once an evaluation indicates an item can be repa ired within country, is twenty-four (24) hours with the item being repaired and returned to the LAR.  Records shall be maintained of all repair/replacement actions detailing inventory of all equipment, returned equipment by name, part number and serial num ber, maintenance actions underway, repairs completed, labor hours and categories expended for repairs and repair price/cost of repairs, repair/replacement action taken, why a repair or replacement decision was made, date each item was received for repair, and whether the item is covered by warranty and the date/time repaired or replaced item was shipped back to the Government.  The Contractor awarded any resultant contract shall develop Performance Based Logistics (PBL) metrics by establishing a baseline fo r the LCMRs logistics footprint.  All collection of data shall be at the lowest level of detail and allow for visible cost drivers.  The Contractor awarded any resultant contract shall complete a Level of Repair Analysis (LORA) or an equivalent model and u tilize the results to support a Best Value Business Case Analysis which shall include the following metrics to be measured: A. The Logistics Response Time (LRT) for the LCMR System is defined as the period of time from a logistics demand signal sent to sat isfaction of that logistics demand. This requirement can be provided to the Government via a Technical Discrepancy Report.  B.  The Repair Cycle Time per System failure (the elapsed time from the receipt of a failure item at a repair facility until the tim e the item is repaired and ready for reissue to the user).  The contractor shall monitor and record the transportation time of a failed LCMR item as a metric and provide this information and any delays beyond the prescribed 96 Hour Turn-Around-Time to the Government.  C. The Stock Availability at Units forward supply level (time to fill a Line Replaceable Unit by the unit s forward supply support).  D.  Maintenance Driven Sub-Elements called Not Mission Capable Maintenance (NMCM) (time system is inoperable due to delay in obtaining maintenance resources.)  E.  The Contractor shall provide accurate data collection process of the Reliability, Availability, and Maintainability (RAM) system information, MANPRINT, spiral development by enhancing BIT/BITE requirem ents, sustainment training, and personnel.  The contractor shall use the transportation time to move parts as a metrics Packaging Handling Storage and Transportation.  Using an open architecture will aide and lower the footprint by modernization through te chnology insertion and sparing.  F. The contractor shall maintain and report LCMR System Life Cycle Sustainment Costs and achieve the optimized System Operational Availability (Ao).<BR><BR>Questions/Information Requested:  In providing your response to the  sustainment requirements portion of the announcement, please ensure you address the following as well as provide any additional data/information you feel necessary for the Government to assess the availability of suppliers for this level of service.  1.

<SUBJECT>R -- Intent to Award Sole Source Contract
<DESC>The African Development Foundation (ADF) intends to make a sole-source award for the acquisition of Country Program Coordinator (CPC) Services. These services will be required for approximately six months. The CPC is responsible for the oversight of the ADF program in the assigned country.  The CPC ensures that the ADF programs are well managed, and have significant, positive impacts on the enterprises, grassroots groups and communities being served.   The CPC liaises with government officials; non-governmental organizations, community groups and associations, and the business community to promote ADF?s locally led development approach and disseminate the lessons learned from projects funded by ADF.  The CPC is the principal contact point for ADF?s clients and applicants, development practitioners and the host country government.  The CPC monitors the implementation of projects funded by ADF and reviews, clears and reports on all deliverables submitted by clients.  ADF establishes a partnership arrangement with a local organization (Partner) with expertise in supporting small businesses and community development initiatives which provides general technical assistance to clients.  The CPC collaborates with the Partner to ensure high quality client service and effective implementation of the ADF country program.  

The Foundation currently has an urgent need to obtain these services for its program in Liberia.  Pursuant to  Section 506(a)(5) of the African Development Foundation Act (Act) and  48 CFR Chapter 57 ? African Development Foundation (Part 5706) Competition Requirements, Authority: 40 U.S.C. 474, Subpart 5706.3 ?  Other Than Full and Open Competition, ADF intends to make a sole-source award to James Addo. The Foundation is convinced that project identification and development consistent with the ADF?s statutory mandate and its program approval requirements would be substantially delayed in FY2008 if Mr. Addo were to depart or be replaced at this late juncture in the fiscal year.  In addition, because of his expertise and knowledge of the programs and his close monitoring of ADF-funded programs his absence would greatly increase the risk of inadequate oversight of or misuse of ADF funds.  Mr. Addo has been an essential participant in all of the Liberia country reentry negotiations and programming since 2006.  Mr. Addo?s unique knowledge of the program and contacts is seen as critical to the successful and timely completion of new and ongoing projects and to the success of the overall program. 

This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. ADF will respond to all written questions received no later than 5 days after publication of this notice.  Please email your questions to Ellen Teel, eteel@usadf.gov. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. No solicitation is available. Place of Performance: Washington, D.C with frequent extended travel to Liberia.

     This new approach to implement solutions and strategies for creating an integrated supply chain management system for strategic logistics will only be successful with meaningful collaboration with the private sector.  Companies are encouraged to attend this forum to share industry best practices, lessons learned, as well as information on their best processes that may be valuable in helping FEMA and GSA implement this strategy.
      The focus of the forum will be a dialogue to identify gaps, duplications, omissions, and challenges that adversely impact emergency response operations.  Companies interested in contracting opportunities with FEMA and GSA can access the Federal Business Opportunities website at www.fbo.gov  Registration:  Attendees are encouraged to RSVP no later than Tuesday, March 25th by sending an email to Natasha Rountree, Office of Acquisition Management, at natasha.rountree@dhs.gov with the following information:

Yearly subscription renewal for 335 VIKING cell phone devices is $49,915.00 at a subscription price of $149.00 per device. Yearly subscription renewal for 62 O2 cell phone devices is $6,138.00 at a subscription price of $99.0 per device. The yearly airtime charges for 397 (VIKING & O2) cell phone devices, is estimated at $3,970.00 for a subscription price of $10.00 per device. Annual Service and Maintenance Agreement for 397 devices is $15,000.00.  3.	A description of the supplies or services required to meet the agencyýs needs (including the estimated value).  The International Simulcast Recall Program uses cell phones to notify IPCýs at post of high precedence messages received by the MSMC and BMC Relays. 4.	Identification of the justification rationale (see 8.405-6(a) and (b)) and, if applicable, a demonstration of the proposed contractorýs unique qualifications to provide the required supply or service.  Statutory authority 41 USC 253(c)(1), FAR 6.302-1.  Only two responsible sources and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements 5.	A determination by the ordering activity contracting officer that the order represents the best value consistent with 8.404(d). A demonstration that the proposed contractorýs unique qualifications or the nature of the acquisition requires use of the authority cited (for sole source acquisitions; also required for unusual and compelling urgency where more than one offer will not be solicited).   World Cell Inc. and Nextel are the only sources that currently maintain GSM contracts in countries worldwide that provide services for more than 250 posts.  World Cell Inc. also has carriers in Reykjavik, Iceland dedicated to providing SMS services to countries with GSM coverage worldwide.<BR><BR>6.	A description of the market research conducted among schedule holders and the results or a statement of the reason market research was not conducted. A description of efforts made to ensure that offers are solicited from as many potential sources as is practicable. The description should include whether a FedBizOps notice was or will be publicized, as required by FAR 5.2, and if not, which exception under FAR 5.202 applies (e.g., blanket waiver provided in DOSAR 605.202-70).  BMC conducted surveys at the start of this program before cell phone acquisitions and program software were acquired.  World Cell Inc. and Nextel were the only venders that acquired GSM coverage contracts overseas. We use Nextel and World Cell Inc. for this program.  Nextelýs GSM overseas coverage has fallen off over the past 5 years while World Cellýs coverage has increased. Our Nextel phones have been substituted with World Cell instruments where required. Other vendors do not meet our current requirements and would be financially unacceptable. 7.	Any other facts supporting the justification.  The requirements for this program are unique. The International Simulcast Recall System is comprised of a software driven simulcast command and control station with direct connection, through the cell phone vendors lease line/satellite gateway, to quad-band Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) cell phones with worldwide roaming capability. The software driven simulcast command and control stations are located at BMC and MSMC. Using menu driven software scripts, the station allows operations personnel to create a database containing various notification and recall scripts that can be used to issue immediate notifications to post communications personnel throughout the world instantaneously. Notification messages issued by the control station are sent through the vendors lease line/satellite gateway and activate cell phones assigned to the post communicator personnel. The cell phones receive calls/signals through two major international GSM wireless providers ý World Cell, and Nextel. These two providers were determined to be the best to effectively service the 250 posts being provisioned with the international simulcast recall capability. GSM is the worldwide standard communication with over 500 million subscribers. Approximately 70% of all subscribers in the world use GSM. GSM is in 162 countries with 423 providers, the largest wireless platform in the world. The GSM cell phone equipment, operates in the worldwide roaming frequency.  The products activated by leased line gateway service or satellite gateway with simulcast (send out multiple signals at the same time) capabilities, with text and numeric messaging. No other sources have expressed interest in writing or other wise for this acquisition.  Since its inception in 2002 the acquisition for this program have been limited (sole source) to World Cell and Nextel.<BR><BR>8.	A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers that led to the restricted consideration before any subsequent acquisition for the supplies or services is made.  Since no other venders meet the necessary requirements, actions by the agency to remove barriers to competition should not be necessary<BR><BR>

<DESC>This notice constitutes a combined synopsis and solicitation as no other solicitation document will be available.  The U.S. Department of Energyýýýs (DOE) Industrial Technologies Program has initiated a nationwide effort to help industrial facilities identify opportunities for saving energy, and thereby cut operating costs.  To achieve this objective, DOE is sponsoring Energy Savings Assessments (ESAs) in large U.S. industrial plants.  ESAs will be conducted by DOE ESA Experts during calendar year 2008/2009.  ESA Experts are individuals who have satisfied the DOE Specialist Qualification training program requirements, and thus have demonstrated - by passing an examination - that they are proficient in the use of one or more of the DOE industrial systems software tools including AirMaster+ (AM+), Fan System Assessment Tool (FSAT), Process Heating Assessment and Survey Tool (PHAST), Pumping Systems Assessment Tool (PSAT), or the Steam System Assessment Tool Suite (SSAT).  The primary objective of the ESA is to identify to the plant staff opportunities to improve the efficiency of their compressed air, fan, process heating, pumping, or steam systems.  ESAs will be conducted during calendar year 2008 and 2009 by DOE "Qualified Specialists" that are certified by DOE as ESA Experts and are listed on the DOE Qualified Bidders List for 2008 and 2009.  The purpose of the solicitation is to add new ESA Experts to update the existing DOE Qualified Bidders List.

Enclosure (1) to COMDTINST 4200.14

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.     It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as a Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forums Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.     Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s 
 

concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.     Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless 
contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude refilling of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103 (e).  Formal protest filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

POSITION DESCRIPTION

BACKGROUND

The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was created in 1994 as a distinct operating unit within USAID to help local partners advance peace and democracy in priority conflict-prone countries.  Seizing critical windows of opportunity, OTI works on the ground to provide fast, flexible, short-term assistance targeted at key transition needs.

Countries experiencing a significant political transition in the midst of a disaster or emerging from civil conflict have unique needs that cannot be fully addressed by traditional disaster relief.  Timely and effective assistance to promote and consolidate peaceful, democratic advances can make the difference between a successful or a failed transition. OTI assists in securing peace by aiding indigenous, mostly non-governmental, civil society and media organizations. OTI uses such mechanisms as support for re-integration of ex-combatants into civilian society; development of initiatives to promote national reconciliation; identification of quick-impact community self-help projects to meet urgent economic needs; and aid to independent media outlets and community-based organizations to help promote informed debate and broaden public participation.

To respond quickly and effectively and meet its program objectives and mandate OTI retains a group of high level professionals and experts under personal services contracts (PSCs).  These knowledgeable and skilled professionals make up the vast majority of the OTI work force and are at its forefront implementing and achieving the organization's programmatic goals and objectives.  

For more information about OTI and its country programs please see: http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/transition_initiatives/

INTRODUCTION

In August 2002, OTI began implementation of a program in Venezuela to provide assistance to maintain democratic stability and strengthen the country's fragile democratic institutions. The OTI Venezuela program operates out of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas and is part of a larger U.S. government effort to promote democratic stability in Venezuela. The program includes a flexible, small grants program which supports activities that promote peaceful resolution of the current political crisis through facilitating dialogue, public debate on key issues, support to democratic institutions, and the promotion of citizen participation and democratic leadership. The program also supports Venezuelan civil society organizations that work on a variety of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, health care and legislative and judicial system monitoring.

OBJECTIVE

The objective of hiring for this position is to support the OTI Country Representative - Venezuela.

9.  CORE FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY

This is a middle management position requiring excellent managerial and communication skills, an ability to perform in a complex and highly sensitive political environment, experience in policy formulation and negotiation at the highest levels (government and non-government organizations), and a strong interest in assisting countries in transition. The candidate must be mature, self-reliant, a team player, a problem-solver, and able to manage a diverse portfolio of grants. S/he should have extensive management experience (both project and personnel) and understand the basics of grantee and contractor/USAID relationships. S/he should be able to communicate effectively with grassroots organizations and their constituencies, national and local government officials, USG agencies, and clerics or other religious leaders. Since work may require continued changes in program direction and implementation, including frequent coordination, the individual will be someone who is highly flexible and willing to work under conditions of ongoing change.  

The successful candidate must also be willing and able to perform a wide range of administrative functions (budget preparation, financial management, records management, travel assistance, etc.) to help ensure programmatic success.

DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

* Travel extensively in low security areas of focus to monitor and assess political conditions, meet with potential grantees, and develop Political Transition Grants;

Brand Name Justification: 

The Chief Information Officer (CIO) Directorate has made a determination to standardize on state-of-the-art Dell personal computers (PCs) throughout the Bureau, in both the Washington, DC and Fort Worth TX facilities. Standardized Dell PCs utilize standardized subsystems and drivers that facilitate management both with regard to initial configuration, setup, and imaging, as well as subsequent network administrations via th Bureau's Microsoft System Management Server (SMS) system. The Bureau's previous policy to purchase multi-brand PCs did not provide for standardized administration and resulted in various brands and generic PCs that could not easily be modified, such as configuring additional memory or performing other system configuration changes. When these PCs could be modified, they oftentimes required different network interface cards, parts, drivers, etc., resulting in time consuming reconfiguration, security, inventory management, and software compatibility issues. 

The capability to respond to an Information Technology (IT) security threat, such as viruses, worms, etc., in an expeditious manner is of paramount importance. The use of standardized systems helps to ensure that responses can be administered quickly and comprehensively, giving the organization the best opportunity to mitigate the threat prior to damage, such as loss of data or system availability. 

Therefore, under the authority of the Clinger Cowen Act in establishing the Bureau's Information Technology (IT) Architectural infrastructure to ensure interoperability and compatibility throughout the enterprise, the CIO has determined that it is beneficial to standardize the Bureau's hardware and software to facilitate ease of administration, as well as to provide for enhanced asset management. 

Through market research and best value analysis, the CIO and the Contracting Officer have selected Dell PCs as the Bureau's standard PC based on Dell's consistent, high quality products, proven historical capability of meeting delivery quantities and timeframes, overall past performance in providing outstanding customer support, as well as an overall fair and reasonable price.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The purpose of this synopsis/solicitation is to inform the vendor community of Defense Information Systems Agency?s proposed contract actions. This is acquisition is unrestricted for business participation purposes.  This proposed contract action in pursuant to the authority FAR 6.302-1, 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. Any deviation from the specified brand name will result in compatibility challenges and operations and maintenance logistics support issues.  The solicitation/reference number is MPHA369 and is issued as a request for proposal (RFP).  The associated North American Industrial Classification Systems (NAICS) code for this procurement is 335911.  The small business size standard is 500 employees.  Offeror must be registered on the Contractor Central Registration (CCR).  This acquisition is firm-fixed-price for GNB/Exide batteries and chargers. The GNB/Exide brand is the standard at the Pacific Missile Range Facility(PMRF) and these batteries and battery charges are already in standard use at PMRF.  The unique characteristics of this battery is that the PMRF Missile range already use these batteries as back-up power and they require the same battery to interchange with the current batteries already in place. For instance if at one site the battery dies they can pull out another battery from another site and interchange them without damaging the equipment.  Without these specific types of battery and battery charges a loss of power will be detrimental to the telemetry data stream during a mission operation or a missile launch.  Any deviation from the specified brand name will result in compatibility challenges and operations and maintenance logistics support issues.  This in return will be detrimental to the National Security of the United States.  A power outage without redundant battery back-up power will cost PMRF a significant amount of funds to disengage the missile and reschedule the mission operation. Without this equipment, this could result in the compromise or loss of National Security and cause grave damage to the United States. 
       This is an all-or-none requirement.  Partial proposals will be deemed unresponsive and will not be evaluated.  This acquisition is firm-fixed-price and solicited on a limited Brand Name, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) or authorized/qualified reseller basis in accordance with FAR 6.302-1.  Configuration and compatibility issues justify the use of brand name.  Please provide new and not refurnished equipment. Shipping must be included in cost.  BASIS OF AWARD: The Government will award a purchase order to the contractor with the lowest price. Lowest Price Technically Acceptable. Please provide your most fair and reasonable open-market pricing. Volume discounts are encouraged and greatly appreciated.

As prescribed in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 42.15, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) evaluates contractor past performance on all contracts that exceed $100,000, and shares those evaluations with other Federal Government contract specialists and procurement officials. The FAR requires that the contractor be provided an opportunity to comment on past performance evaluations prior to each report closing. To fulfill this requirement, VA uses an online database, the Contractor Performance System (CPS), which is maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The CPS database information is shared with the Past Performance Information Retrieval System (PPIRS) database, which is available to all Federal agencies. You are required to register with the NIH CPS database at the following web address: CPS - https://cpscontractor.nih.gov. Further, your registered representative data, as well as any other information in your registration data, must be kept current. Performance evaluations entered into CPS by the contracting officer will be assigned to the contractor's registered representative for comment. Failure to comment and reassign the report back to the contracting officer, or to maintain current registration, will result in the Government's evaluation being entered in the database with a statement that you have failed to respond. Help in registering can be obtained by contacting CPS Support E-mail (cps-support-1@list.nih.gov) or by calling (301) 451-2771. Pursuant to FAR Clause 52.212-4, para (t), Central Contractor Registration (CCR), after initial registration, the contractor is required to update registration data as changes occur and must re-register annually to ensure all data remains current. Noncompliance with this requirement will preclude the exercising of any option periods that may be included herein and will be cause for termination of the contract at such time noncompliance is discovered. Refer to cited Clause for more details. You are required to register with the CCR database at the following web address: CCR - http://www.ccr.gov. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT YOU COMPLETE THESE REGISTRATIONS IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED FOR CONTRACT AWARD. AWARD CANNOT BE MADE TO A CONTRACTOR NOT REGISTERED IN BOTH OF THESE DATABASE SYSTEMS.

(a) Definitions. As used in this clause--

Long-term contract means a contract of more than five years in duration, including options. However, the term does not include contracts that exceed five years in duration because the period of performance has been extended for a cumulative period not to exceed six months under the clause at 52.217-8, Option to Extend Services, or other appropriate authority.

Small business concern means a concern, including its affiliates, that is independently owned and operated, not dominant in the field of operation in which it is bidding on Government contracts, and qualified as a small business under the criteria in 13 CFR part 121 and the size standard in paragraph (c) of this clause.

(b) If the Contractor represented that it was a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor shall rerepresent its size status according to paragraph (e) of this clause or, if applicable, paragraph (g) of this clause, upon the occurrence of any of the following:

(1) Within 30 days after execution of a novation agreement or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the novation agreement was executed prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(2) Within 30 days after a merger or acquisition that does not require a novation or within 30 days after modification of the contract to include this clause, if the merger or acquisition occurred prior to inclusion of this clause in the contract.

(3) For long-term contracts--

(i) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the end of the fifth year of the contract; and

(ii) Within 60 to 120 days prior to the exercise date specified in the contract for any option thereafter.

(c) The Contractor shall rerepresent its size status in accordance with the size standard in effect at the time of this rerepresentation that corresponds to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code assigned to this contract. The small business size standard corresponding to this NAICS code can be found at http://www.sba.gov/services/contractingopportunities/sizestandardstopics/.

(d) The small business size standard for a Contractor providing a product which it does not manufacture itself, for a contract other than a construction or service contract, is 500 employees.

(e) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this clause, the Contractor shall make the rerepresentation required by paragraph (b) of this clause by validating or updating all its representations in the Online Representations and Certifications Application and its data in the Central Contractor Registration, as necessary, to ensure they reflect current status. The Contractor shall notify the contracting office by e-mail, or otherwise in writing, that the data have been validated or updated, and provide the date of the validation or update.

(f) If the Contractor represented that it was other than a small business concern prior to award of this contract, the Contractor may, but is not required to, take the actions required by paragraphs (e) or (g) of this clause.

(g) If the Contractor does not have representations and certifications in ORCA, or does not have a representation in ORCA for the NAICS code applicable to this contract, the Contractor is required to complete the following rerepresentation and submit it to the contracting office, along with the contract number and the date on which the rerepresentation was completed:

The Contractor represents that it (  ) is, (  ) is not a small business concern under NAICS Code _334290_ assigned to contract number _____________.

ACQUISITION & ASSISTANCE POLICY DIRECTIVE (AAPD) NO. 06-10
PSC MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY

General Provision 22, MEDICAL EXPENSE PAYMENT RESPONSIBILITY
(OCTOBER 2006) 

(a) Definitions. Terms used in this General Provision are defined in 16
FAM 116 available at http://www.foia.state.gov/REGS/fams.asp?level=2&id=59&fam=0 .

Note:  Personal services contractors are not eligible to participate in the Federal Employees Health Programs.

(b) The regulations in the Foreign Affairs Manual, Volume 16, Chapter 520 (16 FAM 520), Responsibility for Payment of Medical Expenses, apply to this contract, except as stated below.  The contractor and each eligible family member are strongly encouraged to obtain health insurance that covers this assignment.  Nothing in this provision supersedes or contradicts any other term or provision in this contract that pertains to insurance or medical costs, except that section (e) supplements General Provision 25. "MEDICAL EVACUATION (MEDEVAC) SERVICES."

(c) When the contractor or eligible family member is covered by health insurance, that insurance is the primary payer for medical services provided to that contractor or eligible family member(s) both in the United States and abroad.  The primary insurer's liability is determined by the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the insurance policy.  When the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred and the U.S. Government has no payment obligation (see paragraph (f) of this provision).

(d) USAID serves as a secondary payer for medical expenses of the contractor and eligible family members who are covered by health insurance, where the following conditions are met:

(1) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense is incurred, caused, or materially aggravated while the eligible individual is stationed or assigned abroad;

(2) The illness, injury, or medical condition giving rise to the expense required or requires hospitalization and the expense is directly related to the treatment of such illness, injury, or medical condition, including obstetrical care; and

(3) The Office of Medical Services (M/MED) or a Foreign Service medical provider (FSMP) determines that the treatment is appropriate for, and directly related to, the illness, injury, or medical condition.

(e) The Mission Director may, on the advice of M/MED or an FSMP at post, authorize medical travel for the contractor or an eligible family member in accordance with the General Provision 10, Travel and Transportation Expenses (July 1993), section (i) entitled "Emergency and Irregular Travel and Transportation."  In the event of a medical emergency, when time does not permit consultation, the Mission Director may issue a Travel Authorization Form or Medical Services Authorization Form DS-3067, provided that the FSMP or Post Medical Advisor (PMA) is notified as soon as possible following such an issuance.  The contractor must promptly file a claim with his or her medevac insurance provider and repay to USAID any amount the medevac insurer pays for medical travel, up to the amount USAID paid under this section.  The contractor must repay USAID for medical costs paid by the medevac insurer in accordance with sections (f) and (g) below.  In order for medical travel to be an allowable cost under General Provision 10, the contractor must provide USAID written evidence that medevac insurance does not cover these medical travel costs.

(f) If the contractor or eligible family member is not covered by primary health insurance, the contractor is the primary payer for the total amount of medical costs incurred.  In the event of a medical emergency, the Medical and Health Program may authorize issuance of Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents, to secure admission to a hospital located abroad for the uninsured contractor or eligible family member.  In that case, the contractor will be required to reimburse USAID in full for funds advanced by USAID pursuant to the issuance of the authorization.  The contractor may reimburse USAID directly or USAID may offset the cost from the contractor's invoice payments under this contract, any other contract the individual has with the U.S. Government, or through any other available debt collection mechanism.

(g) When USAID pays medical expenses (e.g., pursuant to Form DS-3067, Authorization for Medical Services for Employees and/or Dependents), repayment must be made to USAID either by insurance payment or directly by the contractor, except for the amount of such expenses USAID is obligated to pay under this provision.  The Contracting Officer will determine the repayment amount in accordance with the terms of this provision and the policies and procedures for employees contained in 16 FAM 521.  When USAID pays the medical expenses, including medical travel costs (see section (e) above), of an individual (either the contractor or an eligible family member) who is covered by insurance, that individual promptly must claim his or her benefits under any applicable insurance policy or policies.  As soon as the individual receives the insurance payment, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the full amount that USAID paid on the individual's behalf or the repayment amount determined by the Contracting Officer in accordance with this paragraph, whichever is less.  If an individual is not covered by insurance, the contractor must reimburse USAID for the entire amount of all medical expenses and any travel costs the contractor receives from his/her medevac provider.

(h) In the event that the contractor or eligible family member fails to recover insurance payments or transfer the amount of such payments to USAID within 90 days, USAID will take appropriate action to collect the payments due, unless such failure is for reasons beyond the control of the USPSC/dependent.

(i) Before departing post or terminating the contract, the contractor must settle all medical expense and medical travel costs.  If the contractor is insured, he or she must provide proof to the Contracting Officer that those insurance claims have been submitted to the insurance carrier(s) and sign a repayment agreement to repay to USAID any amounts paid by the insurance carrier(s).

SUBJECT: The purpose of this Amendment is to provide Attachment 2 for the Solicitation for U.S. Personal Service Contractor for an Deputy Country Representative - Venezuela in Caracas, Venezuela. 

ATTACHMENT 2
INTERAGENCY LANGUAGE ROUNDTABLE LANGUAGE SKILL LEVEL DESCRIPTIONS

SPEAKING:
Speaking 0 (No Proficiency)
Unable to function in the spoken language. Oral production is limited to occasional isolated words. Has essentially no communicative ability. 

Speaking 0+ (Memorized Proficiency)
Able to satisfy immediate needs using rehearsed utterances. Shows little real autonomy of expression, flexibility or spontaneity. Can ask questions or make statements with reasonable accuracy only with memorized utterances or formulae. Attempts at creating speech are usually unsuccessful.

Examples: The individual's vocabulary is usually limited to areas of immediate survival needs. Most utterances are telegraphic; that is, functors (linking words, markers and the like) are omitted, confused or distorted. An individual can usually differentiate most significant sounds when produced in isolation but, when combined in words or groups of words, errors may be frequent. Even with repetition, communication is severely limited even with people used to dealing with foreigners. Stress, intonation, tone, etc. are usually quite faulty. 

Speaking 1 (Elementary Proficiency)
Able to satisfy minimum courtesy requirements and maintain very simple face-to-face conversations on familiar topics. A native speaker must often use slowed speech, repetition, paraphrase, or a combination of these to be understood by this individual. Similarly, the native speaker must strain and employ real-world knowledge to understand even simple statements/questions from this individual. This speaker has a functional, but limited proficiency. Misunderstandings are frequent, but the individual is able to ask for help and to verify comprehension of native speech in face-to-face interaction. The individual is unable to produce continuous discourse except with rehearsed material.

Examples: Structural accuracy is likely to be random or severely limited. Time concepts are vague. Vocabulary is inaccurate, and its range is very narrow. The individual often speaks with great difficulty. By repeating, such speakers can make themselves understood to native speakers who are in regular contact with foreigners but there is little precision in the information conveyed. Needs, experience or training may vary greatly from individual to individual; for example, speakers at this level may have encountered quite different vocabulary areas. However, the individual can typically satisfy predictable, simple, personal and accommodation needs; can generally meet courtesy, introduction, and identification requirements; exchange greetings; elicit and provide, for example, predictable and skeletal biographical information. He/she might give information about business hours; explain routine procedures in a limited way and state in a simple manner what actions will be taken. He/she is able to formulate some questions even in languages with complicated question constructions. Almost every utterance may be characterized by structural errors and errors in basic grammatical relations. Vocabulary is extremely limited and characteristically does not include modifiers. Pronunciation, stress, and intonation are generally poor, often heavily influenced by another language. Use of structure and vocabulary is highly imprecise. 

Speaking 1+ (Elementary Proficiency, Plus)
Can initiate and maintain predictable face-to-face conversations and satisfy limited social demands. He/she may, however, have little understanding of the social conventions of conversation. The interlocutor is generally required to strain and employ real-world knowledge to understand even some simple speech. The speaker at this level may hesitate and may have to change subjects due to lack of language resources. Range and control of the language are limited. Speech largely consists of a series of short, discrete utterances.

Examples: The individual is able to satisfy most travel and accommodation needs and a limited range of social demands beyond exchange of skeletal biographic information. Speaking ability may extend beyond immediate survival needs. Accuracy in basic grammatical relations is evident, although not consistent. May exhibit the more common forms of verb tenses, for example, but may make frequent errors in formation and selection. While some structures are established, errors occur in more complex patterns. The individual typically cannot sustain coherent structures in longer utterances or unfamiliar situations. Ability to describe and give precise information is limited. Person, space and time references are often used incorrectly. Pronunciation is understandable to natives used to dealing with foreigners. Can combine most significant sounds with reasonable comprehensibility, but has difficulty in producing certain sounds in certain positions or in certain combinations. Speech will usually be labored. Frequently has to repeat utterances to be understood by the general public. 

Speaking 2 (Limited Working Proficiency) 
Able to satisfy routine social demands and limited work requirements. Can handle routine work-related interactions that are limited in scope. In more complex and sophisticated work-related tasks, language usage generally disturbs the native speaker. Can handle with confidence, but not with facility, most normal, high-frequency social conversational situations including extensive, but casual conversations about current events, as well as work, family, and autobiographical information. The individual can get the gist of most everyday conversations but has some difficulty understanding native speakers in situations that require specialized or sophisticated knowledge. The individual's utterances are minimally cohesive. Linguistic structure is usually not very elaborate and not thoroughly controlled; errors are frequent. Vocabulary use is appropriate for high-frequency utterances, but unusual or imprecise elsewhere.

Examples: While these interactions will vary widely from individual to individual, the individual can typically ask and answer predictable questions in the workplace and give straightforward instructions to subordinates. Additionally, the individual can participate in personal and accommodation-type interactions with elaboration and facility; that is, can give and understand complicated, detailed, and extensive directions and make non-routine changes in travel and accommodation arrangements. Simple structures and basic grammatical relations are typically controlled; however, there are areas of weakness. In the commonly taught languages, these may be simple markings such as plurals, articles, linking words, and negatives or more complex structures such as tense/aspect usage, case morphology, passive constructions, word order, and embedding. 

Speaking 2+ (Limited Working Proficiency, Plus)
Able to satisfy most work requirements with language usage that is often, but not always, acceptable and effective. The individual shows considerable ability to communicate effectively on topics relating to particular interests and special fields of competence. Often shows a high degree of fluency and ease of speech, yet when under tension or pressure, the ability to use the language effectively may deteriorate. Comprehension of normal native speech is typically nearly complete. The individual may miss cultural and local references and may require a native speaker to adjust to his/her limitations in some ways. Native speakers often perceive the individual's speech to contain awkward or inaccurate phrasing of ideas, mistaken time, space and person references, or to be in some way inappropriate, if not strictly incorrect.

Examples: Typically the individual can participate in most social, formal, and informal interactions, but limitations either in range of contexts, types of tasks or level of accuracy hinder effectiveness. The individual may be ill at ease with the use of the language either in social interaction or in speaking at length in professional contexts. He/she is generally strong in either structural precision or vocabulary, but not in both. Weakness or unevenness in one of the foregoing, or in pronunciation, occasionally results in miscommunication. Normally controls, but cannot always easily produce general vocabulary. Discourse is often incohesive. 

Speaking 3 (General Professional Proficiency)
Able to speak the language with sufficient structural accuracy and vocabulary to participate effectively in most formal and informal conversations in practical, social and professional topics. Nevertheless, the individual's limitations generally restrict the professional contexts of language use to matters of shared knowledge and/or international convention. Discourse is cohesive. The individual uses the language acceptably, but with some noticeable imperfections; yet, errors virtually never interfere with understanding and rarely disturb the native speaker. The individual can effectively combine structure and vocabulary to convey his/her meaning accurately. The individual speaks readily and fills pauses suitably. In face-to-face conversation with natives speaking the standard dialect at a normal rate of speech, comprehension is quite complete. Although cultural references, proverbs and the implications of nuances and idiom may not be fully understood, the individual can easily repair the conversation. Pronunciation may be obviously foreign. Individual sounds are accurate: but stress, intonation and pitch control may be faulty.

Examples: Can typically discuss particular interests and special fields of competence with reasonable ease. Can use the language as part of normal professional duties such as answering objections, clarifying points, justifying decisions, understanding the essence of challenges, stating and defending policy, conducting meetings, delivering briefings, or other extended and elaborate informative monologues. Can reliably elicit information and informed opinion from native speakers. Structural inaccuracy is rarely the major cause of misunderstanding. Use of structural devices is flexible and elaborate. Without searching for words or phrases, the individual uses the language clearly and relatively naturally to elaborate concepts freely and make ideas easily understandable to native speakers. Errors occur in low-frequency and highly complex structures. 

Speaking 3+ (General Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Is often able to use the language to satisfy professional needs in a wide range of sophisticated and demanding tasks.

Examples: Despite obvious strengths, may exhibit some hesitancy, uncertainty, effort or errors which limit the range of language-use tasks that can be reliably performed. Typically there is particular strength in fluency and one or more, but not all, of the following: breadth of lexicon, including low- and medium-frequency items, especially socio-linguistic/cultural references and nuances of close synonyms; structural precision, with sophisticated features that are readily, accurately and appropriately controlled (such as complex modification and embedding in Indo-European languages); discourse competence in a wide range of contexts and tasks, often matching a native speaker's strategic and organizational abilities and expectations. Occasional patterned errors occur in low frequency and highly-complex structures. 

Speaking 4 (Advanced Professional Proficiency)
Able to use the language fluently and accurately on all levels normally pertinent to professional needs. The individual's language usage and ability to function are fully successful. Organizes discourse well, using appropriate rhetorical speech devices, native cultural references and understanding. Language ability only rarely hinders him/her in performing any task requiring language; yet, the individual would seldom be perceived as a native. Speaks effortlessly and smoothly and is able to use the language with a high degree of effectiveness, reliability and precision for all representational purposes within the range of personal and professional experience and scope of responsibilities. Can serve as in informal interpreter in a range of unpredictable circumstances. Can perform extensive, sophisticated language tasks, encompassing most matters of interest to well-educated native speakers, including tasks which do not bear directly on a professional specialty.

Examples: Can discuss in detail concepts which are fundamentally different from those of the target culture and make those concepts clear and accessible to the native speaker. Similarly, the individual can understand the details and ramifications of concepts that are culturally or conceptually different from his/her own. Can set the tone of interpersonal official, semi-official and non-professional verbal exchanges with a representative range of native speakers (in a range of varied audiences, purposes, tasks and settings). Can play an effective role among native speakers in such contexts as conferences, lectures and debates on matters of disagreement. Can advocate a position at length, both formally and in chance encounters, using sophisticated verbal strategies. Understands and reliably produces shifts of both subject matter and tone. Can understand native speakers of the standard and other major dialects in essentially any face-to-face interaction. 

Speaking 4+ (Advanced Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Speaking proficiency is regularly superior in all respects, usually equivalent to that of a well educated, highly articulate native speaker. Language ability does not impede the performance of any language-use task. However, the individual would not necessarily be perceived as culturally native.

Examples: The individual organizes discourse well, employing functional rhetorical speech devices, native cultural references and understanding. Effectively applies a native speaker's social and circumstantial knowledge; however, cannot sustain that performance under all circumstances. While the individual has a wide range and control of structure, an occasional nonnative slip may occur. The individual has a sophisticated control of vocabulary and phrasing that is rarely imprecise, yet there are occasional weaknesses in idioms, colloquialisms, pronunciation, and cultural reference or there may be an occasional failure to interact in a totally native manner. 

Speaking 5 (Functionally Native Proficiency)
Speaking proficiency is functionally equivalent to that of a highly articulate well-educated native speaker and reflects the cultural standards of the country where the language is natively spoken. The individual uses the language with complete flexibility and intuition, so that speech on all levels is fully accepted by well-educated native speakers in all of its features, including breadth of vocabulary and idiom, colloquialisms and pertinent cultural references. Pronunciation is typically consistent with that of well-educated native speakers of a non-stigmatized dialect. 


WRITING:
Writing 0 (No Proficiency)
No functional writing ability. 

Writing 0+ (Memorized Proficiency)
Writes using memorized material and set expressions. Can produce symbols in an alphabetic or syllabic writing system or 50 of the most common characters. Can write numbers and dates, own name, nationality, address, etc., such as on a hotel registration form. Otherwise, ability to write is limited to simple lists of common items such as a few short sentences. Spelling and even representation of symbols (letters, syllables, and characters) may be incorrect. 

Writing 1 (Elementary Proficiency)
Has sufficient control of the writing system to meet limited practical needs. Can create by writing statements and questions on topics very familiar to him/her within the scope of his/her very limited language experience. Writing vocabulary is inadequate to express anything but elementary needs; writes in simple sentences making continual errors in spelling, grammar and punctuation but writing can be read and understood by a native reader used to dealing with foreigners attempting to write his/her language. Writing tends to be a loose collection of sentences (or fragments) on a given topic and provides little evidence of conscious organization. While topics which are "very familiar" and elementary needs vary considerably from individual to individual, any person at this level should be able to write simple phone messages, excuses, notes to service people and simple notes to friends. 

Writing 1+ (Elementary Proficiency, Plus)
Sufficient control of writing system to meet most survival needs and limited social demands. Can create sentences and short paragraphs related to most survival needs (food, lodging, transportation, immediate surroundings and situations) and limited social demands. Can express fairly accurate present and future time. Can produce some past verb forms but not always accurately or with correct usage. Can relate personal history, discuss topics such as daily life, preferences and very familiar material. Shows good control of elementary vocabulary and some control of basic syntactic patterns but major errors still occur when expressing more complex thoughts. Dictionary usage may still yield incorrect vocabulary or terms, although the individual can use a dictionary to advantage to express simple ideas. Generally cannot use basic cohesive elements of discourse to advantage (such as relative constructions, object pronouns, connectors, etc.). Can take notes in some detail on familiar topics, and respond to personal questions using elementary vocabulary and common structures. Can write simple letters, summaries of biographical data and work experience with fair accuracy. Writing, though faulty, is comprehensible to native speakers used to dealing with foreigners. 

Writing 2 (Limited Working Proficiency) 
Able to write routine social correspondence and prepare documentary materials required for most limited work requirements. Has writing vocabulary sufficient to express himself/herself simply with some circumlocutions. Can write simply about a very limited number of current events or daily situations. Still makes common errors in spelling and punctuation, but shows some control of the most common formats and punctuation conventions. Good control of morphology of language (in inflected languages) and of the most frequently used syntactic structures. Elementary constructions are usually handled quite accurately and writing is understandable to a native reader not used to reading the writing of foreigners. Uses a limited number of cohesive devices. 

Writing 2+ (Limited Working Proficiency, Plus)
Shows ability to write with some precision and in some detail about most common topics. Can write about concrete topics relating to particular interests and special fields of competence. Often shows surprising fluency and ease of expression but under time constraints and pressure language may be inaccurate and/or incomprehensible. Generally strong in either grammar or vocabulary but not in both. Weaknesses or unevenness in one of the foregoing or in spelling result in occasional miscommunication. Areas of weakness range from simple constructions such as plurals, articles, prepositions and negatives to more complex structures such as tense usage, passive constructions, word order and relative clauses. Normally controls general vocabulary with some misuse of everyday vocabulary evident. Shows a limited ability to use circumlocutions Uses dictionary to advantage to supply unknown words. Can take fairly accurate notes on material presented orally and handle with fair accuracy most social correspondence. Writing is understandable to native speakers not used to dealing with foreigners' attempts to write the language, though style is still obviously foreign. 

Writing 3 (General Professional Proficiency)
Able to use the language effectively in most formal and informal written exchanges on practical, social and professional topics. Can write reports, summaries, and short library research papers on current events, on particular areas of interest or on special fields with reasonable ease. Control of structure, spelling and general vocabulary is adequate to convey his/her message accurately but style may be obviously foreign. Errors virtually never interfere with comprehension and rarely disturb the native reader. Punctuation generally controlled. Employs a full range of structures. Control of grammar good with only sporadic errors in basic structures, occasional errors in the most complex frequent structures and somewhat more frequent errors in low frequency complex structures. Consistent control of compound and complex sentences. Relationship of ideas is consistently clear. 

Writing 3+ (General Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Able to write the language in a few prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. Not always able to tailor language to suit audience. Weaknesses may be in poor control of low frequency complex structures, vocabulary or the ability to express subtleties, and nuances. May be able to write on some topics pertinent to professional/educational needs. Organization may suffer due to lack of variety in organizational patterns or in variety of cohesive devices. 

Writing 4 (Advanced Professional Proficiency)
Able to write the language precisely and accurately in a variety of prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. Errors of grammar are rare including those in low frequency complex structures. Consistently able to tailor language to suit audience and able to express subtleties and nuances. Expository prose is clearly, consistently and explicitly organized. The writer employs a variety of organizational patterns, uses a wide variety of cohesive devices such as ellipses and parallelisms, and subordinates in a variety of ways. Able to write on all topics normally pertinent to professional and educational needs and on social issues of a general nature. Writing adequate to express all his/her experiences. 

Writing 4+ (Advanced Professional Proficiency, Plus)
Able to write the language precisely and accurately in a wide variety of prose styles pertinent to professional/educational needs. May have some ability to edit but not in the full range of styles. Has some flexibility within a style and shows some evidence of a use of stylistic devices. 

Writing 5 (Functionally Native Proficiency)
Has writing proficiency equal to that of a well educated native. Without non-native errors of structure, spelling, style or vocabulary can write and edit both formal and informal correspondence, official reports and documents, and professional/ educational articles including writing for special purposes which might include legal, technical, educational, literary and colloquial writing. In addition to being clear, explicit and informative, the writing and the ideas are also imaginative. The writer employs a very wide range of stylistic devices.?

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR AUTOMATED SYSTEM FOR DRYING AEROGELS USING SUPERCRITICAL CARBON DIOXIDE.	Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment No. 1 is to provide answers to clarification questions submitted in response to NNC08230834Q and to extend the due date for offers to 4:30 PM EDT on March 26, 2008. The answers to the clarification questions follow: Question - Referring to paragraph 1b, is the "user selectable rate" pressure or flow? If it's flow is it the CO2 or the combined CO2 and solvent? Answer- This is a flow rate. The purpose of step1b is to displace the bulk solvent surrounding the samples with liquid CO2. This needs to be done at a controlled rate to prevent damage to the samples, so the critical rate is the rate of solvent removal. The user selectable rate should reflect the rate of solvent removal. Question - Referring to 1g, is the "user selectable rate" pressure or flow? Should each vessel have its own flowmeter? Answer - Step 1g vents the supercritical CO2 in the extraction chamber until the chamber reaches ambient pressure and is safe to open. This must be done at a controlled rate to prevent damage to the samples due to pressure gradients within the sample. This rate could be in terms of either pressure or flow, but each vessel must be instrumented appropriately both to control the rate and to allow the operators to know when the vent is complete. Question - Are all the on-off valves and the flow control valves automated? Answer- Yes, we intend that the drying process be completely automated. Question- Referring to paragraph 8 and 9, do all the vessels have the same operating conditions when operated at the same time? Answer- Yes. All of the vessels should experience the same operating conditions although, as stated in paragraph 8 if it is not practical to fill or drain all chambers simultaneously they can be operated sequentially within a step. The specified flow rate and temperature in a step will apply to all of the vessels during that step although they all may not be filling or venting simultaneously. Question - Referring to paragraph 17, what is NMP? Are we correct in assuming that the flow will be in the top and out the bottom? If not should the system be plumbed to operate in reverse also? Answer- NMP is N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone, CAS number [872-50-4], density @ 25 C is 1.028 g/cc. You can assume flow into the top of the vessel and out of the bottom. Question -What is the maximum system pressure and temperature? This information is needed to spec the vessels. Answer - The process requires temperatures up to 60 C and pressures of at least 100 Bar (1450 psig). A maximum temperature of 100 C and a maximum pressure of 200 Bar would cover our entire range of interest with some margin. Question - Are vessel baskets needed? Answer - Vessel baskets are not required. The due date for responses is extended. All submissions are now due via email to BOTH Dawn R. Pottinger and J. Chris Johnston by 4:30 PM EDT on March 26, 2008.  Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on March 7, 2008.Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis and solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotes are being requested and A WRITTEN SOLICITATION WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   The solicitation number for this procurement is F2Q3658059A002 and is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is 541620. This requirement is a total (100%) Small Business Set-Aside. SPECIFICATIONS:  Storm Water Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation for Langley Air Force Base.  The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (VDEQ) issued Langley Air Force Base (AFB) a Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) Individual Permit for Industrial Storm Water Discharges in May 2005.  The permit requires Langley AFB to perform an annual Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation (CSCE).  This evaluation ensures that the Base remains compliant with the permits requirements and the guidelines prescribed in the Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP).  The purpose of this work is to perform the annual CSCE as required by the Base's existing individual storm water discharge permit (VA0083194).  The completed document should be designed and tailored for its intended audience, being as brief as possible but still presenting the required information in a readily accessible manner. The project shall be accomplished in three phases.  Phase I shall be the Kick-off Meeting.  Phase II shall encompass visual inspections of the individual base industrial activities to perform the CSCE and contractor preparation of the CSCE report.  The contractor shall furnish all materials, equipment, supplies, personnel, transportation, and all other resources necessary, to perform a CSCE, evaluate the efficiency of current storm water Best Management Practices (BMPs) identified during the site evaluation.  Applicable Laws and Regulations:  Occupational Health and Safety Administration, Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1910.120, July 1, 1994. Clean Water Act (as amended); 40 CFR 122.  DOD Directive 6050. 1: Environmental Effects in the United States of DOD Actions, July 1979.  Langley AFB Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit (No. VA0083194), 2 May 2005.  9 VAC 25-31-10 et seq. Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (VPDES) Permit, 11 April 2001. Regulations and permits for Virginia may be more stringent than the federal laws and must be considered in assessments.  In addition, contractor must ensure that CSCE requirement meets all Air Force requirements, and appropriate regulatory guidance, to include but not limited to:  Air Force Center for Environmental Excellence, Installation Stormwater Pollution Prevention Guide, updated May 1997, Air Force Instruction (AFI) 32-7041, Water Quality Compliance,13 May 1994,  AFI 32-7080,Pollution Prevention Program, 12 May 1994; Air Force Policy Directive (AFPD) 32-70, ?Environmental Quality,? 20 July 1994; Executive Order 12088, Federal Compliance with Pollution Control Standards,  13 October 1978; United States Environmental Protection Agency, Storm Water Management for Industrial Activities, Developing Pollution Prevention Plans and Best Management Practices (EPA 832-R-92-006).  The Government will supply the contractor upon request with available copies (either hard copy or electronic file) of engineering drawings of the installation?s storm sewer system including outfalls, monitoring stations, previous CSCE reports or related engineering studies, operating records and analytical results, and other documents that may be of value in defining the installations SWPPP issues.  The contractor shall reproduce these documents and return the originals to the government within 72 hours of issue. Site visits and meetings are to be combined whenever possible.  The contractor shall prepare a meeting notice and agenda for each meeting attended by the contractor.  In addition to developing an agenda, the contractor shall prepare a presentation, appropriate for the occasion, and handle the administrative details of the meeting.  The administrative details the contractor shall perform, with assistance from the Technical Representative, include: set the time and secure the location of the meeting, notify potential attendees of the meeting arrangements, pass out an attendance sheet at the meeting, take notes of salient points of the meeting, prepare and distribute a conference report on the meeting to all attendees within 14 calendar days of the meeting and revise the conference report should the government request it.  The contractor shall initiate the project with a kickoff meeting at Langley AFB, VA. This kickoff meeting shall cover the CSCE requirement. During this meeting, the contractor shall introduce the personnel proposed to work on the CSCE and their respective roles and responsibilities.  The presentation shall be complete upon submission, by the contractor, of an organization flow chart illustrating the roles and responsibilities of contractor personnel on these projects.  During this meeting, the contractor shall present his approach to both projects.  The contractor shall present proposed outlines, formats, and contents for the CSCE and demonstrate how this approach will best meet the goals of the project.  Also, the proposed agenda for the first meeting with the VDEQ regulators will be presented and discussed at this time. The contractor shall coordinate with 1 CES/CEVC to develop the agenda.  The contractor shall visit each individual base industrial activity to perform a Comprehensive Site Compliance Evaluation.  The evaluation shall provide the following information and documentation: A visual inspection of areas contributing to storm water discharges associated with industrial activity.  The purpose being to identify existing and potential sources of pollutants entering the storm sewer system; An evaluation of measures to reduce pollutant loadings to determine if existing controls are adequate and properly implemented in accordance with the terms of the permit or whether additional measures are needed;  Structural storm water management measures, sediment and erosion control measures, and other structural pollution control measures identified in the plan shall be observed to ensure they are operating properly;  A visual inspection of equipment needed to implement the plan, such as spill response equipment, shall be made;  Based on the results of the inspection, the description of potential pollutant sources identified in the plan and pollution prevention measures and controls identified in the plan shall be revised as appropriate.  This task shall be accomplished in conjunction with Air Force personnel.  This approach allows the contractor to validate existing information and discuss additional modifications or improvements that can be incorporated into the CSCE.

The progress report shall include a brief narrative, addressing the major work items, as well as a time-scaled bar chart or CPM design schedule showing the sequence of the events involved in carrying out the project within the specified period of performance.  The chart should provide a general level of scheduling with planning efforts focused on identifying major items that most often control the flow of work.  This schedule should also be a forward planning monitoring tool with milestone submittal dates clearly identified.  The monthly report shall be submitted to the Technical Representative and contract administrator until the project is at closeout as specified by the contracting officer.  The table at Attachment 1 contains the deliverable schedule.  Attachment 2 contains the payment-monitoring plan.  The contractor shall prepare and submit a cover sheet and Letter of Transmittal for each submittal other than the monthly report.  At a minimum, the letter shall include the following information: a. Contract and delivery order number, b. SOW reference, c. Date of submittal, d. Brief description of item(s) being submitted, e. Contractor's point of contact.  Unless otherwise specified in the SOW, only a copy of the transmittal letter shall be submitted to the contracting officer.

The vendor(s) shall provide each laboratory with a list of deficiencies to correct and allow written responses to these deficiencies before final disposition and accreditation.  The vendor(s) must provide reports to the laboratory, the Pathology Regional Commissioners and the P&LMS National Enforcement Office in headquarters. If interim annual self-inspections are required as a part of the accreditation process, the laboratory will retain the list of deficiencies and corrective action for review at the next onsite inspection, but results of these inspections/surveys will be tracked and published in the report for the P&LMS National Enforcement Office.  Inspectors/Surveyors must be knowledgeable in the areas being inspected. The vendor(s) will define standards for inspectors/surveyors. Vendor(s) must describe in detail their inspection process, including their requirements for inspections/surveys and training provided to the inspectors/surveyors.  Deficiencies will be specifically noted in writing and the laboratory must be informed of all deficiencies. Serious deficiencies will require follow up correction by the laboratory.  The entire process for noting deficiencies, required follow-up, and any additional inspections, will be well documented.  The P&LMS National Enforcement Office and relevant Regional Commissioner's Office will be kept appraised of such actions. The vendor(s) will provide the laboratory with a copy of the standards used for the inspection/survey.  The laboratory medical director will be notified of the need for inspection/survey six months before the inspection/survey date and provided with the necessary forms needed to apply for inspection/survey.  The laboratory will be provided with the name of the inspection/survey leader and specific inspection/survey date together with any requests or information to be sent to the inspector/surveyor six weeks before date of the inspection/survey.

Offerors must provide the past performance questionnaire in Attachment 2 to references to complete and forward to the VA prior to the closing date of this solicitation.  Volume II, Price Proposal - submit a schedule of fixed prices for specific CMS CLIA compliant laboratory accreditation services as described in Attachment 1 - the Statement of Work.  The Government desires pricing at a discount to the Offeror's current pricelist for the same commercial services. Attachment 3 Pricing Template provides a pricing template.  For other than small businesses (which include nonprofit organizations of any size) a FAR 19 compliant subcontracting plan must be submitted within 90 days after award of a contract resulting from this solicitation.  Provide proposals in 2 hard copies and one CD or disk.  In accordance with FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items - The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible low priced technically acceptable Offeror. The following technical factors shall be used to evaluate offers:  Qualifications: CMS deemed status for medical service lab accreditation for all tests under CMS (acceptable /unacceptable); Past Performance -  in supplying timely accreditation reviews (acceptable/unacceptable); Technical Approach - a sound technical approach to providing the required accreditation reviews, feedback, and reports required by the SOW (acceptable/unacceptable) .  No Offeror without deemed status shall be awarded a contract.  Price shall be evaluated for amount and reasonableness.  The Offeror must provide a rational basis for the price proposed using complexity points or other defined criteria for lab size and complexity used in its accreditation practice. This basis shall be used to establish CLINS which allow fixed prices for labs of differing sizes, tests and complexity levels.  Offerors may submit their discounted "commercial" price list with an explanation of how the pricing would apply to 3 lab types (minimal, moderate, and high complexity as defined in current accreditation standards).  The price must include the not separately priced reports required in the statement of work.  The Offeror's evaluated price will be price for the base and all option periods in Attachment Three.

<DESC>1.  Title:  VA Patient Food Safety and Defense Program 2.  Solicitation Reference Number:  VA-101-08-RQ-0126 Amendment 1 3.  Description:  Request for Quote (RFQ) #: VA-101-08-RQ-0126 is hereby amended to answer vendor submitted questions in response to the solicitation. The due date and time for receipt of quotations has NOT changed as a result of this amendment. 4. Questions and Answers:  1. No page limitation was cited for the Technical Quotation.  If there is a limit, what is it and do Past Performance citations and resumes for Key Personnel count toward that page limitation? Answer: A page limitation has not been established. 2. We are assuming that Past Performance citations include Past Performance for Key Personnel and subcontractors.  Please let us know if this is not the case. Answer: Past performance information shall be reflective of corporate experience relative to the SOW tasking. Information on key personnel and subcontractors may be included. 3. Will the VA use ORCA for reps and certs in lieu of submitting a copy? Answer: Yes. Please note any solicitation requiring an active registration in CCR, such as this one, requires registration in ORCA. 4. The Statement of Work states that there will be one site visit. Considering that one of the areas that much be addressed in this study is the variance between stated national policies and actual operations in the field, would the VA consider an optional submission as part of this quotation to increase the number of site visits? Answer: At this time VA is requesting one site visit. If additional analysis is required at other facilities, it will be via a separate contract. 5. Should estimated travel expenses be included in the cost quotation? Answer: The location of the site visit is within the DC Metropolitan area and would be considered a local commuting expense for vendors located in this area. Contractors located outside of the DC Metropolitan area may submit travel expenses as part of its price quotation. 6. Section J states that Contractor employees who require access to the VA's computer systems or data shall have a background investigation.  Does the VA anticipate that personnel reviewing VA policies and procedures for Food Safety and Defense would require a background investigation?  Would personnel who perform an on-site survey require a background investigation? Answer: Personnel reviewing VA policies and procedures as well as those performing the on-site survey require a background investigation. 7. The Statement of Work is for a vulnerability assessment and gap analysis, along with recommendations for the implementation of changes.  Will performance on this SOW constitute an Organizational Conflict of Interest for any future VA requirements in Patient Food Safety and Defense, such as implementation and process improvement as a result of this assessment? Answer: The Government does not anticipate a conflict of interest as VA will bear the sole responsibility for implementation and process improvements as a result of Contractor assessments.
