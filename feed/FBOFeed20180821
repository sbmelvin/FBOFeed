<div><br />The person will use the Reclamation's call logging software for all work activities.<br />System Administration</div>
<div><br />Reclamation currently has 17 servers that host and operate the Meridian system for various locations.

<div><br />Application Maintenance:</div>
<div><br />In addition to regular monitoring of servers, the Meridian application itself requires elements of maintenance and general user assistance.

<div><br /></div>
<div><br />Meridian Architecture Support</div>
<div><br />Meridian architecture support covers centralization of the current Meridian systems, extending the system, and adjustments to the configuration and scripting related to patches, updates, and enhancements.</div>
<div><br />Centralization:<br />Reclamation has interest in centralizing the eDRAWS architecture which equates to the unification of servers into a single architecture, with all remote sites accessing via the web browser Meridian interface, while implementing appropriate redundancy of data.<br />Proposed activities related to centralization include:</div>
<div><br />&bull; Existing architecture review;<br />&bull; Future use analysis (user counts, document counts, usage patterns);<br />&bull; Existing solution configuration review (alignment across locations, readiness for web interface);<br />&bull; Future proposed architecture/infrastructure needs (including site cache services);<br />&bull; Proof of Concept phase<br />o Prepare POC for web-only interface to replica system;<br />o Identify key use cases for testing (performance and usability);<br />o Support test execution by allocated personnel;<br />o Report findings and recommendations.<br />&bull; Prepare outline of proposed conversion to a centralized system<br />Equipped with the above data and findings, Reclamation will be better prepared to make the decision on centralization and determine a suitable roll-out plan.<br />Extending the system:<br />The Meridian system can be enhanced significantly through initiatives aimed at getting more value from their eDRAWS investment.<br />These initiatives include assessment, planning and scoping of the following:<br />&bull; Integration with IBM Maximo - Provide users with direct access to drawings, documents and other Meridian content directly from the Maximo interface. <br />&bull; Tag data extraction - Linking or associating drawings and documents to equipment data to make the Maximo integration more complete.<br />&bull; Data analysis &amp; cleansing - Data accuracy and consistency through analysis and bulk changes/corrections.<br />&bull; Dashboard reporting - Workflow processes, work activity, data integrity, and other relevant real-time data via dashboard reporting.</div>

Hy-line Fertile Chicken Eggs are currently used in human candidate vaccine production for influenza pandemic planning. If a different egg is used, the genetic content and potential quality of the eggs are subject to change. This may negatively affect the yield of vaccine candidates produced and the Virology, Surveillance and Diagnosis Branch's ability to generate candidate vaccine viruses, which is mission-critical for the Influenza Division, NCIRD and the CDC. Continuing to receive Hy-line Fertile Chicken Eggs will ensure the consistent quality of CDC's influenza vaccine seeds and safeguard CDC's ability to meet the mission of influenza pandemic preparedness by protecting the United States and the world.
<p>Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice, their written capabilities statement which shall be considered by the agency.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION FOR REQUIREMENT
MOBILE FOLD-OUT MEDICAL UNITS
The products should be equivalent to the manufacturer:  Elite Aluminum Corporation, product C-FORTS 4 Room Medical Shelter System, product #CG964MC)
Veterans Health Administration currently has a requirement to procure expandable self-contained standalone mobile fold out shelters that will serve the Veteran and civilian populations as medical clinics. The shelters would be used to create an efficient clinic system which is a model of traditional primary care.  

BACKGROUND: Mobile Medical Units were deployed during the 2017 Hurricane Season, to support devastated communities with emergency health care and enhance the rebuilding efforts.   The VA identified during the response there was a need for additional units to support the VHA Mission and the National Response Framework requirements.  The Office of Emergency Management has researched mobile medical capabilities to ensure VA Leadership is provided with the best solution for securing additional resources that are deployable, will provide the required space and equipment, and be easily transportable into the impacted area to fulfill the mission.  The VA plan is to pre-position Fold Out Medical Shelters at different Veterans Affairs Medical Center locations throughout the United States.

However, firms that believe they can provide the capability required to fully meet the Government's requirement may submit a capabilities statement, including past performance, in writing to the identified point of contact within ten (10) days after publication of this notice. Such documentation shall be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. A determination not to compete this requirement, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit offers on NOI-RML-1915950.</p>
<p>This notice does not obligate the Government to award a contract or otherwise pay for any information provided in response. The Government reserves the right to use information provided by respondents for any purpose deemed necessary and legally appropriate. Any organization responding to this notice should ensure that its response is complete and sufficiently detailed to allow the Government to determine the organization's qualifications to perform the work.

<DESC>This contract action is for the acquisition of supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 13.106-1(b)(1). The National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS), Office of Acquisitions (OA) intends to award a single source purchase order to Covaris, Inc., 14 Gill Street, Unit H, Woburn, MA 01801-1721, for the acquisition of a E220 Focused UltraSonicator Instrument. It has been determined that Covaris, Inc., is the only known responsible source capable of providing the required instrument and no other instrument will satisfy the agency's requirements.
<p>The anticipated delivery time is 2-8 Weeks, ARO.</p>
<p>The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 335999 "All Other Miscellaneous Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing". Its associated Business Size Standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>The Covaris 220 Focused UltraSonicator, is the only instrument available that provides Adaptive Focused Acoustics (AFA) technology. AFA is an integral part for processing non-discrimination DNA samples for NGS sequencing. Acoustic disruption of tissue samples and cells is accomplished using ultrasonic energy at 500 KHz. In contrast to mechanical methods (mortar/pestle, polytron, bead-beaters) and probe sonicators, the sample never comes into contact with a mechanical device thus eliminating sample loss and cross contamination. The Covaris E220-Focused-Ultrasonicator has special features that create the highest quality material for NextGen Sequencing library generation which in turn give the best results and highest amount of usable data.<br />The Covaris instrument is the excepted standard by researchers worldwide for the performance of shearing of DNA for creating NextGen libraries. The system frequency must be within the ultrasonic range (wavelengths on average less then 1mm in length), and thus outside the human audible range. This is essential so that the instrument can be operated in a general laboratory bench setting without extra expense for system enclosures to ensure proper ear protection.<br /></p>

<p>THIS IS A PRE-SOLICITATION NON-COMPETITIVE NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT OR PURCHASE ORDER WITHOUT PROVIDING FOR FULL OR OPEN COMPETITION (INCLUDING BRAND-NAME).</p>
<p>The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Office of Acquisitions on behalf of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences intends to negotiate and award a contract for Mouse Asexual Blood Stage Malaria Model Services.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NORTH AMERICAN INDUSTRY CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM (NAICS) CODE</span></strong><br />The intended procurement is classified under NAICS code 541380 - Testing Laboratories with a Size Standard of 15.0 million.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">REGULATORY AUTHORITY </span></strong><br />The resultant contract will include all applicable provisions and clauses of the Federal acquisition Requlation (FAR) in effect through the Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-99, dated June 15, 2018.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STATUTORY AUTHORITY </span></strong><br />This acquisition is conducted as non-competitive under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c) under provisions of the statutory authority of FAR Subpart 6.302-1 -- Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements.</p>
<p>This acquisition is conducted under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13-Simplified Acquisition Procedures, Subpart 13.106-1 (b) (1), Soliciting from a single source.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DESCRIPTION OF REQUIREMENT </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Project Description</span><br />Project Title: Mouse Asexual Blood Stage Malaria Model Service</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Background Information and Statement of Need</span><br />Malaria affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide, particularly in the tropical regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, and approximately 650,000 patients die each year.  Even while on current therapies, patients remain infectious for a period of time, allowing further mosquito-borne transmission to others.</p>
<p>Control of parasite transmission is critical for elimination and eradication of malaria.  However, most antimalarial drugs are not active against sexual stage P. falciparum parasites-called gametocytes-which are responsible for the spread of malaria from person-to-person via mosquitoes.  Torin2 was identified as a lead molecule in a new class of gametocytocidal antimalarial drugs.</p>
<p>As part of a lead optimization program, researchers are using a gametocyte viability assay, an asexual stage parasite assay, malaria asexual animal testing, gametocyte animal testing, liver stage animal testing, and non-human primates testing to optimize the Torin2 series and advance a drug candidate through pre-clinical development and early clinical development.</p>
<p>The scope of work for this acquisition is for mouse asexual blood stage malaria model service.  The service will measure efficacy and acute toxicity of Torin2 analogs on a quarterly basis.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Period of Performance</span><br />The period of performance for this acquisition is twenty-four months starting upon award.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Requirements</span><br />Independently and not as an agent of the Government, the Contractor shall furnish all the necessary services, qualified personnel, material, equipment, and facilities, not otherwise provided by the Government as needed to complete the below requirements.</p>
<p>This acquisition is for services to measure the survivability of mice and parasite clearance following administration of drug either once on day 2 post infection, once a day on days 2 and 3 post infection, or once a day on days 2, 3, and 4 post infection. Each time the service is performed, positive control (chloroquine) with 5 mice, vehicle control with 5 mice, and 10 indicated unknown compounds (5 mice each group for unknown compounds) must be tested for a total of 12 groups.  In addition:</p>
<p>1.	The positive control group of 5 mice must be treated with chloroquine p.o. on day 2 and day 3; the negative control group with 5 mice will be treated with vehicle on day 2 and day 3. The remaining 10 groups (5 mice in each group) must be individually treated with 10 unknown compounds p.o. (Dosages for unknown compounds will be determined by the Government before the start date of each service).</p>
<p>2.	At day 0, 5X106 P. berghei-infected erythrocytes (ANKA strain) must be inoculated into the intraperitoneal cavity of mice that weigh 24 to 30 g. Animals must be separated randomly into 12 groups including positive and negative control groups.</p>
<p>3.	At day 2 after infection, tail blood samples must be taken for determination of parasitemia (it must be &gt;3%) before oral administration of test compounds at a volume of 10 ml/kg body weight.</p>
<p>4.	Each group of mice must receive the first dose of test compound after determination of parasitemia on day 2 after infection. Optionally, a second dose of drug would be delivered on day 3, 24 h after the first dose.  Optionally, a third dose would be delivered on day 4, 48 h after the first dose (depending on PK and efficacy of unknown compounds, single, two or three-day dosage for unknown compounds may be specified by the Government ahead of each service). Tail blood samples for determination of parasitemia will be taken on days 3, 5, and 7 post infection. If the parasitemia is between 0.5% and 3% on day 3 post infection then an additional blood smear should be performed on day 4.  After the 7th day, blood smears should be taken biweekly for 31 days. Mice that are blood film negative on day 31 post infection are considered cured.

<DESC>This procurement is for a Multiple Award Construction Contract (MACCs) and is being advertised as a 100% small business set-aside.  This procurement uses the two-phase design-build selection procedures and consists of one solicitation for each MACC covering both phases with the intent to award five or more Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) construction contracts to the responsible Offerors whose proposals, conforming to the Request for Proposal (RFP), will be most advantageous to the Government resulting in the best value, price and other factors considered.
 
This is an IDIQ contract with no pre-established fixed contract prices. The actual amount of work to be performed and the time of such performance will be determined by the Contracting Officer or his properly authorized representative, who will issue written task orders to the contractor.
Award of task orders will be on a firm fixed price basis. The work to be acquired under this solicitation is for new construction, renovation, and repair, by design-build or design-bid-build, of commercial and institutional building construction projects at various Government installations located in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. However, it is anticipated that the majority of the work under this solicitation will be performed in the Metro San Diego area, San Diego, California. Types of projects may include, but are not limited to: administration buildings, maintenance/repair facilities, aircraft control towers, hangars, fire stations, office buildings, laboratories, dining facilities and related structures.
The Metro San Diego area will cover Naval Bases San Diego, Coronado, Point Loma, and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 236220, and the annual size standard is $36.5 million. The basic contract performance period will be for 24 months. Each contract contains one (1) 36-month option for a total maximum duration of 60 months. The estimated maximum dollar value, including the base year and all options, for all contracts combined is $100,000,000. The only work authorized under this contract is work ordered by the government through issuance of a task order. Task orders will range between $500,000 and $7,000,000. Task orders may fall below or above this limit; however, contractors are not obligated to accept such task orders under the general terms of the contract.
The government makes no representation as to the number of task orders or actual amount of work to be ordered; however, during the term of the contract, a minimum of $5,000 is guaranteed to be ordered from each awardee, under the performance period of the contract. Contractors are not guaranteed work in excess of the minimum guarantee. 

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award contract(s) without discussions. Selection for award will be based on evaluation of the following: Phase One: Factor 1 - Technical Approach, Factor 2  Experience, Factor 3 - Past Performance, and Factor 4 - Safety; Phase Two: Factor 5 - Technical Solution, Factor 6 - Energy and Sustainable Design, and Factor 7 - Price (based on Proposed Task Order 0001).
Source Selection procedures will be used, and award may be made to the Offeror whose proposal is the most advantageous and offers the best value to the government, price and other factors considered. No site visit will be held, and no pre-proposal conference will be conducted. 

THE SOLICITATION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN ELECTRONIC FORMAT ONLY. The Phase One RFP will be posted on the Navy Electronic Commerce Online (NECO) website at https://www.neco.navy.mil and on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website at http://www.fbo.gov on or about September 17, 2018. No hard copies will be provided. IT IS THE CONTRACTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEBSITE DAILY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.
Prospective Offerors MUST register themselves on the website. Planholders lists will not be faxed and will be available only at the website listed above.

This action is being negotiated on a sole source basis with Communications and Power Industries, LLC, (CPI) in accordance with the statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition under Title 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) as implemented by FAR Part 6.302-1.  CPI is the designer and manufacturer of this item.  Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  The Government does not possess or cannot provide the data necessary to perform the required repairs of the item.
  Repair of the existing item requires a license to CPIs proprietary data and methods.

The time required for approval of a new design is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval; thus, award of the subject requirement may continue based on Fleet support needs.

The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, any capability statements received within fifteen days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government.
  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract action based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

The UHUD is a data display subsystem which receives power and signal inputs from aircraft subsystems. The UHUD provides the pilot with a visual display of weapon delivery and target information in both day and night operations. In addition, the UHUD also provides real-time simplified visual aids for normal flight operations. The UHUD displays flight information to the pilot by projecting an image from the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) onto the Combiner Assembly which is positioned in front of the pilot. This allows the pilot to maintain a forward-looking field of view through the Combiner Assembly. The projected image is focused at optical infinity so that the pilot does not have to refocus when viewing the image or the aircraft's surrounding environment. In the event of an electronics failure, the UHUD Projection Unit (PU) includes an electrically generated depressible standby aiming reticle to serve as a backup or emergency mode of operation.

The information received will be used within the Mission and Installation Contracting Command Center - Fort Sam Houston (MICC Center -FSH) to facilitate the decision making process and will not be disclosed outside of the organization.</p>
<p>This announcement is for planning and informational purposes only and SHALL NOT be considered an Invitation for Bid (IFB), Request for Quotation (RFQ), or Request for Proposal (RFP). There is no obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services described in this Sources Sought Synopsis. This office does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Sources Sought Synopsis or reimburse respondents for information solicited, and provided. No funds have been authorized, appropriated or received for this effort.</p>

The current Full Food Service requirement is being fulfilled though contract W9124713C0042. The Contractor shall provide quality services in support of the installation food service program that supports the Warfighter with flexible, efficient, and cost effective service. The service outlined in this requirement encompasses Full Food Services functions such as dining facility attendants, food preparation, facility sanitation and janitorial duties.</p>
<p>The NAICS code assigned to the acquisition is 722310, Food Service Contractors with a corresponding small business size standard of $38.5M. The Contractor shall provide all supervision, labor, personnel, equipment, materials, and supplies, with the exception of Government Furnished Property (GFP, expendables), to perform activities that comprise the full operation of an Army Dining Facility and Full Food Services.</p>
<p>PURPOSE OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT: To request information on capabilities of potential offerors to provide the services described herein to determine if this will be set-aside. Please note, FFS requirements are subject to both the priority established by the Randolph-Sheppard Act (RSA) and the preferences set out in FAR part 19.</p>
<p>-All offerors are hereby notified that this solicitation will be subject to the Randolph-Sheppard Act. The Army applies this priority in accordance with Army Regulation 210-25 (which will be incorporated into the solicitation and resulting contract). A priority right to operate dining facilities on federal property applies as defined in Army Regulation 30-22. This notice is not designed to discourage competition; rather, it sets out the priority established by the RSA for proposals received from State Licensing Agencies and their blind vendors.</p>
<p>A decision to set-aside this requirement for a small business program or to compete it through full and open procedures has not yet been made.</p>
<p>RESPONSES REGARDING POTENTIAL SOURCES STATEMENT OF CAPABILITIES: Interested Offerors having the required specialized capabilities / qualifications to support some or all of the work are asked to answer the following questions and submit a capability statement. Capability statements shall contain the following information:</p>
<p>1. Name of the firm, point of contact, phone number, email address, DUNS number, CAGE code, a statement regarding small business status (including small business type(s)/certifications(s) such as SDB, 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB, WOSB, etc.), and the corresponding NAICS code.</p>
<p>2. Identify whether your firm is interested in competing for this requirement as a prime contractor or not. Identify subcontracting, joint ventures or teaming arrangement that will be pursued, if any.</p>
<p>3. Information in sufficient detail regarding previous experience (indicate whether as a prime contractor or subcontractor) on similar requirements (include size, scope, complexity, timeframe, government or commercial), pertinent certifications, etc., that will facilitate making a capability determination.</p>
<p>4. Identify how the Army can best structure these contract requirements to facilitate competition by and among small business concerns.</p>
<p>5. Identify any condition or action that may be having the effect of unnecessarily restricting competition with respect to this acquisition. Please contact the MICC Advocate for Competition, Scott Kukes at scott.d.kukes.civ@mail.mil or 210-466-3015, if you believe that this action is unreasonably restricting competition. Include the subject of the acquisition, this announcement, and the MICC POC information from the FedBizOpps notice. Provide the specific aspects that unreasonably restrict competition and the rationale for such conclusion.</p>
