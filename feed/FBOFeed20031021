<DESC>The Department of the Interior, Minerals Management Service (GovWorks), intends to make a sole source award to Avtec Systems Inc. in the amount of $470,400.  This non-competitive action is being issued by GovWorks under the authority of the Department of Interior Franchise Fund on behalf of the Naval Research Laboratory.  This procurement is for systems engineering support by performing Functional Configuration Audits (FCA) of the various unique systems that comprise the Midway Research Center (MRC), Stafford, Virginia, and is a follow-on award to a uniquely qualified source.  Awarding the contract to another vendor at this point would most likely result in duplication of work, effort, time and cost to the Government.  To bring a new vendor in at this crucial time would impede the progress of the program; the learning curve for the new vendor would delay program completion by a minimum of 8 to 10 months and nearly double the cost. The intent of this synopsis is for informational purposes only. This is NOT a request for competitive quotes. However, all information received within five (5) days of this notice will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this action based on this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has a requirement to procure four hundred seventy (470) Transition Switch Modules (TSM),  logistic support, to include spare parts, associated testing, training, and contractor support services.  The TSM will replace the Marine Corps current Unit Level Circuit Switch (ULCS) equipment.  The TSM will provide commercially available circuit switching technology to replace the aging TRI-TAC family of equipment (AN/TTC-42 and SB-3865).  It will provide all of the services currently available in USMC switching equipment in a smaller, lighter package.  Additionally, the TSM will provide enhanced multiplexing capabilities and an Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) capability.  The TSM will provide a flexible Unit Level Switch capability that bridges legacy TRI-TAC switches with current commercial technology to provide Marine maneuver elements with more robust voice/data switching, data transport, and bandwidth management capabilities.  The TSM is anticipated to be a three transit case solution that will be fielded to all units that currently have a circuit switching capability (Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and Major Subordinate Command (MSC) through Regiment).  

Interested parties should submit a formal written request for the Request for Proposal (RFP) to the following address: COMMANDER, MARCORSYSCOM, 2200 Lester Street, CODE CTQIDP, ATTN:  I. D. Patterson, Quantico, VA 22134-5010

Per the Debt Collections Improvement Act of 1996, The Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFAR) requires all contractors to register in the Department of Defense (DOD) Central Contract Registration (CCR) Database.

<DESC>The Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis a contract under the authority of 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Agile Software Corporation for Agile/Oracle software maintenance and technical support for its proprietary configuration management software for the Radar Operations Center (ROC), Norman, Oklahoma.****Background:  The NEXRAD weather radar network is a Tri-agency (DoD, DoC, and DoT) funded and managed program.  The use of the Agile software has enabled the members of the Configuration Change Board (CCB) to efficiently manage and track all technical information pertaining to the NEXRAD weather radar system configuration.  In September of 1993, the Prime Contractor (Unisys) for the NEXRAD weather radar (then referred to as WSR-88D) delivered a database for Baseline Status Accounting.  The product delivered was a front end application entitled "CMStat" that ran on an Ingress database engine.  CMStat used a command line interface that was extremely difficult to use and poorly designed.  Over time, the poorly designed CMStat application began to function extremely slow and failed to meet additional criteria being demanded by the Tri-Agency.  In 1997 the ROC solicited bids for software to replace CMStat and Agile Software was awarded the contract.  In addition to the procurement of the Agile software, in January of 1998 the Agile Software Corporation was contracted to assist the ROC Configuration Management personnel to map the existing data from the CMStat database to the Agile database. This effort required hundreds of man hours to complete and test. An additional three months of dedicated staff hours were necessary to attach graphic files to the document object in the database and modify configuration management processes to the current status.  The ROC uses Agile software to manage technical drawings, technical manuals, Engineering Change Proposals (ECP), Engineering Change Orders (ECO), Configuration Change Requests (CCR), Document Change Request (DCR), Artwork Change Order (ACO), CCB member comments, and electronic approval for modifications to the NEXRAD radar system. All of the above listed documentation is contained within the application and may be viewed by any individual having access to the Agile server. The Agile client software gives the end user the ability to view any documents stored in the application even if the software that generated the document does not reside on the local PC.  The Agile software is an integral part of the ROC engineering process tracking and the primary tool used to manage the configuration of the NEXRAD weather radar system.****Requirements:  The ROC requires the delivery of all Agile server and client software upgrades and software patches that become available from the Agile Software Corporation.  The ROC requires that all delivered Agile software be compatible with the existing Agile/Oracle database schema and must maintain the current software functionality.  The ROC requires that all necessary Oracle server and client components and licensing be delivered with any Agile Software releases.  The ROC requires unlimited telephone technical support for Agile server and client software and Oracle server and client software (as it relates to Agile software) be made available, at a minimum, during normal business hours Monday through Friday.  
This procurement is being conducted per FAR Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures (under $100,000). FAR Clauses in full text are at http://www.ARNET.gov/far/. This synopsis is issued for information purposes only.  No competitive solicitation is planned. Questions should be submitted in writing to the contracting officer either by fax or email.  Any source that believes it can supply the required service should respond by submitting a written narrative statement of capability, including detailed technical information and other technical literature demonstrating the ability to meet the above requirements, within 15 days of this notice, to the above address.  Information submitted in response to the notice will be used solely to determine whether or not use of competitive procedures to fulfill this requirement would be in the Government's best interest and must address qualifications pertinent to this requirement.  Terms and Conditions and agency level protest procedures can be found on web site http://oamweb.osec.doc.gov/conops\#REFERENCE Hard copy in full test available from office address and phone number listed in notice.  Anticipated award date will be November 5, 2003.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Blvd. Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE: Arq. Alberto Sanchez-Aizcorbe, Executive President, Autoridad Autónoma del Proyecto Especial Sistema Eléctrico de Transporte Masivo de Lima y Callao, Calle Compostela # 142 - Urb. La Calesa, Santiago de Surco, Lima – Peru, Phone:  51-1 273-1944 / 273-2001, Fax:  51-1 273-2001 Anexo 100, Email: saizcorbe@hotmail.com.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to provide a Feasibility Study to the Autoridad Autónoma del Proyecto Especial Sistema Eléctrico de Transporte Masivo de Lima y Callao (Autonomous Authority) in the assessment of the technical, economic and financial viability of developing an urban rail project for the municipality of Lima.

Lima has grown into one of Latin America’s largest and most populous metropolitan areas.  Because the city is experiencing uncontrolled growth, and is in need of an adequately planned transportation system, Lima is suffering from severe air pollution and traffic congestion.  To address these consequences, the Autonomous Authority, a municipal transportation agency owned by the Metropolitan Municipality of Lima, is developing an integrated mass transit urban rail plan for the city of Lima.  The Autonomous Authority owns and manages concessions for the $312 million Lima train system. 

The present concept for the development of a rail system in Lima has focused on its development within the context of the overall urban and countrywide transportation network and calls the new project the "spinal column" of the Peruvian intermodal network, with an emphasis on its connection to the major cargo port of Callao just outside Lima.  The proposed project envisions the construction of a system of infrastructure and rolling stock that in the first stage will operate over two main axes: the first, from Callao on the Pacific to Chosica in the east, and the second from Villa El Salvador in the south to the center of the city. The southern line is not included in the Feasibility Study.  In the first stage, the east-west line will be upgraded only as far east as Vitarte, covering a distance of 26 kilometers.  While urban rail dates back to the 1960s in Lima, the Autonomous Authority is confident that the project will solve the transportation problems and will provide a more reliable, less polluting means of mass transit for its citizens.
 
The Autonomous Authority has requested U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) funding support for instituting urban rail passenger service on the Callao-Chosica corridor. The feasibility study would assess the economic and financial viability of offering both freight and passenger service on the existing right of way, given parameters for speed of operation, equipment capacity, station and equipment profiles and other engineering factors provided by the Autonomous Authority.  The study will place particular emphasis on station construction costs, traffic forecasting, equipment utilization, and financing costs.

The Terms of Reference for the Feasibility Study include the following: 

Task 1: 	Technical Analysis of Rehabilitation/Service Plan and Equipment Configuration
Task 2: 	Economic/Market Analysis
Task 3: 	Financial Analysis
Task 4. 	Environmental and Habitational Studies
Task 5: 	Supporting Legal- Regulatory Analysis
Task 6: 	Final Report

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $325,000 grant to the Grantee from the USTDA.

<DESC>POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009, ekunene@tda.gov. PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THE CONTRACTS OFFICE.  PROPOSAL SUBMISSION PLACE:  Ms. Davora Tancer; Head of Undreground Natural Gas Storage Project Team; INA-Industrija Nafte d.d. Zagreb; Subiceva 29; 10000 Zagreb, Croatia; Phone: 385-1-459-2129; Fax: 385-1-459-3063.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study examining the technical and economic feasibility of expanding INA’s current underground natural gas storage capacity.

Industrija Nafte d.d. Zagreb (INA), also known as INA Matica, is a joint stock company founded on January 1, 1964 when Naftaplin, an oil and gas exploration and production company (E&P), merged with the refineries of Rijeka, Sisak and Zagreb.  Presently, INA is a vertically integrated group of oil and gas companies comprising INA d.d., the parent company, and a number of wholly owned subsidiaries.

INA presently produces about 1.54 Bm3/y (billon cubic meters per year) of gas and imports 1.08 Bm3/y.  Of the 2.62 Bm3/y transported throughout the system, a portion goes into underground storage to balance out the demand requirements during the year.  INA plans to steadily increase its natural gas supply to the domestic market over the next few years to meet growing demands.  Additional natural gas from the offshore gas fields will be available to INA’s domestic consumers in 2005, after a new natural gas pipeline between Pula and Karlovac is constructed.  The new gas pipeline will connect offshore gas production facilities with the existing natural gas pipeline system in the northern part of the country.  INA anticipates an increase in the natural gas consumption to an annual rate of 4.0 Bm3 by the year 2010.  The residential sector’s gas consumption is expected to reach a market share of 30%. 

In a pre-feasibility study conducted by INA in 2002, they explored the possibility of expanding their Underground Gas Storage capacity.  The study considered four possible reservoirs for seasonal balance and three for possible daily balance.  INA estimated the investment required for each reservoir.  These investment estimates included:  cushion gas; wells; and facilities.  The preliminary results of the pre-feasibility study determined that the most promising field/layers were:  Okoli b2 and Okoli b4+5. 
  
The aim of the Feasibility Study is to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of expanding INA’s existing gas storage facility into the Okoli b2 and b4+5 layers of the existing Okoli field.  In addition, the Feasibility Study will include a review of the environmental impacts of the project as well as a financial analysis presented in a format that can be used to explore potential joint ventures, satisfy INA’s internal requirements and be satisfactory for initial applications to major international financial institutions such as the U.S. Export-Import Bank and EBRD.

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $290,000 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background definitional mission report are available from USTDA, at 1000 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 1600, Arlington, VA 22209-3901.

<DESC>SUBJECT: ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND ANALYSIS SERVICES (ECAS): TITLE I, TITLE II, AND OTHER ARCHITECT-ENGINEERING SERVICES TO ADMINISTER, COORDINATE AND TECHNICALLY SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS OF INTEREST TO THE GOVERNMENT

POC:  Ms. Helen Vaughn, Contracting Officer, (757) 764-7582, helen.vaughn@langley.af.mil; Mr. Mercer Hurst, Contracting Specialist, (757) 764-7581, mercer.hurst@langley.af.mil 
DESC:  NAICS 541330 (Engineering Services) applies to this acquisition, with a size standard of $4M.  Air Combat Command, Langley AFB, VA desires to contract with Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to perform Title I, Title II, and other A&E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support environmental programs of interest to Air Combat Command installations and other DoD agencies as requested by the agency and approved by HQ ACC/CEV and ACC CONS/LGC.    The work includes all efforts necessary to manage and execute Title I, Title II, and other A&E services primarily for environmental projects including restoration, conservation, planning, compliance, and pollution prevention.  The work also includes a secondary requirement for traditional A&E Services. 

Title I services include all aspects of design such as preparation of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, and preparation of operating and design manuals.  Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, operation, monitoring, topographic survey services and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems.

Title II services include supervision, inspection and oversight of environmental and traditional construction projects.  

Other A&E services include a full range of environmental and traditional services to include support necessary for the implementation of compliance, pollution prevention, conservation, and restoration environmental projects.  These efforts include planning and programming, program management, scoping, studies, operations support (including data gathering and permit preparation), investigations (including geophysical), evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, operation, monitoring, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems.  Also included are other related services for the continuation of an existing environmental program or to establish an initial environmental program.  The Contractor shall also provide a full range of management services associated with conventional design for construction of facilities of interest to the government.  These efforts include planning, programming, studies, investigations, interior design services, and other services not associated with a specific construction project.
These resulting contracts are the follow-on to the existing ECAS A&E services contracts.  A&E selection procedures will be used to competitively award seven (7) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  Four (4) of these contracts will be awarded as full and open competition.  Two (2) contracts will be awarded as competitive small business 8(a) set-asides and one (1) as HUBZone set aside.  The estimated program ceiling for all contracts awarded under this announcement is $200M.  There will be no individual task order amount limitation within the ceiling.  The minimum order amount guarantee for each contract awarded is $250,000.  
Each contractor must clearly state the choice of competition (full and open, 8(a) or HUBZone) in SF 255 Block 3.  An 8(a) and a HUBZone may compete under more than one category only if clearly stated in the SF 255 Block 3.  Each 8(a) and HUBZone shall submit only one proposal regardless of choice of competition.  Each proposal shall be evaluated only one time.   If no declaration is present, the submittal shall be evaluated under the full and open competition only.  Each contractor shall receive a maximum of one prime contract award.  
Each ID/IQ contract will have an ordering period of seven years ( 2004-2011) .  Individual task order performance per FAR 52.216-22 may extend 36 months beyond the ordering period (2014).  The basic ID/IQ contract will be structured to allow for the issuance of Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF), and Time-and-Materials (T&M) task orders with preference given to utilizing FFP to the greatest extent possible.

<DESC>SUBJECT: ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND ANALYSIS SERVICES (ECAS): TITLE I, TITLE II, AND OTHER ARCHITECT-ENGINEERING SERVICES TO ADMINISTER, COORDINATE AND TECHNICALLY SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRAMS OF INTEREST TO THE GOVERNMENT

POC:  Ms. Helen Vaughn, Contracting Officer, (757) 764-7582, helen.vaughn@langley.af.mil; Mr. Mercer Hurst, Contracting Specialist, (757) 764-7581, mercer.hurst@langley.af.mil 
DESC:  NAICS 541330 (Engineering Services) applies to this acquisition, with a size standard of $4M.  Air Combat Command, Langley AFB, VA desires to contract with Architect-Engineer (A&E) firms to perform Title I, Title II, and other A&E services to administer, coordinate, and technically support environmental programs of interest to Air Combat Command installations and other DoD agencies as requested by the agency and approved by HQ ACC/CEV and ACC CONS/LGC.    The work includes all efforts necessary to manage and execute Title I, Title II, and other A&E services primarily for environmental projects including restoration, conservation, planning, compliance, and pollution prevention.  The work also includes a secondary requirement for traditional A&E Services. 

Title I services include all aspects of design such as preparation of contract plans, specifications, scheduling, cost estimates, and preparation of operating and design manuals.  Title I efforts also encompass those efforts required to support and develop design work, including planning and programming, program management, project scoping, studies, investigations, evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, operation, monitoring, topographic survey services and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems.

Title II services include supervision, inspection and oversight of environmental and traditional construction projects.  

Other A&E services include a full range of environmental and traditional services to include support necessary for the implementation of compliance, pollution prevention, conservation, and restoration environmental projects.  These efforts include planning and programming, program management, scoping, studies, operations support (including data gathering and permit preparation), investigations (including geophysical), evaluations, consultations, conceptual design, value engineering, operation, monitoring, and optimization of environmental treatment or control systems.  Also included are other related services for the continuation of an existing environmental program or to establish an initial environmental program.  The Contractor shall also provide a full range of management services associated with conventional design for construction of facilities of interest to the government.  These efforts include planning, programming, studies, investigations, interior design services, and other services not associated with a specific construction project.
These resulting contracts are the follow-on to the existing ECAS A&E services contracts.  A&E selection procedures will be used to competitively award seven (7) indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ) contracts.  Four (4) of these contracts will be awarded as full and open competition.  Two (2) contracts will be awarded as competitive small business 8(a) set-asides and one (1) as HUBZone set aside.  The estimated program ceiling for all contracts awarded under this announcement is $200M.  There will be no individual task order amount limitation within the ceiling.  The minimum order amount guarantee for each contract awarded is $250,000.  
Each contractor must clearly state the choice of competition (full and open, 8(a) or HUBZone) in SF 255 Block 3.  An 8(a) and a HUBZone may compete under more than one category only if clearly stated in the SF 255 Block 3.  Each 8(a) and HUBZone shall submit only one proposal regardless of choice of competition.  Each proposal shall be evaluated only one time.   If no declaration is present, the submittal shall be evaluated under the full and open competition only.  Each contractor shall receive a maximum of one prime contract award.  
Each ID/IQ contract will have an ordering period of seven years ( 2004-2011) .  Individual task order performance per FAR 52.216-22 may extend 36 months beyond the ordering period (2014).  The basic ID/IQ contract will be structured to allow for the issuance of Firm Fixed Price (FFP), Fixed Price Incentive Fee (FPIF), and Time-and-Materials (T&M) task orders with preference given to utilizing FFP to the greatest extent possible.  The task orders will be used to direct performance of the required effort.  There will be no option periods for the basic contracts.  However, we do intend to use options at the task order level for recurring requirements.   Task Orders may be negotiated for multiple years and options exercised to implement out-year requirements.

Selection of the A&E firms for these contracts will be based on the following evaluation factors that are listed in priority order of importance: 

(1)	Specialized Experience.  SF-255, Block 8, list only current projects or projects completed in the past five years.  SF-255, Block 10 may be used to supplement project information.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/DCHA/OFDA) – henceforth OFDA – is charged with responding to both human-caused and natural disasters worldwide on behalf of the U.S. Government.   The training function within OFDA addresses preparation of OFDA staff for responsibilities in emergency response, managing grants to partner organizations for disaster response and mitigation, and coordination with other U.S. Government agencies.  OFDA also supports capacity building world-wide for emergency responders through its regional programs.   

OFDA Staff Training:  Training for staff and key partners in emergency response has long figured as an important function within OFDA.  The nature of OFDA’s work in the field does not vary significantly – however, the situations in which OFDA deploys assessment and response teams varies widely, so the training curriculum is flexible in order to incorporate evolving needs.  The Staff Training Unit is composed of four professional trainers (institutional contractors) and seeks to assure that: a) the curriculum is comprehensive and courses are balanced among OFDA performance needs; b) course delivery is high quality and interactive and that delivery mechanisms are diversified; d) training management is professional and transparent; and e) training is coordinated with Bureau, Agency, USG and other partners.

Regional Training:  Each OFDA region (LAC, Africa and Asia/Pacific) plans and manages its own training program, in all cases seeking to increase the capacity for emergency response in each country where OFDA works.  Generally, OFDA works with three major categories of partners: USG missions, international partners in emergency response, and local disaster response structures.  Training support mechanisms are in place in most regions.  

Worldwide Training Programs:  OFDA also runs or supports several worldwide training programs through several teams within OFDA, which the Training Advisor supports in a variety of ways.  They include a program on US Mission and inter-agency preparedness focused on Mission Disaster Preparedness Officers, and diverse technical training programs for NGOs such as public health, safety and security, or OFDA grant proposal writing.

<SUBJECT>A -- SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODE ARRAYS FOR THE MERCURY LASER FACILITY
<DESC>LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY
SEEKS PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY TO SUPPLY SEMICONDUCTOR LASER DIODE ARRAYS FOR THE MERCURY LASER FACILITY

The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), operated by the University of California under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), is seeking potential industrial partners and participants who are interested in, and capable of, supplying laser diode arrays in support of the Mercury laser project now underway at LLNL. The Mercury laser will be the first all diode-pumped inertial confinement fusion laser and will produce 100 Joules/pulse with an emission wavelength of ~ 1 µm. The current 23-bar LLNL arrays or “tiles” used on the system operate at an peak power of 2.3 kW at 10 Hz with an emission wavelength of 900 nm and 1ms long pulses. The tile consists of bars mounted on a silicon heatsink with microlens conditioning to reduce the divergence of the fast axis to 10 mrad.   

A primary objective is to produce high-power laser diode tiles in low cost packaging with LLNL supplying some of the bars for the laser diode arrays. For compatibility with our existing hardware, it is strongly recommended that the vendor deploy a technology resembling our V-BASIS package based on a silicon mounting platform mounted to a molybdenum base, fitted with a microlens array and the appropriate electrical connectors.  The use of the silicon mounting platform can result in a more efficient assembly process while maintaining very precise tolerances.  The LLNL technology permits the mounting of the diode lens in one operation instead of individually.  In addition, the precise tolerances of the etched silicon mounting platform prevents distortions from the “smile” problem, which results from the edge roll of the diode bar, and assure precise bar-to-bar alignment.

The ultimate choice of vendor will be based on competitive bids, and the vendor’s willingness to commercialize this product in the marketplace.  Such commercialization would require the negotiation of a license from LLNL to permit the commercial production and sale of the LLNL patented technology incorporated into the V-BASIS package.  Notice from Table 2 that the campaign is divided into three phases.

<SUBJECT>Intent to Procure Sole Source
<DESC>The VA Mid-Atlantic Healthcare Region (VISN6) Central Acquisition Service intends to procure sole source with Union Biomedica for a Copas Biosort System for the VA Medical Center in Durham, NC.   The system is the only system that can analyze, sort and dispense live model organisms while giving real-time readouts to identify/sort different populations based on size/length, optical density, and the presense of fluorescent markers.  Traditional flow cytometers use a large electrostatic charge to affect sorting, however this would be lethal to live organisms such as those being studied in the lab.  The Copas Biosort System will allow the lab to monitor these organisms and recover them after analysis which is an essential part of this program.   NAICS code 334516 applies to this procurement.  The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit quotations.  This notice of intent is not a request for quotations. Interested parties that believe they can meet these needs must supply information about their capabilities no later than 4:30pm EST, October 31, 2003.  All information shall be furnished at no cost or obligation to the Government.  This award will be made using simplified acquisition procedures.  No solicitation will be made available.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The anticipated award date is November 3, 2003.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Telephone or faxed inquiries will not be accepted.

Room 6028 (Board Room)
Washington, DC 20005
(Enter on G Street. Take elevator to the 6th floor. Closest Metro station is Metro Center.)

Registration
Interested software providers must register for the conference by November 10th, 2003 by e-mail with the attendee’s name, telephone number, and organization name to CIIS@kearneyco.com.  

Purpose
The purpose of the CDFI Software Developers Conference is to provide a forum for software providers serving the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) and/or Community Development Entity (CDE) industry to learn the details of the CDFI Fund’s reporting requirements so that they may modify or develop systems that CDFIs and CDEs use to track and submit the required data.

The CDFI Fund supports a network of more than 1,800 financial institutions. Approximately 400 of these are required to report annually to the CDFI Fund. The required data includes: a) institution-level data such as financial and organizational information; and b) detailed transaction-level data on each loan or investment in the institution’s portfolio. Transaction level data includes loan terms and status; borrower characteristics such as address, race/ethnicity and income; and community development impacts such as the number of affordable housing units developed or the number of jobs created.

The CDFI Fund has contracted with EF Kearney, Limited to design and develop a web-based system for CDFIs and CDEs to report the required data to the CDFI Fund. These institutions use a wide range of software products to track their data and in many cases use more than one software product to collect the different types of information required by the Fund.  There is a need for existing software products to be modified and/or new software products to be created to allow CDFIs and CDEs to easily track and submit each data element the Fund requires. At the Conference, the CDFI Fund and EF Kearney will present: 1) a list of the required data elements; 2) an overview of the data collection system; 3) system mapping; 4) methods of data interchange; 5) XML Dictionary and Schema; and 6) Technical Reference; and 7) Testing Opportunities. 

Background
A government corporation within the U.S. Treasury Department, the CDFI Fund was created in 1994 with the purpose of expanding the capacity of financial institutions to provide credit, capital and financial services to underserved populations and communities in the United States. The CDFI Fund accomplishes this mission by supporting a nation-wide network of CDFIs and CDEs.

CDFIs and CDEs are specialized, regulated and non-regulated, for-profit and nonprofit financial service providers whose primary mission is to fill service and credit gaps in underserved communities.  By successfully providing affordable financial products and services to distressed populations and communities, CDFIs and CDEs demonstrate the untapped market potential that exists in these communities and help to pull mainstream financial institutions toward these new markets. 

For more information on the CDFI Fund, CDFIs and CDEs, see the CDFI Fund’s website www.cdfifund.gov.

A new microwave system was designed to replace an ageing microwave system that is no longer supportable. This communications system is a critical link required to support strategic missions within the Pacific Northwest, including strategic submarine assets, flight operations, critical intelligence facilities, and regional telecommunications facilities. A large segment of the overall communications system was replaced several years ago with Harris microwave equipment. The Harris system uses a proprietary alarm and control system that will allow the newly proposed system to incorporate the current Harris system that has already been replaced. The Harris system will allow for a consolidated alarm and monitoring facility in an existing manned facility 7 X 24 which will provide for a rapid maintenance response to mission critical communications. There are currently eleven microwave links in use with factory trained technicians. The new microwave system must be provided with bulk encryption to provide for a secure communications path. This encryption equipment will be provided and installed by the Government after the new microwave system is installed and accepted. The Harris equipment has been tested and certified to work with the bulk encryption equipment already on hand. Existing and proposed Harris equipment is designed to be maintained without the need for specialized tools and test equipment which further reduces the overall operating cost to the Government. Due to the mission criticality and security requirements for the bulk encryption equipment, the Government desires to maintain the equipment in house and desires equipment that they are currently trained on. It is critical for the Government to be fully compatible with the Harris microwave equipment currently installed.

<DESC>The Marine Corps Systems Command (MARCORSYSCOM) has a requirement to procure four hundred seventy (470) Transition Switch Modules (TSM) to replace its current Unit Level Circuit Switch (ULCS) equipment.  The Transition Switch Module (TSM) will provide commercially available circuit switching technology to replace the aging TRI-TAC family of equipment (AN/TTC-42 and SB-3865).  It will provide all of the services currently available in USMC switching equipment in a smaller, lighter package.  Additionally, the TSM will provide enhanced multiplexing capabilities and an Integrated Services Digital Networks (ISDN) capability.  The TSM will provide a flexible Unit Level Switch capability that bridges legacy TRI-TAC switches with current commercial technology to provide Marine maneuver elements with more robust voice/data switching, data transport, and bandwidth management capabilities.  The TSM is anticipated to be a three transit case solution that will be fielded to all units that currently have a circuit switching capability (Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) and Major Subordinate Command (MSC) through Regiment).
