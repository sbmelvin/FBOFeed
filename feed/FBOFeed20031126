<DESC>NASA MSFC plans to continue their Site Licenses Agreement (SLA) to allow NASA MSFC to use existing Unigraphics Solutions (UGS) software for an additional one year as well as any software updates developed during the term of the SLA. The proposed SLA will provide up to 60 concurrent licenses at any given time to use UGS software, including iMAN, one license to use Parasolid, and up to 100 concurrent licenses at any given time to use Solid Edge. The SLA will not include any requirements for software installation, software maintenance; on-site technical support, consulting/implementation services (managed services) and training.  NASA MSFC plans to continue the SLA with Unigraphics Solutions on a sole-source basis pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.302-1. Competition is impractical for the following reasons:  1. Unigraphics is the only software compatible with Solid Edge, iMAN, and associated software currently used by NASA. iMAN is unique because of its features and expedient implementation of the Multidiscipinary Design/Analysis (MDA) system through built-in tailoring capabilities or a customizing toolkit. These features include, but are not limited to, an interface with a large commercial database, a 3D Master Model capability, modeling of the design process, external email notification to users of data availability and data transfer to and from design/analysis tools.	 2. To procure other software would not be cost effective because approximately 200 users currently trained in the use of Unigraphics, Solid Edge, iMAN and other associated modules would have to be retrained to use other software. In addition, a considerable number of software libraries and customized programs have been developed to interface and integrate with Unigraphics, Solid Edge, iMAN and other associated modules. Recreation of these libraries and customized programs to interface and integrate with any other applications would require a considerable amount of labor. The use of this software greatly enhances the design process by reducing the design cycle and interaction time. Aerospace Integrated Design Environments have documented better than 40-50% reductions in cost and labor hours. In the long term, lacking the demonstrated ability to reduce time and cut costs for the detailed design process, as well as the delay in technology development, will jeopardize the capture of future development projects.  3. UGS is the only source for the software and licenses. In order for any other supplier to furnish MSFC with the software and licenses, it would have to procure the same from UGS and simply increase the cost to NASA.  Interested firms have 15 days from the publication of this synopsis to submit in writing to the identified point of contact, their capabilities and qualifications. Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis. Responses received after the 15 days or without the required information will be considered nonresponsive to the synopsis and will not be considered. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government.  The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.  This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP).	All qualified responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.  An Ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B".

<DESC>NA The Army intends to modify an existing contract DAAD13-01-C-0009 with General Dynamics Robotic Systems (GDSR) on a sole source basis.  The modification calls for the upgrading of high pressure fuel pump assemblies on previously delivered M56 Smoke Generato r Systems (SGS) to the current improved configuration developed by GDRS.  Award of this work to a contractor other than GDRS would require an additional First Article Test for the upgraded high pressure fuel pump assemblies.  This delay would adversely imp act the Army fielding schedules for the retrofit of the M56 SGS.  It is anticipated that up to six hundred seventy-five (675) pump assemblies will be upgraded.  The new configuration pump assemblies will be installed by Government PM-Obscuration personnel in conjunction with the ongoing M56 retrofit program.  NOTE 22 applies.

This is a Corrected Pre-Solicitation Notice.  Two Phase design/build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED AS UNRESTRICTED. The acquisition is being conducted using full and open competition (unrestricted) and is therefore subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation clause 52.219-4, “Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hubzone Small Business Concerns”. This solicitation will result in award of the Multiple Award Construction Contract - III (MACC-III).  The MACC III may include up to five (5) Indefinite Quantity contracts with firm fixed price task orders to be placed thereunder.  The contracts are for a base year and three one-year option periods.  A set maximum amount has been established for each year, which includes up to $35 million for the first year, up to $20 million for the second year, up to $25 million for the year, and up to $20 million for the fourth year.  The total amount for all task orders issued during the four year term, regardless of the number of contracts awarded, will not exceed $100,000,000.  Task orders issued under this contract will range from $3,000,000 to $20,000,000; however, smaller and larger dollar value projects may be considered.  Future task orders will be competed only among the up to five successful contractors.  Award of each future task order may be based on either Best Value to the Government or low price.  Future task orders may require multi-disciplined engineering and design services in all aspects of construction for new and renovation projects.  Environmental engineering services, including analysis of requirements, preparation of permit applications and design may also be required.  All key professional disciplines shall be registered.  The work contemplated under this procurement will include new construction, alterations, renovations, maintenance, repairs, and the ability to do design build projects, but fully designed projects may also be competed under these contracts.  Projects may include asbestos/lead based paint removal, demolition, proprietary items and options. A significant number of design-build or performance based task orders may be placed under the resultant contracts.  The work under the MACC-III contracts will be concentrated in, but not limited to, Engineering Field Activity Northeast’s 10 state area of responsibility, which includes Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware.   It is intended to award up to five (5) separate Indefinite Quantity contracts encompassing a base period of 365 calendar days and three one year options which may be exercised by the Government during which separate task orders for projects will be placed.  The Government reserves the right to award up to five contracts under this solicitation or to award only one contract covering only the seed project identified under the solicitation.  The North American Industry Classification System, NAICS, Code of 236220, and the small business size standard is $28.5 million are applicable to the seed project.  Award of the seed project will be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal, conforming to this solicitation, is considered to be the most advantageous to the Government as a result of a Best Value evaluation with price and technical evaluation factors being approximately equal in importance.  Two-phase design-build Source Selection procedures will be utilized for this procurement.  The evaluation factors under Phase-One may include the following factors:  1) Relevant Past Performance; 2) Management Approach; 3) Technical Experience, Expertise, and Qualifications, 4) Commitment to Small Business Concerns, and 5) Safety Record.

<DESC>The Defense Distribution Center is soliciting offers to perform the physical distribution and warehouse operations to support Defense Distribution Depot Guam Marianas (DDGM) in the Territory of Guam. DDGM is located on Main Base, an 8,000 acre parcel which is part of the Navy Apra Harbor Complex.  The Depot is strategically located at the boundary between the Pacific Ocean and Philippine Sea, approximately 3,300 miles west of Hawaii, 1,400 miles southeast of Japan, and 1,250 miles east of the Philippines.  The Navy regional commander is Commander U. S. Naval Forces Marianas (COMNAVMAR) who is also U. S. Pacific Command (PACOM) Regional Coordinator and PACOM representative for Guam, Commonwealth of Northern Marianas Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.  Main Base is located 8 miles southwest of Hagatna (formerly Agana), the capitol of Guam and 11 miles southwest of Won Pat International Airport.  Andersen Air Force Base, located 20 miles northeast of Main Base, is Headquarters of the 13th Air Force and 36 Air Base Wing.  Andersen AFB provides military passenger and air cargo services to and from Guam.  DDGM operations include the full scope of physical distribution functions typically performed at Defense Logistic Agency managed distribution centers including receipt of Navy retail and wholesale replenishment receipts, processing of material turned into stores (MTIS), direct-turn-over and off-island transshipment, storage and care of stock in storage (COSIS), issue of retail and wholesale material, packing, shipping and local delivery.   The physical distribution operations are government owned and contractor operated (GOCO).

The government will be seeking industry comments on the DRAFT RFP as to the type of contract and Schedule B format.  The term of the contract consists of a three-year base period and a two-year option period.  The transition period to a successor contractor is expected to begin in the June/July 2004 timeframe with full operational capability by October 1, 2004.  The NAICS Code and Size Standard is 493110 and $21.5 million, respectively. A site visit and pre-proposal conference will be conducted at DDGM on a date to be determined.  Currently, the anticipated dates for the pre-proposal conference/site visit are January 17-18, 2004.  THESE DATES ARE NOT FIRM.  The dates will be published as part of the DRAFT RFP.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>This is a notice of contract action (NOCA) to advise all potential offerors that a Request for Quote (RFQ)is anticipated to be issued on 20 Nov 2003 as a Full and Open Competition requirement for:  The Engineering and Technical Support Branch of the Air Force Safety Center currently supports two Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance (MFOQA) demonstration projects.  These projects collect flight data recorder downloads and processes them through specialized computer software to uncover mishap precursors-- trends and deviations from standard procedures and parameters.  The analysis products are then available as guidance to operations, training, maintenance, safety, R&D, and design decisions 
Recent funding actions direct an expansion of the current demonstration programs and deployment of MFOQA into other airframes. Each additional airframe project requires tailoring to individual aircraft configuration and missions.  A multi-phase approach to the growth of MFOQA within the Air Force includes:
a.	Concept Validation-Determine MFOQA resource and process requirements.
b.	Development and Demonstration-Placement of resources and development of analyses.
c.	Targeted Analyses Development-Refinement of analyses, MAJCOM transition, and automatic report generation.
d.	Operational Integration.

The objectives of this task are to demonstrate long-range safety benefits of MFOQA programs by developing and integrating mishap precursor detection and mitigation tools into USAF aerial operations, and to reveal to the Major Commands the long-term value of MFOQA programs through additional applications in operations, training, logistics, acquisition, and maintenance.

Scope of Work.  This task involves validating the MFOQA concept throughout the Air Force, for a variety of aircraft configurations and missions.  Software enabling the MFOQA concept shall be developed, which will permit the analyst to identify standard procedures, deviations from standard procedures and parameter exceedances (often called the event set), perform statistical analyses, and to animate the flight data.  Flight data analysis products shall be presented to AFSC and the Major Commands, and used to keep the Air Force abreast of current safety, operational, training and maintenance trends in its flying community.  Regular communication between the contractor and Air Force personnel shall ensure current areas of interest, especially safety, operations, training and maintenance, are examined.  Monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual reports shall ensure the data is distributed to the greatest population possible.  An overall program manager will facilitate communication between the Air Force and the contractor(s), and will coordinate all software and hardware needs.  The technical supervisor will have the skills necessary to manage several large and perhaps varied databases and troubleshoot a variety of data analysis programs.  Software vendors may vary from program phase to program phase, and between aircraft.

<DESC>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) intends to negotiate with Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc., 8283 Greensboro Drive, McLean, Virginia 22102, for additional services on their existing contract.   HRSA's Contract Number 240-03-0007 was awarded to benefit and gather input for the National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Strategic Plan directly from the entities that would have to implement the plan.  This acquisition is for the contractor to organize, coordinate and conduct ten (10) regional meetings for awardees of the National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Program (NBHPPP)underTask 25.  The purpose of these regional meetings are threefold:  (1) present and gather input on the National Bioterrorism Hospital Preparedness Strategic Plan (NBHPSP) from the NBHPP Awardees, and regional experts; (2) facilitate discussions on regional planning 
and regional preparedness with purpose of further refining the Federal definitions of these strategic issues; and (3) provide a vehicle for exchange of information between  Federal and State, Territorial, and authorities.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc.,
is the only available source with the expertise and planning experience already tasked with assisting HRSA with fulfilling is mission to develop a national strategic plan of creating a national system for preparing the nation's hospitals against terrorism and outbreaks of infectious diseases.  Booz Allen Hamilton, Inc. presently provides HRSA and its State, Terroritorial, and Municipal partners with the subject matter 
expertise in the field of terrorism and healthcare preparedness planning.  As a result, the contractor has been privy to information and processes that are both sensitive and comprehensive in national, and if HRSA was required to expose a new contractor to the same information, it would significantly delay the full and comprehensive formulation of a seamless strategic plan and development of the national system.   Privilege information for organizing these meetings has been developed and maintain by Booze Allen Hamilton, which no other vendor has the rights to obtain.   Any other organization that attempts to retrieve this type of privileged information would have to replicate their previous accomplishments.    This replication would be a substantial duplication of cost that would 
be recovered through competition, therefore, Booz Allen Hamilton, is a responsible source without substantial duplication of cost to the Government under authority 41 U.S. C. 253 (c), (1) as set forth in FAR 6.302-1.  This is not a solicitation and published for information purposes only.  A copy of the Justification for Other Than Full and O pen Competition is on file.

1.0 Executive Overview

The ADRRS Program is comprised primarily of the following tasks, all of which relate to the Global Expeditionary Medical Systems (GEMS) software suite:
1)	Automatic Report Tool and Expert Surveillance Toolkit (ARTEST) for GEMS
2)	GEMS Theater Occupational Module (TOM) module nuclear, biological, chemical (NBC) event enhancements / Integration of TOM data set into the GEMS Patient Encounter Module (PEM) & Theater Epidemiological Module (TEM).
3)	TRANSCOM Regulating and Command & Control Evacuation System (TRAC2ES) Patient Movement Request (PMR) Integration into GEMS PEM. 
4)	Integration of a GEMS data subset into the DoD Electronic Medical Record Central Data Repository (CDR).

Due to the ever-increasing operational tempo and worldwide troop deployment profiles, the Surgeon General of the Air Force (AF/SG) has mandated that all deployed USAF Medical Service (AFMS) units have the capability to construct, archive and transmit Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), Occupational-Health-Exposure Records (OHERs) and Public-Health Records (PHRs).  Further, and most importantly, all of these items need to be monitored closely at both the unit and command levels for anomalies that may be indicative of a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) attack/exposure event.  The GEMS software application allows deployed medical units to 1) collect, process, store, retrieve and report patient encounter, occupational health-exposure and public-health data, 2) conduct epidemiological data surveillance on patient encounter data, and 3) subsequently allow senior leadership to make informed command and control decisions regarding deployed troop health and posturing in near-real time.

Per Air Force Tactics, Techniques and Procedures Manual 3-42.3, Health Service Support in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Environments, “Information provided by ongoing health surveillance and Disease and Non-Battle Injury (DNBI) reporting is critical to counter Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) attack (detection)”.  Further, they note that “health surveillance is likely to provide the first indication of attack”.  Accordingly, the continued and effective employment and enhancement of the GEMS software application suite is critical – as GEMS is the only DoD system that provides for electronic medical, occupational-health, and public-health records for deployed assets and near-real time surveillance of medical data.  Since NBC attack is more likely than ever per the “war on terror” and that health surveillance is likely to be the first – and perhaps only – indicator of an NBC event, this support is crucial.

Pursuant to the issues resulting from the Gulf War Syndrome, Public Law 105-85 Amendment to Title 10, Section 765, “Improved Medical Tracking System For Members Deployed Overseas In Contingency or Combat Operations” and DoD Directive 6490.2, “Joint Medical Surveillance”, directed routine medical surveillance of all military service members is to be conducted during active Federal service.  GEMS was developed to comply with these directives and to provide deploying AFMS units an interim software capability to construct an Electronic Patient Medical Record.

GEMS allows AFMS operational units to collect, process, store, retrieve and report patient encounter data; conduct epidemiological data surveillance; and make informed command and control decisions. 

The current version of GEMS was developed using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) software packages, database applications and custom software coding.  GEMS has been designed to operate on the Air Force Theater Medical Information Program (AF TMIP) hardware infrastructure. 

HQ ACC/SG, as the lead USAF Major Command (MAJCOM) agency, is responsible for requirement definition and validation.  HQ Standard Systems Group (SSG) is responsible for project management for GEMS 4.0 to include contract management for design, development, testing, and certification of the to-be-delivered GEMS updates with included ADRRS components

<SUBJECT>58--USMC NOTICE TO INDUSTRY REGARDING CAC2S AND MRRS
<DESC>The United States Marine Corps, Marine Corps Systems Command, Quantico, VA is tasked with providing Battlespace Management and Air Defense Systems.  Among those programs are the Common Aviation Command and Control System (CAC2S) and Multi-Role Radar System (MRRS).  Recent press reports regarding these two programs may be misleading to industry.  The Marine Corps would like to correct any misperceptions resulting from those reports.  CAC2S is a fully funded program and remains within cost, schedule and performance goals.  MRRS is a funded program to provide the warfighter with a single system capability for short-range air defense, medium range air surveillance, and air traffic control.  The US Army AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel Radar does not have the capability to meet all MRRS mission requirements; and therefore, was eliminated by the Marine Corps, as an existing single material solution alternative.  The BMADS Radar Program Office brief provided to Industry during the 9 June 2003 Radar Industry Day remains valid.

The services shall be in support of Shipyard availabilities.  It is essential that the proper skill level of painter be supplied for each individual order placed under this BPA.  Any delay to a shipyard availability due to inferior Painter services would be costly to the Government and is a primary consideration in the award and continuation of any resulting BPA.  The offeror(s) shall document their ability to supply Painters/Project Managers in accordance with the Required Technical Qualifications set forth as follows:  Required Technical Qualifications - The Painter/Project Manager must have a thorough knowledge of most phases of the painting trade relating to marine work in a shipyard, including theory and practice of the equipment, tools, materials, and supplies used. Must be thoroughly versed in marine trade methods and in the proper sequence of performing marine trade tasks. He must be able to operate all types of paint sprayers, suspend scaffolding and rigging, be familiar with primers, fillers, preservatives, rust preventatives, stains, oils, insulation materials, lacquers, enamels, epoxy paints and other various coatings, and the method of their application. Is expected to continually improve his knowledge and skill to keep pace with technological developments.  Proposal Preparation Instructions:  Technical Proposal:  The offeror shall submit a technical proposal that documents the qualifications of the Painters/Project Managers that they commit to supply under any resulting BPA.  A proposal that merely states that the Painters will meet all the requirements of the solicitation may be rejected as technically unacceptable.  Any offer submitted shall include details of the types of experience that will be supplied as Painters/Project Managers.  The proposal shall also include details that confirm that the offeror is capable of supplying as many as six (6) qualified Painters and a Project Manager within six (6) days of receipt of the order.  In addition, the proposal shall provide corroboration that Painters/Project Manager proposed will be providing their own personal respirator that has recently received a good fit-test.   Past Performance:  Offeror shall supply at least one (1) relevant marine shipyard recommendation for past performance evaluation purposes.  Price Proposal:  Offeror shall provide an hourly rate and overtime rate for the following labor categories:  PAINTER and PROJECT MANAGER.  The Government estimates that there will be a need for approximately 4,000 hours (3500 hrs/Painter, 500 hours Project Manager) of services required during the period of performance for this BPA.  This is not a firm commitment, conditions may change and there may be a need for significantly less or more hours.  Proposed rates shall be fixed and shall remain fixed throughout the period of performance.  Painters/Project Manager shall be entered into the Coast Guard YARD’s Time & Attendance system.  All services provided over eight (8) hours per day/forty (40) hours per week shall be considered overtime.  FAR 52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999) and the following addenda:  Proposal Evaluation: The Government will evaluate all offers to be qualified for award of a BPA as follows:  If it is determined in the best interest of the Government, the Government reserves the right to make more than one award in response to this solicitation.  The Government will review each proposal submitted in response to this solicitation and make award to the offeror who submits the best proposal for supplying personnel with the qualifications listed above.  The Government will consider price as a factor in the evaluation, but the contractor’s technical qualifications are more important.  Past Performance information will also be considered but it is less important than price.  Marine shipyard experience is required.  The experience will be evaluated for its relevancy and should be recent.  The evaluated price will be obtained by multiplying the estimated number of hours times the relevant labor category rate.  The two labor category totals will then be added together to achieve a final price for evaluation purposes.  The overtime rates will be multiplied by 500 for the painters and 100 for the supervisory painters.  The totals for those two categories will then be added to the total for the straight time rate to achieve a final evaluated price.  The Government reserves the right to make an award without discussions; FAR 52.212-3 Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items (Jun 2003) to include alt I (Apr 2002); these certifications must be included with quote.

This notice constitutes a BAA as contemplated by FAR 6.102(d)(2). TECHNICAL POC: Dr. Ray Meilunas  (301) 342-8064

I. INTRODUCTION.  The NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR) and the Polymers/Composites Branch of the Aeorspace Materials Division under the Air Vehicle Department (AIR-4.3) is soliciting proposals for research and development (R&D) concepts in the area of polymers and composite materials and structures to support current and future Naval Aviation needs. Concepts proposed may represent novel dedicated technologies and/or dual use of new emerging commercial technology. 

II. BACKGROUND.  
The mission of the Polymers & Composites Branch of the NAVAIR Aerospace Materials Division is to identify and pursue the most promising technologies within a broad spectrum of the science and engineering research communities and to develop, evaluate, and transition those technologies into NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS to impart new military capabilities. To this end, NAVAIR is soliciting proposals for advanced research and development in a variety of enabling technical areas as described below. Proposals may be either basic or applied research. Proposals that are not within the topical areas described below may be considered out of scope and not evaluated. Proposals that are not research, but rather integration of technologies or systems development will also be considered. Multiple awards are anticipated. The amount of resources made available to this BAA will depend on the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. While there is no specific requirement for cost and duration of the proposed effort, it is recommended that proposers include a Phase I of no more than 18 months in length that addresses the most critical issues on the path to success. This BAA constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort. No Proposer Information Pamphlet or other additional information will be published, nor will a formal request for proposal, or other solicitation, regarding this research and development be issued. Requests for same will be disregarded.

III. SPECIFIC AREAS OF INTEREST.   
New Materials, Materials Concepts, Materials Processing applied to polymers and composites. Specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: development and application of new and improved resins, structural reinforcing fibers, core and foam materials, adhesives, and sealants/coatings for naval aviation composite applications; new and/or lower cost manufacturing processes for structural composites (including tooling); process modeling; engineered materials for LO applications; high temperature resins/adhesives; structural and non-structural adhesives, Appliqué and paint replacement film materials, environmentally compliant surface preparations for bonding,  non-chromated and organic corrosion inhibitors for sealants and/or adhesives, novel approaches to toughened resins for prepregs and adhesives; Nanomaterials and structural nanocomposites, including carbon nanotubes; composite property/life prediction and related technologies; fracture phenomena of polymers & composites; galvanic corrosion ; Optical materials and coatings  for aircraft transparencies and their repair; self-healing, -sensing and -adapting polymers and composites; smart and adaptive (morphing) materials and structures; and structural and multifunctional (structure + function) materials; repair technologies;  biomaterials and biomimetic materials. Ideas outside of the advertised focused areas will be considered in scope provided they have the potential for radical improvement to national security and are within the interest of the office.

IV. CONTRACT/AGREEMENT TYPE.  NAVAIR is willing to consider various types of acquisition vehicles including, but not limited to, traditional FAR/DFARS type contracts and/or non-procurement agreements (e.g. Grants, Cooperative Agreements and Other Transactions).  Other Transactions will be entered into under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2371, and Section 845, Authority to Carry Out Certain Prototype Projects.  Information concerning Other Transactions can be found at http://www.darpa.mil/cmo/pages/other_trans.html and http://www.acq.osd.mil/ddre/research, or by contacting Julie A. Blew at (301) 757-8955 or by e-mail at julie.blew@navy.mil.  Final decision on acquisition type (contract/agreement) will be made by the government.

NOTE: Typically, research findings result in the need for additional services/supplies, which are not possible to anticipate or project.  Contract modifications may be executed to satisfy these requirements; thereby providing for flexibility in technology assessment (with technology transition the ultimate goal).  In the event that this is required, it shall be considered to be within the scope of this BAA and the resulting contract, and therefore will have met the requirements of the FAR/DFARS and the Competition in Contracting Act.

Organize Cost/Funding proposals in the following order: 
Total Project Cost: This section will give a detailed breakdown of costs of 
the project. Cost should also be broken for each task appearing in the Statement of Work and should include all of the proposed costs to the Government and, if applicable, cost shared by the offeror. Present the following information for each phase of the effort: total cost of the particular project phase; total offeror cost share, if applicable (mandatory for certain "other transaction agreements" see above); funding requested from the Government; and elements of cost (labor categories and applicable rates, direct materials, travel, other direct costs, equipment, software, patents, royalties, indirect costs, and cost of money). Sufficient information should be provided in supporting documents to allow the Government to evaluate the reasonableness of these proposed costs, including salaries, overhead, subcontractor proposals/quotes, equipment purchases, fair market rental value of leased items, and the method used for making such valuations. Profit should not be included as a cost element if the contract type to be awarded will be cost sharing. If the offeror elects to propose Cost Sharing and In-Kind contributions, please request additional proposal information from Vanessa Seymour, Contract Specialist at the address above. 

VI. EVALUATION CRITERIA. The government will evaluate proposals responsive to any or all of the areas of interest discussed herein. Proposals will not be evaluated against each other since each is a unique technology with no common work statement.  The primary evaluation criteria are: 

A.	Scientific and technical merits of the proposed research to include, (1) the degree to which proposed research and development objectives support the targeted technical topic and (2) validity of the technical basis for the approach offered; and

B.	The offeror’s capabilities, related experience, past performance on similar efforts, research investigators/personnel, facilities, techniques or unique combination of these which are integral factors for achieving the proposal objectives; and

C.	The realism and reasonableness of cost, including any proposed cost sharing. 

III. AWARDS.  NAVAIR is planning to make awards within the overall Program Objectives stated above (See para. II). All awards will be based on merit competition and availability of funding. The Government reserves the right to select all, some or none of the proposals received in response to this announcement.  Any awards are subject to the availability of appropriations.  There is no commitment by the Navy to be responsible for any monies expended by the offeror before award of a contract/agreement. For awards made as contracts, the socio-economic merits of each proposal will be evaluated based on the commitment to provide meaningful subcontracting opportunities with small business, small disadvantaged business, woman-owned small business concerns, and HBCU/MIs. If a full cost proposal is requested by the contracting officer, and the total exceeds $500,000, large businesses will be required to include a Small, Small Subcontracting Plan with its proposal package in accordance with FAR 52.219-9.

CENTRAL CONTRACTOR REGISTRATION (CCR)
Effective October 1, 2003, all vendors that do business with the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Federal Government must be registered in CCR.  Contractors are strongly encouraged to register with CCR now to avoid payment delays.  

Changes to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) require, among other things, that contractors be registered in the CCR before award of any contract, basic agreement, blanket purchase agreements, or basic ordering agreement can be made, and that contract payments and/or new awards will be conditioned on CCR registration.  The FAR change will also require that contractors with existing contracts that require performance after September 30, 2003, register in the CCR.  There are 5 exceptions to the CCR registration requirement, including purchases that use the government-wide purchase cards as the purchasing mechanism, certain emergency operations and urgent procurements, certain purchases where CCR registration could jeopardize national security, and awards to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States. 

The preferred method for completing a registration is via the World Wide Web at http://www.ccr.gov.  There, a CCR Handbook is available to provide detailed information on data you will need prior to beginning the on-line registration, as well as steps to walk you through the registration process.  You must have a DUNS number in order to begin your registration.  If you do not already have a DUNS number, please call Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., at 1-866-705-5711 or  610-882-7000. There is no cost to obtain a DUNS number.
