<SUBJECT>R -- Poverty Reduction by Increasing the Competitiveness of Enterprises

<DESC>The United States Government, represented by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Office of Acquisition and Assistance in Dhaka, Bangladesh, intends to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) to solicit proposals from qualified organizations interested in implementing the Poverty Reduction by Increasing the Competitiveness of Enterprises (PRICE) component, also referred to as a sub-activity, of USAID’s Economic Development and Growth with Equity (EDGE) activity.

USAID/Bangladesh acknowledges that a vibrant private sector is essential to economic growth and poverty reduction. Furthermore, USAID contends that in order to address Bangladesh’s daunting level of poverty, economic growth must be tempered with a focus on equity as outlined in the Government of Bangladesh’ Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). 

The PRICE sub-activity will be the principal mechanism by which USAID provides technical assistance to the private sector. The PRICE implementer will work in collaboration with various non-governmental organizations, and relevant Government of Bangladesh (GOB) ministries, including the Ministry of Commerce. The PRICE implementer will work with enterprises within three sub-sectors with the intention of promoting growth that is pro-poor and decreases the equity gap; increases access to new, profitable markets; leverages financing; improves workforce skills; expands the presence of embedded business development services; encourages applied research and increases the use of information and communications technology (ICT) as a productivity-enhancing tool.     

PRICE is one sub-activity of the USAID/Bangladesh’s broader Economic Development and Growth with Equity (EDGE) activity. To achieve broad-based economic growth requires effective engagement of the public and private sectors. Consequently, the EDGE activity consists of two, complementary implementation subactivities:

1.  Poverty Reduction by Increasing the Competitiveness of Enterprises (PRICE), 
2.  Policy Analysis, Monitoring and Assessment (PAMA).

PRICE is designed to ensure interventions support pro-poor economic growth. The PAMA sub-activity involves strengthening the development and reform of pro-poor and pro-business policies and regulations in Bangladesh. The PAMA and PRICE implementers will be expected to work in concert to ensure interventions are effective and measures to promote equity are adopted within each assisted sub-sector. Potential offerors are invited to go to http://www.usaid.gov/bd/files/edge_activity.pdf  (Proposal Information webpage of USAID/Bangladesh) for an extended narrative on the EDGE activity, its components and relevant background reports and studies.

The PRICE contract’s period of performance is expected to be five years with a total estimated cost of $11.5 million. USAID encourages the participation of small business concerns, small disadvantaged business concerns, and women-owned small business concerns as the prime contractor or as subcontractors in the implementation of this proposed award.     
 
The RFP is expected to be issued by mid-April 2006 and will be distributed through the Federal Business Opportunities website of the General Service Administration. Any amendments to this solicitation will be issued and posted on that website along with the RFP. Offerors are encouraged to check the FedBizOps website (http://www.fedbizopps.gov) periodically.

The United States Agency for International Development Mission to Indonesia (USAID/Indonesia) intends to solicit proposals from interested offerors for the construction and/or rehabilitation of approximately 240 kilometers of two-lane highway and numerous bridges from Banda Aceh to Meulaboh damaged or destroyed by the Indian Ocean Tsunami of December 26, 2004, in the Province of Aceh Nanggroe Darussalam.  Only U.S. construction firms will be eligible to bid on this anticipated Contract as a Prime Contractor.  USAID/Indonesia intends to issue a Indefinate Quantity Contract (IQC) for this highly visible, humanitarian reconstruction and rehabilitation project.  This procurement will be conducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of the U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  This notice is being placed pursuant to the requirements in FAR 36.213-2.  
Design of this road is presently underway and construction is intended to commence in September 2006 and should be completed within thirty two (32) months following the issuance of a Notice to Proceed.  The celine price for the Basic IQC has been estimated to be over $100 million U.S. Dollars.  Funding for the Project has been provided by the People of the United States of America through USAID/Indonesia.  
USAID/Indonesia will issue a Request for Proposals per the provisions of and procedures set forth in FAR Part 15. It is anticipated that the Request for Proposals for this IQC will be issued in early June 2006 with an RFP closing date in late July 2006.  The type of contract for this project will be fixed price and fixed unit cost contract.  USAID/Indonesia intends to use a combination of a lump-sum and unit-price contract pricing schedule based on the provisions set forth in FAR 36.207.
Interested bidders are encouraged to make maximum usage of Indonesian subcontractors, particularly those based in Aceh.  This award is not restricted to small businesses.  Plans and Specifications will be maintained by USAID/Indonesia located at the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia and at USAID/Indonesia’s offices in Banda Aceh and will be made available to interested bidders free of charge once they are ready.  Potential offerors are requested to register for this procurement once it has been released.

SOLICITATION NUMBER: 	263-06-502
ISSUANCE DATE:	05/21/2006
CLOSING DATE/TIME:	4:30 pm Cairo time on 07/02/2006
POSITION TITLE:	Regional Development Outreach & Communications Specialist
MARKET VALUE:	GS-14 
PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE:	2 years with possibility of extension. 
PLACE OF PERFORMANCE:	USAID/Cairo, Egypt
SECURITY ACCESS: 	Employment Authorization
AREA OF CONSIDERATION:	U.S. Citizens or U.S. resident aliens who are able to obtain the required security clearance.

Note: A candidate who is otherwise qualified, but does not meet full requirements of the position, may be appointed as a trainee and be required to serve at a lower grade level for the period of one year.

A. 	ORGANIZATIONAL LOCATION OF POSITION:
Although the position requires extensive travel to the Middle East, the incumbent residence will be in Cairo, Egypt.  Cairo is the largest city in Africa and the Middle East.  It has a number of urban problems such as severe pollution, and traffic congestion.  However, it is relatively crime-free and offers many cultural and recreational opportunities, including major museums, important historical sites, and most sports.  The Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea are easily reachable and provide opportunities for most water sports, especially snorkeling and scuba diving.


B.	POSITION TITLE OF DIRECT SUPERVISOR:
The Regional Development Outreach and Communications Specialist will be supervised by, and will report to, the Supervisory General Development Officer of the OMEP office (Office of Middle East Programs) at USAID/Cairo, Egypt.

C.	OVERVIEW:
The Regional Development Outreach and Communications (DOC) Specialist is located in the Office of Middle East Programs (OMEP) at USAID/Cairo.  The DOC Specialist reports to the Supervisory General Development Officer of the OMEP Office, but will have extensive interaction with the various USAID Mission Directors in the Middle East region, stretching from Morocco to Iraq.  S/he maintains regular contact and collaborates with the DOCs in bilateral USAID Missions and with relevant U.S. Embassy Public Affairs Officers (PAO) to ensure that Embassy personnel, including senior staff, are properly apprised of USAID regional public activities and projects.  S/he also serves as principal liaison with USAID’s Bureau for Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) in Washington (USAID/W).  

USAID manages over $1 billion of the U.S. Government (USG) development program across the Middle East region.  The USAID portfolio includes a broad range of economic growth, democracy, and social sector program activities.  

The Regional DOC Specialist supports USAID in the achievement of its objectives by producing and disseminating public information about regional Middle East activities for transnational and country-specific consumption, in collaboration with USAID bilateral Mission DOCs.  The Regional DOC is responsible for collecting, investigating, managing, and distributing information associated with USAID’s regional Middle East program.  The Regional DOC serves as OMEP’s primary point of contact and liaison for public and media information inquiries.  The Regional DOC also serves as the primary contact for USG interagency regional outreach and diplomacy efforts in the Middle East, and as the primary USAID outreach contact for USAID non-presence countries in the region.

USAID activities in the Middle East are complex and politically sensitive.  In this capacity, the incumbent is responsible for strategically planning, developing, implementing, and administering the regional DOC program to promote better awareness and understanding of United States foreign assistance to the region, along with related policies and achievements, among key audiences of the host country, in the United States, and throughout other donor countries.

D.	WORK DESCRIPTION:

Duties and Responsibilities of the Position	% OF TIME

b.  USAID Regional DOC Strategy:	         20%

The Regional DOC develops, reviews, and implements USAID's Middle East Communications Strategy, in coordination and consultation with the bilateral USAID missions’ outreach strategies.  The goal is to promote USAID’s new regional Middle East program to external and internal audiences, while also facilitating information access and sharing amongst the bilateral missions and regional program, and strengthening the missions’ reporting functions.  The Regional DOC also incorporates the USAID role in non-presence countries into the regional communications strategy.

An important aspect of this responsibility is for the Regional DOC to be a counterpart in USG interagency efforts for regional communications and diplomacy in the Middle East.  The Regional DOC will carry out a liaison role, as well as provide USAID input to interagency efforts, and to communicate back to other USAID missions and offices.

The DOC strategy should take into account the cost/benefits of particular inputs to outputs, to optimize communications tools and distribution to the broadest audiences possible.  The incumbent counsels OMEP on the selection, targeting, and placement of potential DOC materials in keeping with USAID's Strategy.

The DOC must also take into account the need to identify and focus on key sectors that have a natural appeal to local interest as well as USG policies; the importance of ensuring that publicity material used will be non-controversial; and that the material is visually appealing, well-defined, and contains a human interest element.  S/he will also be responsible for putting in place policies and procedures for OMEP communications that clarify roles and responsibilities within the USAID and inter-agency community, as well as with implementing partners, including templates for various communications tools, standards for creating and finalizing DOC materials, and guidelines for planning and managing events.

Coordinates signing ceremonies, inaugurations, and/or dedications of USAID regional projects, including drafting press releases for placement in the Middle East press and on the USAID homepage as well as coordinating with appropriate OMEP, other USAID, and inter-agency officials on logistics, schedules, guest lists, seating,  and other arrangements related to the events.

e.  Publicity Material:	                         15%
