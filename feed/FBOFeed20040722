<DESC>This is a pre-solicitation notice issued by the Architect of the Capitol to fabricate, deliver and install Architectural Models for the United States Capitol Visitor Center, Washingon, D. C. 

Seven architectural models for the exhibition gallery are being requested in this package. The largest and most prominent of the models is a 10-ft. tall, half-circle model of the Capitol dome, with an interior cut-away on the backside showing the interior architecture of the dome.  The remaining six models, each of equal size, show the area of Capitol square at six different historic periods, from 1800 to the present.  These models will include the Capitol as well as surrounding buildings within the specifically defined boundary lines.  All models must be historically and architecturally accurate to the detail specified in the description of each model.

Material used in the construction of the models can be suggested by the Contractor, but the large Dome model will be touchable and so must be able to withstand touching by large numbers of visitors with minimal cleaning and maintenance.  The six smaller models, because they will include landscaping features, will be under Plexiglas bonnets, which will be constructed by the Contractor to fit the bases being built by the exhibit fabricator.  Potential offerors are required to have at least 10 years of experience in the production of historic architectural models of like complexity as those described in the request for proposals.   The solicitation will be issued on or about 5 August 2004.  Requests for the solicitation package should be addressed to the attention of Rudy Philiposian, Procurement Analyst, email: rphilipo@aoc.gov, fax: 202-228-2073.  NOTE:  Please include your company name, address, point of contact, phone and fax number, and email address in your request for the solicitation package.

<DESC>NASA/MSFC has a requirement for Support of combustion devices design for Code T Lunar and Mars missions will require will require high fidelity, robust and accurate analyses. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) will be used to augment costly testing to evaluate Thrust Chamber Assembly (TCA) performance as well as thermal environments. The CFD codes must be capable of efficiently and analyzing three dimensional, multi-element injectors with all the accompanying geometric and physical complexities. The effort described in this Statement of Work (SOW) addresses this need by extending and enhancing the existing Loci framework for advanced unstructured CFD solvers. Although the tasks described in this SOW are general, the STREAM code is the current application of interest. NASA/MSFC intends to purchase the items from Mississippi State University Competition is impractical for the following reasons: 1.	The particular Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code being development builds on an existing framework called LOCI.  The goal of NASA/MSFC with this grant and the proposed companion grant, is to fully develop the LOCI framework with a pressure base code (LOCI-STREAM) to cover the broad fluid dynamic range that NASA needs.  Over the last couple of years, NASA/MSFC has been working to develop the pressure based code in the LOCI framework with the initial development of the code LOCI-STREAM.  This grant’s purpose is to continue that complex development of LOCI-STREAM by further development of the LOCI framework.   2.	The sole source is necessary because going to any other university will force the project to begin from scratch, wasting the previous work and delaying the project.  Everything would have to be duplicated and this project would not have the fund available to duplicate past work and get the objectives of this grant accomplished. 3.	Again, the development of a new CFD code and code framework is complex, time-consuming, and takes many different entities coming together to properly develop.  The work proposed under this grant is leveraging off of developments being currently proposed for LOCI-CHEM by other NASA Centers.  For this leveraging to work, all the NASA entities must use the same supplier, the university we are proposing to sole source to is the agreed upon supplier. 4.	NASA’s requirement is to ultimately develop a pressure based CFD code based in the LOCI framework that can properly analysis the complex flow in liquid rocket engines.  NASA is developing this code to be made available at no cost to all the US Rocket companies.  This sole source supplier is a university, which is willing to agree to this term. 5.	NASA has the requirement of inter-operable modules with another LOCI code (the pressure based code being developed in parallel) STREAM.  The sole source university already has a proven working relationship with the university developing LOCI-STREAM. The Government does not intend to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12.	 See note 22.   Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed.   Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>NASA/GSFC has a requirement for engineering expertise and knowledge of the processes used by Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) for technical developments in order to support the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) External Interface to ensure that correct interpretations are made for written and verbal communications between engineers and scientists in the U.S. and Japan.   JAXA is a partner with NASA for the GPM program. The partnership aggrangement calls for JAXA to provide a Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and launch services for the GPM core spacecraft.  NASA's contribution to the partnership includes the core spacecraft bus, a microwave radiometer and integration of all instruments, including the DPR, onto the core spacecraft.  Both countries will support the GPM Science Team.  As the lead partner NASA has overall responsibility for planning and to ensure Program success.  Engineering expertise and knowledge of the processes used by JAXA for technical developments is required to ensure that correct interpretations are made for written and verbal communications between engineers and scientists in the U.S. and Japan.  This procurement is to provide the GPM program with the necessary engineering expertise and knowledge of the processes used by both JAXA and NASA to help ensure that a mutually beneficial partnership is achieved between the U.S. and Japanese team members. NASA/GSFC intends to purchase this engineering support from TNK Space Corporation who is currently providing this support to the GPM program.

The Marine Operations Center – Pacific intends to procure for Simrad Brand name transducers and transceivers which are used throughout the NOAA Fleet for fisheries research.  The transducers must not be a “single ping” transducer, rather a Split Beam design that can identify the depth and intensity of bio-mass (fish) in the water column.  This acoustic tool for fisheries improves efficiencies over more traditional fish sample trawling, permitting much wider fisheries surveys to be conducted.  Simrad Brand name transducers are also required for NOAA to maintain consistency and to continue fisheries data acquisition and analytical evaluations.   Three frequencies (38, 120, and 200 kHz) are used for acoustical species identification and target strength estimation.  Simrad is the only known manufacturer of a split-beam scientific echosounder system that provides a simultaneous 1kW transmission at four frequencies, and a stable 140 dB re 1W receiver dynamic range, quadrature sampling, and both system control and data output via Ethernet.  These features are required for compatibility with existing survey hardware and for data comparability with historical surveys.  These features must be compatible with existing survey hardware (data logging and processing hardware and software, and hull mounted transducers with 60 Ohm input impedance).   

Delivery date will be no more than 30 days from date of contract award.  This procurement is a 100% small business set-aside.  All responsible, responsive offers will be considered.  The NAICS code for this procurement is 334511 and the size standard is 750 employees.  Interested offerors may identify their interest and capability to respond to this requirement in writing to Kristina Loesell, NOAA, WASC, 7600 Sand Point Way NE, Seattle, WA 98115, or via email at Kristina.M.Loesell@noaa.gov This notice may represent the only official notice of the intended contract award.

The DOE/AL intends to award the following line items:  The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has experienced significant costs in time delays in missions critical to the Administration and the Department of Energy attributable, in part, to the length of time now taken for access authorization requirements.  In an effort to reduce the time element currently experienced in the process without introducing unacceptable national security risks, AL has researched the market for potential tools that could provide a rapid assessment of an individual?s trustworthiness, reliability, and responsibility relative to lifestyle, work history, behaviors, and counterproductive or illegal behaviors.  Such a tool could be used in conjunction with elements of current investigative requirements to mitigate national security risks in granting interim access authorization while awaiting receipt of expedited special security background investigations.  Computer Employment Applications, Inc., has developed a proprietary automated, interactive, computer-based interview DOS application containing interview modules that would, with some modification and module expansion, satisfy our DOE requirements for coverage of and individual?s life and history relative to the Questionnaire for National Security Positions and the criteria by which DOE determines eligibility for access authorization.  The services required are the modification of the existing system and use of the proprietary system in a six-month pilot test mode on a limited NNSA population of access authorization applicants.           The government will not except any cost proposal for the acquisition for this GSA purchase.

These digitizers convert analog video from the ASR-7 and ASR-8 radars along with the analog transponder information provided by the ATCBI-4 and ATCBI-5 beacon interrogators to a digital format so that the aircraft identification and location can be displayed on the newer display terminals that require a digital input.  The FAA intends to solicit and negotiate only with Sensis Corporation, DeWitt, NY in accordance with AMS Policy 3.2.2.4.  They are the only source capable of providing the spares in the time required. The TDX-2000 is proprietary to Sensis Corporation.  As such, the FAA does not possess the specifications to this equipment to allow other vendors to supply these spare parts.  Sensis has specialized test equipment and specifications to ensure this equipment is manufactured correctly and working to their specifications.  This announcement is for information purposes only, not a request for proposals.  Point of contact: Connie M. Houpt, 405/954-7820.

<DESC>The project is a continuation of Phase I of a four-phase program to renovate an 18-story office building.  Approximately 80,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated cost range is $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  Completion time is 196 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about July 19, 2004.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the bi-state Kansas City region consisting of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray; (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 15 and 16 and various return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 15 and 16 will be vacant.  Base Bid contract work includes tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; minor amounts of ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; tenant signage; redistribution of existing above ceiling HVAC; new, and relocation of, existing lighting fixtures; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Base Bid also includes shell work consisting of patching and preparing concrete floor slab for finishes, demolition and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts at the 15th and 16th floors, installation and finishing of new shaft walls at the 15th and 16th floors, and installation of new transformers.  Option Bid work includes minor modifications in rest rooms and vending rooms; installation of epoxy terrazzo and base, vinyl wall covering and carpet; and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage 2 will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications and price are approximately equal.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan Approach.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  After all proposals have been ranked according to their technical quality, price proposals will be opened and separately ranked.  The two separate ranks will be averaged together into a single total rank and the offeror with the highest total rank will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, completed drawings and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWF file.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on Wednesday, April 14, 2004, at 9:00 a.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  Proposals will be received in on Thursday, May 6, 2004, at 2:00 p.m, local time.  Specific location is specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will evaluate submissions to establish those within a competitive range.

Proposals submitted should be acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph the may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  

The RFP specification and Construction Documents are available by link via this announcement.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.  Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.  Contact Karen Poole, Contracting Officer, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4920 or fax her at 816-823-5935.  Technical questions should be directed to the Project Manager, George Gourse, at 816-823-2262.

DMAPS connects over 42 legacy systems and utilizes the DMAPS IE to connect the DMAPS suite of and the interfaces from the legacy systems to which enhances the depot maintenance processes, which improved visibility of material costs needed for decision-making in financial management. The DMAPS evolution involved extensive software modernization, development and integration.   The advancement of the DMAPS Suite moves AFMC closer to CFO compliance.  There is a plan for software modifications required to make DMAPS to a large extent CFO compliant.  We are looking to maintain DMAPS while providing the CFO improvements.

TRADITIONAL MEASURES OF POVERTY ARE BASED ON INCOME: IF INCOME IS BELOW A GIVEN THRESHOLD, THEN THE FAMILY IS DETERMINED TO BE POOR.  MANY ANALYSTS HAVE NOTED THAT THE CURRENT DEFINITION OF INCOME USED TO DETERMINE POVERTY STATUS FAILS TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION MUCH OF OUR NATION'S INCOME SUPPORT SAFETY NET - TRANSFERS FROM SUCH PROGRAMS AS FOOD STAMPS, HOUSING AND TAX CREDITS ARE NOT CONSIDERED IN THE OFFICIAL POVERTY MEASURE.  SOME ANALYSTS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT A FAMILY'S WELL-BEING IS BETTER MEASURED BY THEIR TOTAL SPENDING RATHER THAN THEIR TOTAL INCOME. THAT IS, SOME FAMILIES CAN HAVE A SECURE AND SATISFACTORY STANDARD OF LIVING WITHOUT HAVING HIGH INCOME. THIS MAY BE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE FAMILY CAN SUPPORT CONSUMPTION BY HAVING HIGH ASSETS. IN ADDITION TO MEASURES OF POVERTY BASED ON ECONOMIC MEASURES THERE ARE ALSO A RANGE OF NON-ECONOMIC MEASURES OF WELL-BEING THAT FOCUS DIRECTLY ON THE INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY OR HOUSEHOLD'S PHYSICAL, SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING - SUCH AS MEASURES OF HOUSING SECURITY, SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS, AND FOOD SECURITY.

GIVEN THAT IT WAS A NEW PROGRAM WITH LITTLE LEGISLATIVE SPECIFICITY, ORHP FOUND THAT ADMINISTRATION OF THE PROGRAM NEEDED TO BE FLEXIBLE OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIRST THREE YEARS.  IN FY 2004, CONGRESS AGAIN AUTHORIZED FUNDS TO CONTINUE MAKING GRANTS TO THE DELTA REGION. AS A RESULT, ORHP REVISED, UPDATED, AND REWROTE THE DELTA NETWORK PROGRAM GUIDE BASED ON LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE PROGRAM.  NEW AWARDS FOR ANOTHER THREE-YEAR CYCLE WILL BE MADE IN SEPTEMBER 2004.

PURPOSE:


THE PURPOSE OF THIS ACQUISITION IS TO OBTAIN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH PHASE 2 OF THE DELTA STATES RURAL DEVELOPMENT NETWORK GRANT PROGRAM.  THIS CONTRACT WILL PROVIDE DELTA STATES GRANTEES A VALUABLE SET OF NEW TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED TO SUCCESSFULLY FIND AND APPLY FOR GRANTS AND OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT CAN HELP THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF DELTA COMMUNITIES. 


THE CONTRACTOR SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE EIGHT AWARDED DELTA STATES GRANT PROJECTS AND COMMUNITIES BASED ON ONGOING ASSESSMENT OF THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS AND GOALS.  THIS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROJECT WILL ASSIST COMMUNITIES IN LOCATING AND COMPETING FOR OTHER FEDERAL, STATE, AND PHILANTHROPIC GRANT OPPORTUNITIES.  


THE RURAL HEALTH POLICY CENTER (RHPC) OF THE PENN STATE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IS RECOMMENDED TO PERFORM THE DESIRED SCOPE OF WORK.  THEY ARE UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO CARRY OUT THESE ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF THEIR PRIOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS WITHIN THE OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH POLICY, THEIR EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE OF A WIDE ARRAY OF FEDERAL, STATE, AND PHILANTHROPIC FUNDING SOURCES AND THEIR DIRECT WORKING EXPERIENCE WITH THE DELTA STATES ON OTHER PROJECTS.

SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:


THE RURAL HEALTH POLICY CENTER (RHPC) HAS SERVED AS THE NATIONAL PROGRAM OFFICE OF THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION'S SOUTHERN RURAL ACCESS PROGRAM SINCE 1997.  THE SOUTHERN RURAL ACCESS PROGRAM GRANTEES AND PARTNERS HAVE PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE DELTA STATES PROGRAM.  SINCE 2002, THE RHPC HAS ALSO SERVED AS A SUBCONTRACTOR UNDER A GEORGIA HEALTH POLICY CENTER CONTRACT TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO BOTH THE DELTA STATES RURAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE RURAL HEALTH NETWORK DEVELOPMENT GRANT PROGRAMS. THIS ORGANIZATION HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE DELTA STATE GRANTEES AND OTHER KEY RURAL HEALTH PARTNERS IN ALL EIGHT OF THE DELTA STATES.  FROM 2002-2004, THE RHPC STAFF PLAYED IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP ROLES IN PLANNING CONFERENCE CALLS AND CONVENING OF WORKSHOPS FOR DELTA STATES GRANTEES. THEY HAVE CONSIDERABLE EXPERTISE AND A POSITIVE TRACK RECORD IN HELPING RURAL HEALTH AGENCIES LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESOURCES.  THE RHPC STAFF HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE DELTA SATES PROGRAM SINCE 2001 AND HAS A DEEP UNDERSTANDING BOTH OF ITS INITIAL THRUST AND HOW IT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.  

BECAUSE OF THEIR VAST KNOWLEDGE OF RURAL HEALTH AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO RURAL POPULATIONS, PAST SUCCESS IN CARRYING OUT FEDERALLY FUNDED RURAL PROJECTS AND A WORKING KNOWLEDGE OF THE DELTA STATES RURAL DEVELOPMENT NETWORK GRANT PROGRAM, THE RURAL HEALTH POLICY CENTER (RHPC) OF THE PENN STATE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IS THE SOLE ORGANIZATION CAPABLE OF SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETING THIS PROJECT.

<DESC>SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES

DATE: JULY 22, 2004

REQUISITION NO: 04M000211

INTENDED SOURCE: AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF OPIOD DEPENDENCE (AATOD)

PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE: DATE OF AWARD THROUGH TWELVE MONTHS

PURPOSE:

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN  SERVICES, SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION, CENTER FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT, THROUGH THE PROGRAM SUPPORT CENTER, PLANS TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION TO THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF OPIOD DEPENDENCE. CLOSING DATE IS AUGUST 5, 2004.

THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROCUREMENT IS:

BACKGROUND:

EXPERIENCE WITH THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESSES IN INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS SUGGESTS THAT DRUG USERS COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS CAN BE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED BY LINKING MEDICAL CARE SERVICES WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT SERVICES.  LINKAGE OF DRUG ABUSE TREATMENT WITH INFECTIOUS DISEASE SERVICES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE INTEGRAL TO ADDRESSING INFECTIOUS DISEASE COMORBIDITIES ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. OTP'S HAVE RECOGNIZED THE EFFICACY OF CO-LOCATION OF SERVICES. BASED ON THE RECENT SAMHSA DASIS SURVEY OF OTP'S, 73.3% OF PROGRAMS NATIONWIDE PROVIDE SOME FORM OF HIV TESTING SERVICE. LINKAGE OF HEALTH CARE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE FRAMEWORK FOR TREATING CO-OCCURRING INFECTIOUS DISEASES, SUCH AS HIV INFECTION OR TUBERCULOSIS. HIV TESTING AND KNOWLEDGE OF HIV SEROSTATUS REMAINS A KEY STEP IN BRINGING A CLIENT TO HIV CARE AND SERVICES. THE HIV RAPID TEST (ORAQUICK RAPID ANTIBODY TEST) ADVANCES ACCESS TO CARE AND TREATMENT BY PROVIDING TEST RESULTS WITHIN MINUTES IN ONE PROGRAM VISIT DURING WHICH THE PATIENT IS TESTED, RECEIVES TEST RESULTS AND APPROPRIATE COUNSELING.      

THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION APPROVED THE ORAQUICK RAPID HIV-1/2 ANTIBODY TEST, MANUFACTURED BY ORASURE TECHNOLOGIES, INC., BETHLEHEM, PENNSYLVANIA, ON NOVEMBER 7, 2002, FOR DETECTION OF ANTIBODIES TO HIV-1 IN BLOOD.  THE TEST KIT CAN BE STORED AT ROOM TEMPERATURE;  THE BLOOD TEST REQUIRES NO SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT; AND IT CAN QUICKLY AND RELIABLY DETECT ANTIBODIES TO HIV-1. THE RESULTS OF RAPID TESTS ARE REPORTED IN THE OTP OR POINT-OF-CARE SETTING WITH RESULTS PROVIDED IN APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES. THE ORAQUICK RAPID HIV-1/2 ANTIBODY TEST FOR USE WITH BLOOD WAS CATEGORIZED AS A WAIVED TEST UNDER CLIA (CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENTS AMENDMENTS OF 1988) IN JANUARY, 2003. A WAIVED TEST SYSTEM CAN BE GIVEN IN FACILITIES WITH ANY CLIA CERTIFICATE. AS SUCH, A TEST CATEGORIZED AS A WAIVED TEST CAN BE USED IN OTP SETTINGS BY MANY DIFFERENT HEALTH PROVIDERS WHO ARE TRAINED TO PERFORM THE TEST AND PROVIDE HIV COUNSELING. IF THE ORAQUICK TEST GIVES A REACTIVE TEST (POSITIVE) RESULT THAT RESULT MUST BE CONFIRMED WITH AN ADDITIONAL MORE SPECIFIC HIV TEST CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY THE OTP. 

THE ORAQUICK RAPID HIV-1 ANTIBODY TEST HAS ALSO BEEN APPROVED FOR THE USE OF ORAL FLUID SAMPLES WITH A RAPID HIV DIAGNOSTIC TEST KIT THAT CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED 99.3 OF SPECIMENS FROM INFECTED PEOPLE (SENSITIVITY) AND 99.8% OF SPECIMENS FROM UNINFECTED PEOPLE (SPECIFICITY) IN LIMITED STUDIES PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURER IN SUPPORT OF THIS APPROVAL. IN ADDITION TO SIMPLIFYING THE TESTING PROCESS, PRECLUDING THE NEED FOR A BLOOD SAMPLE, USE OF THE ORAL COLLECTION COMPONENT REDUCES RISK TO HEALTHCARE WORKERS PERFORMING THE TEST BY REDUCING EXPOSURE TO BLOOD AND SHARPS. THE DEVICE HAS AN EXPOSED ABSORBENT PAD AT ONE END, WHICH IS GENTLY SWABBED AROUND THE MOUTH BETWEEN THE TEETH AND THE OUTER GUMS. IT IS THEN INSERTED INTO A VIAL CONTAINING A SOLUTION. IN AS LITTLE AS 20 MINUTES, THE TEST DEVICE WILL INDICATE WHETHER HIV-1 ANTIBODIES ARE PRESENT IN THE SOLUTION BY DISPLAYING EITHER ONE BAR (THE CONTROL INDICATOR, SHOWING A NEGATIVE HIV RESPONSE) OR TWO BARS (THE CONTROL PLUS REACTIVE TEST INDICATOR) IN A SMALL WINDOW ON THE DEVICE.  TWO BARS INDICATE A PRESUMPTIVE POSITIVE RESULT, REQUIRING A WESTERN BLOT TEST TO CONFIRM HIV INFECTION.
THIS TEST IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION TO BE CATEGORIZED AS A WAIVED TEST UNDER CLIA. IF GRANTED, THEN OTP'S WOULD HAVE THE OPTION TO UTILIZE ETHER BLOOD OR ORAL FLUID TO PERFORM THE HIV RAPID TEST. 

	APPROPRIATE TRAINING OF OTP STAFF (COUNSELORS AND NURSES) AT PERFORMING THE HIV RAPID TEST AND PROVIDING POST-TEST HIV COUNSELING MAY HELP AVOID INFECTION IN PATIENTS NOT INFECTED (PRIMARY PREVENTION) AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, MAY HELP IN SECONDARY AND TERTIARY PREVENTION AND IN THE REFERRAL TO TREATMENT. 
	
OBJECTIVES:

	THE PURPOSE OF THIS PURCHASE ORDER IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IMPLEMENTING THE HIV RAPID TESTING IN OTPS.  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS DIAGNOSTIC TOOL IN OTPS IS EXPECTED TO ENHANCE THE IDENTIFICATION OF PATIENTS WITH HIV INFECTION THROUGH DECREASED "LOST-TO-FOLLOW-UP" NOTIFICATION OF SEROSTATUS. THE ENHANCED IDENTIFICATION AND NOTIFICATION OF CLIENT SEROSTATUS WILL PROMOTE THE EFFICACY OF MANDATED HIV PREVENTION COUNSELING IN OTPS. ENHANCED PREVENTION EFFORTS FOR CLIENTS THAT ARE HIV POSITIVE REDUCES HIGH-RISK BEHAVIORS AND HIV TRANSMISSION TO NONINFECTED INDIVIDUALS.  ENHANCED NOTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE HIV POSITIVE WILL INCREASE REFERRALS TO PRIMARY CARE FOR HIV AND TREATMENT OF INFECTED PATIENTS. THIS WILL ENHANCE COLLABORATION AND INTEGRATION OF SERVICES BETWEEN METHADONE CLINICS AND HIV CLINICS. 
		
STATEMENT OF WORK:

GENERAL REQUIREMENTS:

THE CONTRACTOR SHALL FURNISH THE NECESSARY FACULTY, PERSONNEL, FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES, AND PERFORM THE WORK SET FORTH BELOW.

ALL REPORTS, STATISTICS, CURRICULA, SYLLABI OR TABLES PRODUCED UNDER THIS PROJECT SHALL BE THE PROPERTY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH INCLUDES THE CENTER FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (SAMHSA).  SAMHSA OR CSAT MAY UTILIZE, PRINT, OR DISSEMINATE SUCH MATERIAL WITHOUT FURTHER CHARGE.  

	
	SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
	
	THE CONTRACTOR SHALL INCLUDE CSAT AS A SPONSOR OF THE HIV RAPID TEST IMPLEMENTATION AND IN THAT CAPACITY UNDERTAKE THE FOLLOWING TASKS:
	
	TASKS:

	5.  THE CONTRACTOR SHALL PROVIDE CSAT WITH 2 COPIES OF THE REPORT ON
	EVALUATION INSTRUMENTS AND A SUMMARY OF THE EVALUATION RESULTS.  



 SOLE SOURCE DETERMINATION IS BASED UPON THE FOLLOWING:

SAMSHA IS CARRYING OUT A 3-YEAR HIV RAPID TESTING INITIATIVE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF PUBLIC LAW 102-321. THIS STATUTE CREATED SAMHSA "TO IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF TREATMENT AND RELATED SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH RESPECT TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL ILLNESS AND TO IMPROVE PREVENTION SERVICES, PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND PROTECT THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUBSTANCE ABUSERS." IN ADDITION, TITLE V, PART A, SEC. 501 (D) (4) OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE ACT (42 U.S.C. 290AA) REQUIRES SAMHSA TO "CONDUCT AND COORDINATE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS, EVALUATIONS, AND SERVICE SYSTEM ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO IMPROVE THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF TREATMENT, PREVENTION AND RELATED SERVICES."   GIVEN THE ROLES ASSIGNED TO SAMHSA UNDER THESE STATUTES, SAMHSA HAS LAUNCHED THIS INITIATIVE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL TO ALLOCATE SOME $6 MILLION THIS FISCAL YEAR TO DISTRIBUTE HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) RAPID TEST KITS, TRAIN PERSONNEL TO ADMINISTER THE TEST, AND TO EVALUATE THE DISTRIBUTION, USE, RESULTS AND IMPACT OF THIS TESTING REGIME. IT IS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HIV TESTING. SAMHSA MUST ALSO PROVIDE FOR TRAINING THE TREATMENT PROGRAMS THAT CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TESTING PROGRAM, AS DESCRIBED IN THE FDA RESTRICTIONS FOR SALE OF THE TEST KIT. 

THERE ARE A 1,108 OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES REGULATED BY THE DIVISION OF PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES (DPT) IN THE CENTER FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT, AT WHICH A LARGE NUMBER OF INTRAVENOUS DRUG USERS WHO ARE AT GREAT RISK FOR HIV INFECTION ARE TREATED FOR OPIOID ADDICTION. AN EFFORT IS BEING MADE TO TRAIN AT LEAST 2 STAFF MEMBERS IN EACH OF APPROXIMATELY 700 OTPS WHICH ARE EXPECTED VOLUNTEER TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HIV TESTING PROJECT. DPT EXPECTS THAT ONCE STAFF MEMBERS ARE TRAINED OTPS WILL PROVIDE COUNSELING AND TESTING SERVICES TO SOME 35,000 OR MORE PATIENTS PER YEAR USING THE RAPID TEST KITS DURING THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT.  THERE IS ALSO A NEED TO CONDUCT A SMALL AND ELEGANT BUT EFFICIENT EVALUATION OF THIS EFFORT. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF THIS EFFORT IS $85,000.  

THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE (AATOD) IS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE SOURCE OF THESE EVALUATION SERVICES. THERE IS A CONSTANT TURNOVER OF OWNERSHIP AND STAFFING OF OTPS, AND AATOD MAINTAINS VERY CLOSE CONTACTS WITH THE OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS (OTPS) IN THE UNITED STATES AND IS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THESE PROGRAMS DESPITE THE CONSTANT CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AND STAFFING.  IT IS THE ONLY NATIONAL OTP-ORGANIZATION, REPRESENTING OTP ORGANIZATIONS IN 18 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.  THE ASSOCIATION ALSO FREQUENTLY REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN NON-MEMBER STATES. IT IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION THAT HAS THE INFLUENCE, VISIBILITY AND NOTORIETY TO OBTAIN PARTICIPATION OF OTPS IN DISTRIBUTING TEST KITS AND IN EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE TESTING PROGRAM. THIS ASSOCIATION HAS THE TRUST OF THE TREATMENT FIELD AND HAS ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED THE CONTACTS AND INFLUENCE, NOT ONLY WITH THE OPIOID AGONIST TREATMENT FIELD, BUT ALSO WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES AND LEADERS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD AND IN THE HIV PREVENTION, TREATMENT AND TRAINING ORGANIZATIONS.  THE ASSOCIATION HAS ALSO WORKED SUCCESSFULLY WITH DEVELOPING MEDICALLY FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS AND PROJECTS IN THE PAST. IT IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION THAT CAN ELICIT THE PARTICIPATION AND COOPERATION OF A LARGE NUMBER OF OTPS TO MAKE THIS TESTING EFFORT A WIDE SUCCESS.

IT IS THE ONLY ORGANIZATION WHICH ACTUALLY REPRESENTS THE ORGANIZATION
WHICH HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR THIS PROCUREMENT;

IT HAS UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEEDS OF OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND THE
PATIENTS TREATED IN THEM;

IT HAS UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE OF THE ISSUES WHICH FACE OTPS AND THE TYPES OF
INFORMATION WHICH MUST BE COLLECTED TO DISTRIBUTE TESTING KITS AND TO
CONDUCT THE EVALUATION DESCRIBED IN THE PROCUREMENT;

IT HAS THE CAPACITY TO MAINTAIN AN ACCURATE AND UP-TO-DATE LIST OF THE
NAMES AND LOCATIONS OF RAPIDLY CHANGING OTPS AND THEIR MANAGEMENT THAT
ARE NEEDED TO CONDUCT REQUIRED FOLLOW UP;

IT HAS AN ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIP WITH CSAT THROUGH THE OPIOID TREATMENT
PROGRAM ACCREDITATION AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WHICH ALLOWS IT TO
UNDERSTAND THE SAMHS MISSION AND TO HAVE A CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF CSAT'S
REQUIREMENTS;

IT HAS ESTABLISHED MECHANISMS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH AND ELICITING
COOPERATION FROM OTPS, THEIR MANAGEMENT AND THE PATIENTS TREATED IN OTPS;

IT HAS ENGAGED IN COLLABORATIVE PROJECTS WITH OTHER DIVISIONS WITHIN CSAT
AND SHARED THE INFORMATION TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ADDICTION
TREATMENT WITH OPIOIDS.

AATOD'S MISSION INCLUDES SUPPORTING THE LEGITIMACY OF METHADONE MAINTENANCE AS A VALUABLE TREATMENT FOR OPIOID DEPENDENCE; INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN NEED OF CARE; ORGANIZING THE TREATMENT COMMUNITY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES; UPHOLDING THE STANDARDS OF QUALITY, COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT FIRST DEVELOPED BY DRS. NYSWANDER AND DOLE IN THE MID-1960S (WHO INITIALLY CONDUCTED THE RESEARCH WHICH DEMONSTRATED THAT METHADONE WAS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR OPIOID ADDICTION), AS REFLECTED IN AATOD'S ETHICAL CANON.  AATOD HAS WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES TO ASSIST ITS MEMBERS TO IMPROVE THE FIELD OF METHADONE TREATMENT AND TO COMPLY WITH THE SAMHSA'S NEW OPIOID TREATMENT REGULATIONS FOUND IN 42 CFR PART 8.  AATOD HAS PROVIDED TRAINING TO OPIOID TREATMENT PROGRAM STAFF ON A VARIETY OF COGENT TOPICS, FROM HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) TO HEPATITIS B AND C PREVENTION AND TREATMENT.  AATOD HAS LONG SUPPORTED COUNSELING AND TESTING FOR HIV AND HAS WORKED TO REDUCE HIGH-RISK BEHAVIORS ON THE PART OF PATIENTS RECEIVING TREATMENT FOR OPIOID ADDICTION. THE ASSOCIATION'S MISSION IS TO WORK FOR POSITIVE CHANGE IN THE FIELD OF OPIOID AGONIST TREATMENT, FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF HEALTHCARE IN FACILITIES, FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR PATIENTS, INCREASING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE TREATMENT SYSTEM, AND GREATLY REDUCING THE STIGMA OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIELD. THE ACTIVITIES OF THE ASSOCIATION SHALL BE LIMITED TO THOSE OF AN ORGANIZATION DEFINED UNDER 26 U.S.C. SECTION 501(C)(3).   

AATOD CURRENTLY HAS THE MANAGEMENT CAPABILITY AND EXPERTISE IN PLACE AND IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL.  THE ASSOCIATION ALSO HAS A REPUTATION FOR WORK PRODUCED VERY ECONOMICALLY.

<DESC>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) intends to award on a competitive basis under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (dollar threshold of $100,000) for Consulting Services.  The Simplified Acquisition Procedures are set aside for small businesses unless there are no small business available.  The Level II of the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) is a standardized coding system that is used primarily to identify products, supplies, and services not included in the CPT-4 codes.  For example, ambulatory services and durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) are identified by these codes when used outside a physician’s office.  Because Medicare and other insurers cover a variety of services, supplies and equipment that are not identified by CPT-4, Level II codes were established for submitting claims for these items.  The HCPCS National Panel has been in existence since 1978, and has been responsible for managing the national HCPCS Level II permanent codes.  The National Panel is currently responsible for making the final decisions pertaining to modifications to the HCPCS codes. The National Panel, which consists of members from America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBSA), and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), jointly reviews all requests for coding changes and makes final decisions regarding the annual update to the national codes.  In October of 2003, the Secretary of HHS delegated authority under the HIPAA legislation to CMS to maintain and distribute HCPCS Level II Codes. In an attempt to provide a fair and equitable system for the modification process of the HCPCS Level II code set, it is crucial that we capture a balance of input from both public (i.e. Medicare and Medicaid) and private insurers.  There is a need to retain representation from the private sector to ensure that the operating needs of all payers are met.  In order to retain efficient coordination among national third party payers, we are soliciting proposals from the current members of the panel, as well as other national third party payers.  Proposals for consultants to the CMS HCPCS workgroup will be accepted from interested parties that meet all of the following criteria: (a) a representative employee(s) of a national third party payer; (b) knowledge of all aspects and impacts of modifications to the National HCPCS Level II Code System;(c) insight into the needs of internal and external customers and users of codes;(d) extensive medical coding expertise; and (e) an organization with a system in place that would facilitate the processing of “S” (primarily used by the private sector) codes. Contractors seeking an RFQ package must be provide capability statements applicable to the above requirements.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>Availability of a prospectus for solicitation of offers to operate commercial visitor services within Virgin Islands National Park (St. John).  The operation will include watersports activities on a year-round schedule at Caneel Bay Resort.  Gross revenues over the past three years have averaged approximately $400,000 annually. The term of this contract is expected to be 10 years, and will require a minimum franchise fee to be paid to the National Park Service of four percent (4%) of gross revenue per year. The Director, pursuant to 36 CFR 51, has determined that this is a qualified contract, within the meaning regarding determination of a preferred offeror, because gross receipts are not expected to be greater than $500,000 in the first year of the contract. Therefore, there is a preferred offeror for this contract and all offers will be evaluated according to the terms set forth in the Prospectus.  Offers must be received by close of business at 4:00 p.m. on September 20, 2004. The Prospectus will explain the business opportunity, the terms and conditions under which the NPS will award the concession contract, the proposal instructions, and the proposal package (including the selection factors). There will be an administrative charge to recoup printing cost of $30.00 plus a $5.00 mailing fee for each prospectus. Please make checks for $35.00 payable to the National Park Service. Include a physical address (not post office box) and telephone number. All requests for prospectuses should be made in writing to Henry Benedetti, Chief, Commercial Services, National Park Service, AFC, 1924 Building, 100 Alabama Street, S.W., Atlanta, GA  30303. No telephone requests for the prospectus will be honored. Please note that no further information than that provided above is available through any other internet resources or links. Concession contracts are not contracts within the meaning of 41 USC 601 et seq. (The Contract Dispute Act) and are not service or procurement contracts within the meaning of statutes, regulations or policies that apply only to federal service contracts or other types of federal procurement actions.

The technical approach will in clude an integrated master plan and schedule for construction that describes the Offeror's technical approach for executing the work.

However, the Government also reserves the right to enter into discussions if deemed necessary, and if discussions are conducted the Offerors will be afforded the opportunity to revise their proposal.

DOCUMENT SECURITY - NOTICE TO PROSPECTIVE BIDDERS/OFFERORS:

This solicitation includes Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information.  SBU documents provided under this solicitation are intended for use by authorized users only.  In support of this requirement, GSA requires bidders/offerors to exercise reasonable care when handling documents relating to SBU building information per the solicitation.

REASONABLE CARE:

1.	Limiting dissemination to authorized users.  Dissemination of information shall only be made upon determination that the recipient is authorized to receive it.  The criterion to determine authorization is need-to-know.  Those with a need-to-know are those who are specifically granted access for the conduct of business on behalf of or with GSA.  This includes all persons or firms necessary to do work at the request of the Government, such as architects and engineers, consultants, contractors, sub-contractors, suppliers, and others that the contractor deems necessary in order to submit an offer/bid or to complete the work or contract, as well as maintenance and repair contractors and equipment service contractors.

NOTE:  It is the responsibility of the person or firm disseminating the information to assure that the recipient is an authorized user and to keep records or recipients.

Authorized users shall provide identification as set forth below:

	Valid identification for non-Government users.  Authorized non-Government users shall provide valid identification to receive SBU building information.  The identification shall be presented and verified for each dissemination.  Valid identification shall be all items (a) through (c), below, and including item (d), as necessary.

(a)	A copy of a valid business license or other documentation granted by the state or local jurisdiction to conduct business.  The license at a minimum shall provide the name, address, phone number of the company, state of incorporation, and the name of the individual legally authorized to act for the company.  The business must be of the type required to do the work.  A general contractor's license may be substituted for the business license in states that issue such licenses.  In the rare cases where a business license is not available from the jurisdiction, the information shall be provided and testified to by the submitter; and   

(b)	Verification of a valid DUNS Number against the company name listed on the business license or certifications.  Verification may be obtained through http://www.fpdc.gov, or by calling Dun & Bradstreet at 703-807-5078 to set up an account; and 

(c)	A Valid IRS Tax ID Number of the company requesting the information; and, as necessary, 

(d)	A Valid picture state driver's license shall be required of person(s) picking up SBU documents.  Phone verification must be made to a previously validated authorized user that the individual(s) picking up the documentation is authorized to do so by the company obtaining the documents.  SBU documents will not be released to any individual or firm who has not, either previously or at the time of pickup, supplied the required documentation as outlined in paragraphs (a) though (c), above.

2.	Retaining and destroying documents.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of the contract and for whatever specific time thereafter as may be necessary.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning or shredding hardcopy, and/'or physically destroying CD's, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

3.	Term of Effectiveness.  The efforts required above shall continue throughout the entire term of contract and for what specific time thereafter as may be necessary, as determined by the Government.  Necessary record copies for legal purposes (such as those retained by the architect, engineer, or contractor) must be safeguarded against unauthorized use for the term of retention. 

4.	Written agreement of disposal.   For all contracts using SBU building information, the contractor shall provide a written statement that he and his subcontractors have properly disposed of the SBU building documents, with the exception of the contractor's record copy, at the time of Release of Claims to obtain final payment.  Documents no longer needed shall be destroyed (such as after contract award, after completion of any appeals process or completion of the work).  Destruction shall be done by burning, or shredding hardcopy, and/or physically destroying CDs, deleting and removing files from the electronic recycling bins, and removing material from computer hard drives using a permanent erase utility or similar software.

The recipient acknowledges the requirement to use reasonable care, as outlined above, to safeguard the documents and, if not awarded, the contract (and at the completion of any protest/appeal process) will make every reasonable and prudent effort to destroy or render useless all SBU information received during the solicitation.

I agree that I will abide by this agreement and will only disseminate Sensitive But Unclassified (SBU) building information to other authorized users under the conditions set forth above.

Approximately 80,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated cost range is $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  Completion time is 196 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about July 19, 2004.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the bi-state Kansas City region consisting of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray; (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 15 and 16 and various return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 15 and 16 will be vacant.  Base Bid contract work includes tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; minor amounts of ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; tenant signage; redistribution of existing above ceiling HVAC; new, and relocation of, existing lighting fixtures; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Base Bid also includes shell work consisting of patching and preparing concrete floor slab for finishes, demolition and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts at the 15th and 16th floors, installation and finishing of new shaft walls at the 15th and 16th floors, and installation of new transformers.  Option Bid work includes minor modifications in rest rooms and vending rooms; installation of epoxy terrazzo and base, vinyl wall covering and carpet; and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage 2 will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the soand price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications and price are approximately equal.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan Approach.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  After all proposals have been ranked according to their technical quality, price proposals will be opened and separately ranked.  The two separate ranks will be averaged together into a single total rank and the offeror with the highest total rank will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, completed drawings and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.

Approximately 80,000 gross square feet of the 1.2 million gross square foot building will be renovated in this project.  Estimated cost range is $2,000,000 to $4,000,000.  Completion time is 196 calendar days after receipt of Notice to Proceed, to be issued on or about July 19, 2004.  This contract is restricted and limited to only those firms having (1) an existing general construction contracting office as of the date of this announcement within the bi-state Kansas City region consisting of the Kansas Counties of Johnson, Leavenworth and Wyandotte; and the Missouri Counties of Cass, Clay, Jackson, Platte and Ray; (2) a hazardous materials abatement subcontractor whose on-site supervisors for this project possess the Supervisor / Missouri State Certificate for Asbestos Related Occupations and their most recent required refresher training certificate; and (3) a data wiring subcontractor whose on-site supervisor for this project has been certified by Building Industry Consulting Services International, Inc. (BICSI).

This project will be limited to floors 15 and 16 and various return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  The building will be occupied during construction, however floors 15 and 16 will be vacant.  Base Bid contract work includes tenant improvements consisting of new drywall partitions; minor amounts of ceiling replacement; new doors, frames and hardware; paint, plaster, and vinyl base; casework; tenant signage; redistribution of existing above ceiling HVAC; new, and relocation of, existing lighting fixtures; floor box connections for office furniture; new panel boards; and telephone and data raceway and drops.  Base Bid also includes shell work consisting of patching and preparing concrete floor slab for finishes, demolition and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts at the 15th and 16th floors, installation and finishing of new shaft walls at the 15th and 16th floors, and installation of new transformers.  Option Bid work includes minor modifications in rest rooms and vending rooms; installation of epoxy terrazzo and base, vinyl wall covering and carpet; and asbestos abatement in building return-air shafts and pipe chases from floors 11 through 18.  Any contractor or subcontractor performing asbestos abatement shall satisfy special competencies and provide bodily injury liability insurance written on the comprehensive form of policy of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence.  Such coverage must encompass liabilities arising from work with the hazardous materials involved.  The Government will not indemnify against such risk.  Construction work that is disruptive to the tenants and building operations must be completed outside of normal business hours.

This is a competitive negotiated acquisition using source selection procedures.  Proposals will be evaluated in two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of technical evaluations.  Stage 2 will consist of price evaluations.  Offerors must submit their technical proposals and price proposals at the same time, but in separate packages.  The Government intends to use the “trade-off process” in selecting the prime contractor.  The “trade-off process” is a method of evaluating price and other related factors specified in the solicitation, with the goal being to select the proposal that is most advantageous to the Government in terms of both technical qualifications and price.  For this procurement, technical qualifications and price are approximately equal.  Award will be made to the responsible offeror whose offer conforms to the solicitation and provides the combination of technical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical echnical qualifications and price most advantageous to the Government.

The Government will evaluate all proposals.  Two factors will be considered - technical qualifications and price.  The elements that make up the technical evaluation factors, in order of importance, are (1) Past Performance of the Firm, (2) Qualifications of Key Personnel, and (3) Management Plan Approach.  Proposals will first be ranked according their technical quality.  After all proposals have been ranked according to their technical quality, price proposals will be opened and separately ranked.  The two separate ranks will be averaged together into a single total rank and the offeror with the highest total rank will be considered the most advantageous.  If the ranks of two or more offerors are equal, the higher technical proposal will be the offer considered most advantageous.

The Request for Proposal (RFP) will include a general scope of work, completed drawings and specifications, the Solicitation Provisions, the Proposal Submittal Requirements and the Evaluation Factors.  In an effort to safeguard sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information, the General Services Administration is participating as a pilot agency in the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS).  GSA, PBS, Property Development Division, Administrative/Procurement Services Branch (6PCA), will no longer mail hardcopies of construction solicitations and amendments.  The solicitation (specifications and drawings) and its amendments will only be available through a link in FedBizOpps to the Federal Technical Data Solution (FEDTeDS) website.  Note that registration in FEDTeDS requires as a prerequisite current registration in CCR.  Vendors seeking business opportunities with the General Services Administration must first register with CCR (www.ccr.gov <http://www.ccr.gov>) and then with FEDTeDS (www.fedteds.gov <http://www.fedteds.gov>).  As the General Services Administration implements FEDTeDS, solicitations will continue to be available through the government-wide point of entry (www.FedBizOpps.gov) but the sensitive but unclassified acquisition related information (specifications and drawings) will only be available through links to FEDTeDS.  The drawings are being provided as .DWF file.  Drawings can be viewed from Autodesk.  Bidders are responsible for producing their own print sets for their use.   

Effective October 1, 2003, all government contractors must be registered in CCR prior to receiving an award.  At minimum, all vendors must supply the following information: 

1.	Your Company's Central Contractor Registration (CCR) Marketing Partner Identification Number (MPIN) which you should obtain from your Company's CCR Point of Contact, 
2.	Your Company's DUNS Number (800-333-0505 if you do not have one) or CAGE Code 
3.	Your Company’s Tax ID Number, 
4.	Your Telephone Number, and 
5.	Your E-Mail Address.  

Any questions regarding this notification should be directed to the Contracting Officer or Contract Specialist whose name appears herein.

Your CCR registration should take approximately 48 hours for processing and activation.  Once you have registered with CCR you may then register with FEDTeDS to view solicitations.  No federal materials can be downloaded until you have registered under both sites.  You may register with FEDTeDS via the following URL https://www.fedteds.gov/.  If you have not used the site previously, please go to "Register with FedTeds" and read the Vendor User Guide.  The official planholders list will be based on only those requesting specifications through FedTeDS. 

There will be a Pre-Proposal Conference on Wednesday, April 14, 2004, at 9:00 a.m., local time, in room N133 of the Richard Bolling Federal Building, 601 East 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri.  Proposals will be received in on Thursday, May 6, 2004, at 2:00 p.m, local time.  Specific location is specified in the RFP.  Only one proposal may be submitted by each offeror.  The Government will evaluate submissions to establish those within a competitive range.

Proposals submitted should be acceptable without additional explanation or information, as the Government may make a final determination regarding a proposal’s acceptability solely on the basis of the initial proposal submitted.  The Government may proceed with award of the contract without discussion.  However, the Government may request additional information from offerors that it considers having a reasonable chance of being selected for contract award, and may discuss proposals with the offerors.  Prior to award of contract, the contractor, if not a small business, will be required to submit and have GSA approve a small business subcontracting plan.  Contract award will be contingent upon receipt and approval of a subcontracting plan, in accordance with Public Law 95-507, to provide the maximum practical opportunities for Small Businesses, Small Businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, and by Women-Owned Small Businesses.

The proposed procurement listed herein is not set aside for small business.  All responsible sources not limited by the restrictions stated in the first paragraph the may submit a bid, which will be considered by the agency within the limits of this announcement.  Offers from Hub Zone small business concerns will receive a price evaluation preference per FAR 19.13.  FAR Clause 52.219-4 Notice of Price Evaluation Preference for Hub Zone Small Business Concerns shall apply.  

The RFP specification and Construction Documents are available by link via this announcement.  The list of plan holders will be based only on those requesting the Bid Documents via FEDTeDS (see above) through the link contained in this announcement.  Those requesting drawings, plans, and/or specifications must first register at www.ccr.gov.  Contact Karen Poole, Contracting Officer, for questions concerning this announcement at 816-823-4920 or fax her at 816-823-5935.

QUESTION: Under Notional Req Statement: you mention in the fourth sentence of the second paragraph "Sources able to provide fully licensed support in all seven systems areas are required."

In that numerous systems and sub-systems are detailed in the numbered paras (2) through (7) would you please clarify exactly which of these systems the Coast Guard desires fully licensed support for.

ANSWER: All listed systems and subsystems/components are currently incorporated in maintenance contracts for which support contractors have obtained licensing rights in order to perform maintenance work.  The Coast Guard wishes for the issue of full licensing for every system and subsystem to be addressed in respondent proposals; however, the requirement to obtain license rights would be necessary only if this Source Sought Notice results in an actual solicitation.

<DESC>This is Modification No. 3 to the synopsis entitled "Metallic Test Article Development and General and Precision Machining (MTAGPM) Services", which was posted on December 15, 2003. The purposes of this modification are to notify prospective providers that:  (1) there is a special standard of responsibility for private sector offerors for this competition, which must be demonstrated for the private sector company to receive a critical part of the solicitation; (2) the NAICS code for this procurement is 33641 and the size standard under this code is 1,000 employees; and (3) the Government intends to utilize the Tradeoff Source Selection Process for this competition, as defined in OMB Circular A-76. The Government will release a workload portfolio as part of the Draft and Final Solicitations for the MTAGPM Services competition.  This workload portfolio will inlude a large number of actual historical MTAGPM tasks completed in Fiscal Year 2003. The portfolio will be provided on CD upon written request as specified below.  Receipt of the portfolio is critically important to a potential service provider's ability to submit a proposal. This portfolio will include specifications and drawings that are unclassified but are subject to the provisions of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  In addition, many tasks to be performed under any contract resulting from this competition will involve access to data subject to the provisions of ITAR.	To receive the ITAR-restricted data in the portfolio and in order to be considered a responsible offeror, a private sector company must provide evidence that it is registered with the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls.  The website for the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, which sets forth the requirements and instructions for registration, is      http://www.pmdtc.org/reference.htm      The offeror must provide a copy of its registration letter received from the Department of State or provide its PM/DTC Code.  Additionally, the offeror must provide the name, telephone number, and contact address of the Empowered Official, as defined in Part 120.25 of the ITAR (22 CFR 120-130), who is authorized to receive and assume responsibility for the ITAR controlled workload portfolio.  The registration letter or PM/DTC code, and the Empowered Official's name, address, and telephone number must be provided before the workload portfolio can be provided.  The workload portfolio will be available upon release of the Draft Solicitation, which is currently scheduled for on or about April 30, 2004.  Interested parties are encouraged to provide the requested information to the Contracting Officer, Rosemary C. Froehlich, as soon as possible and prior to that date.  Responses are requested to be sent by e-mail, if possible.  If sending information by fax, please fax to 757-864-9043 instead of the number listed below. A proposal received from a company that is not registered with the Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls on the date specified for receipt of offers shall be rejected as unacceptable. Documents related to this procurement (except the workload portfolio) will be available over the Internet.  These documents will reside on a World Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.  The Internet site, or URL, for the NASA/LaRC Business Opportunities home page is	   http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/bizops.cgi?gr=D&pin=23	   Offerors are responsible for monitoring this site for the release of the solicitation and any amendments.   Potential offerors are responsible for downloading their own copy of the solicitation and amendments (if any).

It will not be part of the page count and should be submitted under section (b).

RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS

Question No. 1:
What work is anticipated to be performed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory?  If the government anticipates significant LANL effort, are these cost included in the estimated costs provided by the government?

Answer No. 1:
It is not anticipated that the contractor will be required to provide CFTO (Task Order No. 1) support at LANL and is not included in the cost estimate.

Question No.2:
For Task Order 0002, is it the government’s intent to include LANL and Chestnut and no longer include Building 963 in the performance of the task order?

Answer No. 2:
Attachment 2, page 2 of 3, Section 7.0 Other Considerations, the second sentence is modified as follows:  

Delete…..  the Chestnut Range, but will also include other sights such as Los Alamos National Lab.
Add: ……. Sandia Technical area IV (building 963).  However Participation in systems tests at remote locations may be required.

Question No.3:
Reference:  Section D, Proposal Instructions (1) Technical Proposal Section D Contractor Statement of Work (CSOW), third Sentence.

Issue: The reference states that the proposed approaches should describe how the taskings will be accomplished under the resultant contract (e.g. scope, technical requirements, deliverables and schedule shall be incorporated into the successful offerors’ monthly Status Report (or other more appropriate Contract Data requirements List (11 pages).”

Question: Does the government want the offeror’s proposed approaches to be included in the CSOW?

Answer No. 3:
We don't want the offerors' approaches to be in the CSOW, only include what work they intended to satisfy the technical task descriptions in the BAA.

Question No. 4:
References: (1) Section D, Proposal Instructions, second paragraph, and (2) Amendment 04 to solicitation.
Issue: The reference gives page allocations for all sections except Prior Work.

Question: Please advise how many pages are allocated to (e) Description of Relevant Prior Work.  Does this change the total number of pages allocated to Volume I?

Answer No. 4:  
The offer is allowed up to five (5) additional pages, to be counted in the total page count to address relevant Prior Work. 

Question No.5:
Within the context of Amendment 04, we assume that regardless of choices contractors may make to bid on some/all task areas or some/all task order, the following sections are always required in volume I: Executive Summary, Program Description/Plan, and Description of Relevant Prior Experience; and required in Volume II: CSOW and resumes of Key Individuals.  Is this true?

Answer No. 5:

Yes.

Question No. 6:
Under what circumstances is a contractor required to submit a technical proposal for the Sample Task Order?  Can a contractor submit a cost proposal on Sample Task Order without a technical proposal?  If the Sample Problem is not to be awarded, is it possible for a contractor to be granted a contract award and one or two task order awards without submitting a technical or cost proposal for the Sample Task Order?

Answer No. 6:
If a Technical proposal is submitted, then a cost proposal is required.  An offeror who intends to bid on the entire effort - all task areas, should respond to all the Task Orders, both contemplated/actual and the sample task order.    Award will not be made to a offeror, who doesn’t respond to the task order or technical area.   

Question No. 07:
The reference also specifies some proposal elements (blank pages, title pages, table of contents, lists of figures, lists of tables, table, cover sheets and blank dividers” as being outside the page counts.  Please clarify whether tables and figures are included in the page count?

Answer No. 07:

List of tables, figures are not part of the page count.

Question No. 08: 
The reference also specifies some proposal elements (indices, photographs, foldouts, appendices, attachments) as being inside the page counts.  Would the government please define indices- would the listing of acronyms and a compliance matrix be considered indices and therefore be included in the page count?

Answer No, 08:
The listing of acronyms and a compliance matrix are not part of the page count.  By definition, Indices is the plural form of Index.

Question No. 09:
Reference: (1) attachment 1 Section 5.0, Attachment (2) attachment 2, section 5.0, and (3) Attachment 3, Section 5.0

Recommendation 1:

Task Order 0001, Section 5.3, CDRL A001 (System Safety Hazard Analysis Report) is specified, Since this CDRL is experimental hardware specific, after discussions with the COTR, we recommend it be deleted from CFTO and included when appropriate under specific technical tasks, due as required.

Response to recommendation No. 1: 
We agree with moving CDRL A008 from the CFTO to the Task Orders as appropriate.

Recommendation 2:
Task Order 001, Section 5.4, CDRL A002 (Safety Assessment Report) is experiment specific.  After discussions with the COTR, we recommend it be deleted from CFTO and included when appropriate under specific technical tasks, due 10 days to test.

Response to recommendation No. 2: 
We agree with moving CDRL A002 from the CFTO to the Task Orders as appropriate.

Recommendation 3:
Task Order 0001, Section 5.7, CDRL A008 (Environmental Health and Safety Plan) states that it is due at award, but the CDRL states that it is to be appended to the Management Plan.  There is not a CDRL nor a deliverable noted for the Management Plan.  If this is due upon award, does the government want this included in the Proposal, and if yes, does it count in the technical page count?  If not, we recommend you consider requesting it be due DOA plus 60 days.

Response to recommendation No. 3:
Section 2. Proposal Preparation Instructions, page 6 of 8 is modified to include the following language.

The management plan for Task Order 001 is due with the proposal for Task Order 0001.  It should address a tasking approach to estimate and track expenditures of level-of-effort (LOE) hours, LOE dollars and other direct costs (ODCs) for the anticipated effort.  It will not be part of the page count and should be submitted under section (b).

Recommendation 4:
Task Order 0002, Section 5.8, CDRL A008 (A008 (Environmental Health and Safety Plan) states that it is due at award.  This CDRL is facility specific, not experiment specific and is already provided under the CFTO.  Therefore, after consultation with the COTR, we recommend it be deleted from this work.

Response to recommendation No. 4:
We agree with deleting CDRL A008 from TO 0002.

Recommendation 5:
Sample Task Order, Section 5.8, CDRL A008 (A008 (Environmental Health and Safety Plan) states that it is due at award.  This CDRL is facility specific, not experiment specific and is already provided under the CFTO.  Therefore, after consultation with the COTR, we recommend it be deleted from this work.

Response to recommendation No. 5:
We agree with deleting CDRL A008 from the Sample Task Order.

<DESC>The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has developed and demonstrated a small-scale (production of 10,000 to 20,000 gallons per day) methane liquefaction plant.  The novel process is designed for use in combination with high-pressure natural gas pipelines in city-gate and non-city-gate locations.  C02 and H20 removal have been incorporated into the liquefaction process to reduce the operating and capital costs of pre-treatment.  The liquefaction plant is designed to be modular and can be sized for variation in gas flows and pressures.  The patented process is available for a field of use, royalty-bearing license to qualified firms. Firms having serious interest in licensing this technology should contact the points of contact listed below.

<DESC>Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) plans to establish four (4) to six (6) Basic Ordering Agreements (BOAs) with qualified construction companies to provide construction craftsmen and supervision for the performance of HVAC work as required at the ANL site for a period of one (1) year.  Awards will be made to those HVAC companies submitting proposals most advantageous to ANL, technical, cost, and other factors considered.

These BOAs are intended for short lead-time HVAC construction projects.  Generally, the construction costs of individual work orders under the BOA will not exceed $50,000.00.  However, the total estimated cost for the one-year BOA duration is one and one half million dollars.  There is no guaranteed minimum dollar amount to be awarded under these HVAC BOAs and it will be at ANLâ€™s discretion as to when these HVAC BOAs will be utilized.  Options to extend the term of each BOA for two (2) one-year periods will also be included in the Agreement.

For an individual HVAC construction project, each BOA contractor will be asked to submit a lump sum proposal based on construction specifications and drawings.  ANL will then award a work order under the BOA to the low offeror.

Typical work awarded through work orders issued under the BOAs may include constructing, repairing or replacing: ductwork; chiller systems; steam systems; air handlers; pumps, fans, piping and control systems.

One of the goals of the transformation is achieving an unqualified audit opinion on the FY 2007 DoD Agency-wide Financial Statements.  To assist the Department in achieving this goal, the Secretary of Defense established the Business Management Modernization Program (BMMP), which is leading the transformation.  One of the primary objectives of the BMMP is the development of the DoD Business Enterprise Architecture (BEA).  The BEA will provide the “roadmap” that will guide DoD decision-makers through the transformation and modernization of its business processes and systems.  Essential to obtaining an unqualified opinion on the FY 2007 financial statements, the Department must also aggressively resolve many Material Weaknesses while incrementally implementing the BEA.

However, the Contractor requires access to the Comptoller Network which requires a Secret Clearance.  System security shall be in accordance with DoD directive 8500.1, Information Assurance.  

Magnitude. This order will require personnel secured to the level of:
AIS-I	-	none.
AIS-II	-	All employees.

Security Investigation Requirements for Automated Information Systems (AIS):

For AIS-I: Contractor requires access to the Comptoller Network which requires a Secret Clearance.  The contractor will be working with sensitive information which is covered by the Privacy Act and which is category AIS I.  All contractor personnel requiring AIS-I access to the OUSD(C) systems will complete a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI).  An AIS-I position may be occupied pending the completion of the SSBI once the National Agency Check (NAC) portion has been completed and favorably adjudicated.  

For AIS-II: Contractor requires access to the Comptoller Network which requires a Secret Clearance. The contractor will be working with sensitive information which is covered by the Privacy Act and which is category AIS II.  Contractor must ensure sensitive (privacy act) information is properly safeguarded at the work-site and not removed from the work site. In addition, the contractor will be required to comply with the security requirements associated with access to the OUSD(C) enterprise network.  This requires individuals who perform duties at the AIS II category to have a favorable determination of requisite investigation IAW the specifications of the DoD Personnel Security Program as provided for in the DoD 5200.2-R.  If required, the contractor may be requested to undergo a higher level of investigation. 

Documentation Submission. The National Agency Check (NAC) for AIS-II and the Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) for AIS-I requires  contractor submission of the following investigative documents:

Standard Form 86 - Questionnaire for National Security Positions

Completed EPSQ, to include a copy on a disk and a signed hard copy, will be provided to the Contract Officer’s Representative (COR) or Government Point Of Contact (GPOC) elsewhere named in this award.  All SF 86s must be accompanied with the FD 258 Finger Print Card and a copy of the contractor’s birth certificate for citizenship verification.  Foreign Nationals must submit appropriate documentation from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  The COR/GPOC will notify the contractor when contractor employees have been approved for access to the facility.  The appropriate investigations (NAC or SSBI) should be completed before the contractor employee begins work.  

Waiver Procedures.  

For AIS-I: An AIS I position may be occupied pending the completion of the SSBI once the NAC portion has been completed and favorably adjudicated.  A previous National Agency Check with Written Inquiries (NACI) or an Entrance NAC may be used for emergency appointment, provided a break in service of more than 24 months has not occurred since completion of that investigation and the SSBI has been initiated, and a Waiver of Pre-appointment Investigative Requirements has been granted.

For AIS-II: On an exception basis and if an emergency situation exists, a US citizen contractor employee may begin once the Waiver of Pre-appointment Investigative Requirements has been granted by the proponent Business Line Executive, Client Executive, or Corporate Director.  Waivers can be made, provided no potentially disqualifying information is known concerning the contractor employee, and all pre-appointment security checks have been favorably completed.  

Findings. All contractor employees must receive a favorable NAC or SSBI.  Unfavorable NAC or SSBI findings will require individual determinations by the security office before allowing contractor employee access to the facility.

Non-US citizens. Employment of non-US citizens requires a fully completed and favorably adjudicated background investigation prior to beginning OUSD(C) work.

Section 12 – Special Terms and Conditions

The Contractor may be required to have access to highly sensitive and confidential plans to complete required analysis and recommendations.   The Contractor shall not divulge any information about DoD activities or functions, or any other knowledge that may be gained, to anyone not expressly authorized by the COR.  The Contractor shall keep confidential any proprietary information  received by DoD from other contractor sources.  The Contractor will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement.  The Contractor must have the proper authority and “need-to-know” prior to any discussions involving classified or sensitive information.  The Contractor will observe and comply with the security provisions in effect within OSD.  The Contractor shall notify the COR of any situation which, in the Contractor’s judgement, potential for OCI may exist so that the COR and the Contractor can take appropriate action to mitigate the OCI risk. 

The Contractor selected for this effort may be precluded from future competitive selection by a contracting officer of a subsequent procument:
(a) in which the Contractor will have an unfair competitive advantage because of work under this SOW or
(b) to provide systems (or major system components) for which:
(i) the Contractor provided systems engineering and technical direction or
(ii) the Contractor developed specifications or work statements.

The contractor may continue to provide services in the PMO support role.

In order to prevent or mitigate potential organizational conflicts of interest, the Agency may develop and include appropriate organizational conflict of interest provisions in this Contract.  In addition to and unless modified by such order-specific organizational conflict of interest provisions, the following restrictions and definitions apply to this Contract and are established to prevent conflicting roles which may bias the Contractor’s judgement or objectivity, or to preclude the Contractor from obtaining an unfair competitive advantage in concurrent or future acquisitions.  The following subsections prescribe certain limitations on contracting as the means of avoiding, neutralizing or mitigating organizational conflicts of interest, in order to ensure that there is no interruption in the work performed under the Contract.  

The Contractor shall discuss any potential or known conflicts with existing efforts being performed under the contracts or subcontracts under its purview.  The Contractor shall specifically identify the organization and individuals (by name, title, location, and telephone number) responsible for reviewing potential conflict of interest situations. DoD requires that the Contractor reviews each task under the Contract to identify those areas where a potential conflict of interest exists or where the “appearance” of a conflict of interest may exist.  The COR and the Contracting Officer will review each situation to determine whether or not the situation warrants cause for concern.  

If, under this Contract, the Contractor is tasked to prepare or assist in preparing a work statement to be used in competitively acquiring a system or services, the Contractor shall not supply the system, its major components, or the service unless the Contractor is the sole source, the Contractor has participated in the development and design work, or more than one Contractor has been involved in preparing the work statement.  The term of this prohibition shall endure for the entire period of this Contract and for two (2) years thereafter.

Unless the government and the Contractor first establish proper safeguards to ensure objectivity; the Contractor shall not provide technical evaluation under this Statement of Work in any procurement action in which the Contractor’s conclusions may be biased because the Contractor’s own products or services, or products or services that compete with the Contractor’s own products or services, are among those to be evaluated.

Non-Disclosure Statement

ALL Contractor employees who perform on contracts subject to organizational conflict of interest restrictions shall execute and sign a non-disclosure statement.   This requirement extends all subcontracts, teaming arrangements. A copy of this statement shall be provided to the Contracting Officer.   The statement shall consist of the following:

Conflict Of Interest And Non-Disclosure Statement

I certify that I will not discuss with, or reveal to, any representative of any business organization or other entity, or any individual person either within or without the United States Government, any aspects of pending procurements or awarded contracts of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) while performing services under HQ0421-XX-X-XXXX.  The term "any aspects of the pending procurement" includes, but is not limited to, information such as the identity and number of contractors, the method of procurement, the number and identity of Government personnel involved, and the schedule of key technical and procurement events in the source selection process, etc.  Except as specifically authorized by the PCO, the release of such information constitutes the unauthorized release of advance procurement or procurement information.

I recognize that a significant factor in the successful and proper completion of the source selection process is the strict confidentiality observed by all participants in the various proposal evaluation and evaluation review groups concerning all of the activities and procedures involved in source selection and that failure to comply with these requirements may compromise the ultimate source selection.  I acknowledge that the unauthorized release of advance procurement or procurement information as defined herein may result in the termination of my participation for HQ0421-XX-X-XXXX.

In the event I release any of the advance procurement or procurement information covered hereby, I agree to so advise the Senior Contracting Officer at the DFAS site to which I am assigned as soon as practicable.  That advice will identify the business organization or other entity, or individual person, to whom the information in question was divulged and the content of that information. 

I further affirm that in the event that any business entity, either as a prime or subcontractor, in which I, or a member of my family or household, have holdings, financial interest, or an employment relationship, of whatever nature and to whatever extent, has submitted a proposal in response to a DFAS requirement that I will notify the Senior Contracting Officer at the DFAS site to which I am assigned in writing.

Section 13 – Experience Requirements

Contractor will have experience in decision making in the DoD at the General Officer, SES or equivalent level.  Contractor will have experience as a program manager and experience in identifying and developing programs to rectify systemic problems in DoD asset valuation, accountability and management.  Contractor will have experience in determining and addressing, from both a near term work practice perspective and a longer term process and systemic solution, root causes of persistent DoD material weaknesses.  The Contractor must be thoroughly experienced and knowledgeable of the responsibilities of, and the key senior leaders within, various Offices of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the DoD Components (e.g., DCFO, Director A&FP&A, OUSD(AT&L), OUSD(LM&R), Directors of the BMMP Domains, and senior leaders within the offices of the ASA, ASN and ASAF FM&Cs); the Department’s Material Weaknesses and Component efforts to resolve them; DoD business and financial management policies, regulations and information technology systems; federal statutes and federal accounting standards; guidelines and requirements of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and Department of the Treasury; and issues and problems impeding an unqualified opinion as identified by the DoD Inspector General (IG) and General Accounting Office (GAO).

<RESPDATE>102904
<ARCHDATE>12282004
<CONTACT>Cheryl Miles, 301-619-7148
<DESC>The point-of-contact for this announcement is Mr. Scott Doughty (scott.doughty at amedd.army.mil). THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION ANNOUNCEMENT. This is a sources sought synopsis only. The purpose of this sources sought synopsis is to gain knowledge of po tential qualified sources for planning purposes only for the U.S. Army Medical Materiel Development Activity (USAMMDA), Fort Detrick, Maryland. Its mission is to protect and preserve the lives of America's sons and daughters by providing new drugs, vaccine s, and medical devices that enhance readiness, ensure the provision of the highest quality medical care to DoD, and maximize the survival rate for medical casualties on the battlefield. USAMMDA is seeking a Contract Research Organization (CRO) to develop a  variety of Ã¢Â€Â˜Point-of-CareÃ¢Â€Â™ (POC) assays to diagnose militarily relevant infectious diseases and to take these forward under the most appropriate regulatory mechanism for FDA clearance or approval, and ensure that they remain commercially availab le for use by the U.S. military for a minimum of 5 years.  Collaborations with USAMMDA would be required for the test and evaluation of these assays to ensure that they meet military requirements. The CRO would be responsible for preparing a 510(k) applica tion or PreMarket Approval Application (PMA), as appropriate, for submission to the FDA for each assay, and must ensure that these assays are available for purchase by the U.S. military once cleared or approved by the FDA. We envision that POC assays are r apid detection devices capable of determining whether clinically ill soldiers are infected with a particular pathogen. The assay should detect the pathogen OR an alternative bio-marker that is specific for the pathogen.  The assay must be rapid (less then 30 min), one- or two-step format, and stable (storage at 35 degrees C for 2 years). The assay should be 85 percent sensitive and 85 percent specific for the particular agent compared to current reference diagnostic assays. The assay must be soldier-friendl y (i.e., easy to operate), inexpensive, portable, use heat-stable reagents, and have no special storage requirements.  A standardized platform is desired (i.e., if multiple assays are provided they should all be similar in design). Pathogens for which we d esire POC-DD include: Leishmania sps. (assay detects all species of Leishmania), flaviviruses (detects all flaviviruses), alphaviruses (detects all alphaviruses), bunyaviruses (detects all bunyaviruses, dengue virus, Rickettsia typi, Rickettsia rickettsia,  Orientia tsutsugamushi, various enteric pathogens (Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Shigella sps., Salmonella sps., etc.), and hantaan virus.  Additional assays are envisioned.  Sample matrix will depend on the pathogen of interest (e.g., skin scrapings will be used to test for Leishmania, whole blood or sera for dengue virus, and stool samples for Shigella).Ideally the FDA-cleared 510(k) application or approved PMA would be held and managed by the CRO, although consideration could be given to the U.S. Army Medic al Research and Materiel Command holding the application and the CRO managing it. The CRO should be able to demonstrate that they have the ability and experience to successfully develop an FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic assay.  A short fact sheet (less  than 3 pages) is requested that summarizes capabilities of the CRO in completing the requirements identified above. However, this announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal. No contract will be awarded from this announceme nt. No reimbursement will be made of any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate announcement. This synopsis is for info rmation and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Each response must reference the sources sought title. All prop rietary information should be marked as such. Responses will be held confidential if requested. Please submit fact sheets to the attention of: USAMMDA, ATTN:  MCMR-UMP, 622 Neiman Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5009. Fact sheets may be emailed to: Scott.Do ughty at amedd.army.mil. Responses must be received no later than October 29, 2004, by 4:00 P.M. Eastern Standard Time.

Its mission is to protect and preserve the lives of America's sons and daughters by providing new drugs, vaccines, and m edical devices that enhance readiness, ensure the provision of the highest quality medical care to DoD, and maximize the survival rate for medical casualties on the battlefield. USAMMDA is seeking a Contract Research Organization (CRO) to take 'Real-Time P CR' research assays developed by the U.S. military to diagnose militarily relevant infectious diseases forward under the most appropriate regulatory mechanism for FDA clearance or approval, and ensure that they remain commercially available for use by the U.S. military for a minimum of 5 years. Collaborations with USAMMDA would be required for the test and evaluation of these assays to ensure that they meet military requirements. The CRO would be responsible for preparing a 510(k) application or PreMarket A pproval Application (PMA), as appropriate, for submission to the FDA for each assay, and must ensure that these assays are available for purchase by the U.S. military once cleared or approved by the FDA.  USAMMDA can envision an approach whereby the CRO wo uld subcontract various portions of the work, but would remain responsible for the overall management and success of the program. Initial Real-time PCR assays must be capable of being used in a CAP0-CLIA-certified clinical laboratory.  Ideally the assays w ill be able to be used in an austere operational environment in which maintenance of a reliable cold-chain would be problematic.  The real-time PCR assay must be developed and cleared or approved by the FDA for use on the R.A.P.I.D. (Idaho Technologies, In c.), Smartcycler (Cepheid) or Lightcycler (Roche) PCR platforms. Pathogens for which we desire Real-time PCR assays include: Leishmania sps. (assay detects all species of Leishmania) as well as L. major, L. tropica, and visceral disease (L. donovoni-L. inf antum); flaviviruses (detects all flaviviruses); alphaviruses (detects all alphaviruses); bunyaviruses (detects all bunyaviruses); dengue virus, Rickettsia typi, Rickettsia rickettsia, Orientia tsutsugamushi, various enteric pathogens (Cryptosporidium, E. coli, Shigella sps., Salmonella sps., etc.); Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax; and hantaan virus.  Additional assays are envisioned.  Sample matrix will depend on the pathogen of interest (e.g., skin scrapings will be used to test for Leishmania, whole b lood or sera for dengue virus, and stool samples for Shigella). Ideally the FDA-cleared 510(k) application or approved PMA would be held and managed by the CRO, although consideration could be given to the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command ho lding the application and the CRO managing it. The CRO should be able to demonstrate that they have the ability and experience to successfully develop an FDA-cleared or approved diagnostic assay.  A short fact sheet (less than 3 pages) is requested that su mmarizes capabilities of the CRO in completing the requirements identified above. However, this announcement is not a formal solicitation and is not a request for proposal. No contract will be awarded from this announcement. No reimbursement will be made o f any costs to provide information in response to this announcement or any follow up information requests. Availability of any formal solicitation will be announced under a separate announcement. This synopsis is for information and planning purposes only and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government. Each response must reference the sources sought title. All proprietary information should be marke d as such. Responses will be held confidential if requested. Please submit fact sheets to the attention of: USAMMDA, ATTN:  MCMR-UMP, 622 Neiman Street, Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5009. Fact sheets may be emailed to Scott.Doughty at amedd.army.mil.

<SUBJECT>89 -- INTERNET SHOPPING -SUBSISTENCE
<DESC>The Defense Commissary Agency (DeCA) operates approximately 275 commissaries (similar to commercial grocery stores) worldwide.  DeCA sells the grocery food and nonfood items to authorized military patrons.  The products sold are primarily brand name items but also includes non brand name items, such as meat, produce, etc.  These items are sold at cost plus a 5% surcharge which is used to build and renovate commissaries.

DeCA is exploring Internet shopping as an alternative method to deliver the commissary benefit to authorized patrons.  We intend to “link up” with suppliers to offer products that build upon our current product assortment and generate high incremental volume opportunities through a redirect link from our website www.commissaries.com. 

Suppliers must offer a  substantial discount to authorized military patrons which will be negotiated once accepted into the program. For information about how you can be a part of this exciting business opportunity, interested parties can contact Mr. Bill Pickett at (804) 734-8233 or email @ william.pickett@deca.mil by August 23, 2004.  Additional information about the Defense Commissary Agency can be found on our website @ www.commissaries.com.

(b) Definitions. As used in this clause: 

“Expanded Affiliated Group” means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504
of such Code shall be applied by substituting `more than 50 percent' for `at least 80 percent' each place it appears. 

“Foreign Incorporated Entity” means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or 
(ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and 
(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. 
“Person”, “domestic”, and “foreign” have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs 
(1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. 

(c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. 

(1) Certain Stock Disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: 
(i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or 
(ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. 
(2) Plan Deemed In Certain Cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan.

(e) Treatment of Certain Rights. 
(1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: 
(i) warrants; 
(ii) options; 
(iii) contracts to acquire stock; 
(iv) convertible debt instruments; and 
(v) others similar interests. 
(2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of Section 835. 

(f) Disclosure. 
By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

The selection will consist of a Best Value source selection process based upon merits of the offer and the offeror’s capability.  Under a best value source selection, nonprice evaluation factors, when combined are significantly more important than price.  USAID will consider an Offeror’s past performance and experience to be more important than its price.  However, the USAID will not select an offeror for award on the basis of a superior capability without consideration of the amount of its price.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial services prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation.  Q uotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  This synopsis/solicitation is for the following services:  In an effort to promote reuse and recycling practices, Fort Carson, CO, desires entering into an agreement with a relia ble and well-established recycling company whereby the company collects the used antifreeze from mutually agreed upon locations across Fort Carson, CO, and recycles the spent material into new antifreeze.  Fort Carson, CO, will also entertain proposals to buy back the recycled antifreeze but will not be bound to do so by the agreement, nor will the contractor be required to furnish the recycled antifreeze should the Government desire to purchase it.  Used antifreeze will be collected from several Ft Carson,  CO, locations on a routine basis for recycling.  A contracted source that can fulfill the management and technical requirements of this contract with minimal supervision from the Government is desired.  To qualify, the following minimum criteria must be m et:  (a)  Meet all State and Federal laws concerning handling of hazardous materials, AND (b)  possess all required transportation licenses (The Contractor must have a valid CDL license) AND, (c)  a minimum of six months experience in processing used antif reeze by either distillation or deionization AND, (d) the ability to provide up to fifty 250-gallon storage totes at no cost to the Government AND, (e) the ability to collect used antifreeze from several locations on at least a monthly basis.  The contract or, as an independent contractor and not as an agent of the Government, shall provide overall management of the Fort Carson used antifreeze collection program.  The Contractor shall be responsible for meeting overall environmental compliance requirements a ssociated with used antifreeze collection, handling, transportation, treatment, record keeping and recycling of the recovered antifreeze product.  The Contractor shall provide up to fifty (50), 250-gallon storage totes at up to thirty-two (32) locations ac ross Fort Carson.  The totes will be either double walled construction, placed in secondary containment, or have a cage-type device surrounding them to help avoid puncturing, thereby reducing the possibility of a spill.  The Government will provide access to the installation and a point of contact to assist with any manifesting and transportation issues.  Specific Tasks:  Task 1:  Pick Up:  The Contractor will visit each location at least once per month to pick up used antifreeze.  Frequency of pick ups wil l vary based on mission and actual generated quantities.  Prior to the initial pickup, the Government will test the used antifreeze from several of the totes to ensure the used antifreeze passes the TCLP and is not a hazardous waste.  The contractor will e nsure he possesses adequate spill kit materials in his transport vehicle to clean up any spills caused by the contractor at the pick up locations.   Task 2: Manifesting and Payment:  The Contractor must identify the quantity of used antifreeze picked up by  either weight or volume on an agreed upon document format, have a Fort Carson building representative sign the document, and submit the information monthly to the Contracting Officer Representative (COR).  Task 3: Storage Totes: Fort Carson estimates that  one tote per building will generally be adequate for temporary used antifreeze storage, but in some cases a drum may be appropriate.  In other cases, two or three totes may be needed.  Locations include, but are not limited to, Buildings 501, 636, 749, 13 82, 1392, 1682, 1692, 1882, 1982, 2082, 2392, 2427, 2492, 2692, 2792, 2992, 3092, 3192, 3292, 7418, 7426, 8000 (multiple totes), 8030 (multiple totes), 8142, 81 52, 8200, 8300, 8930, 9072.

Q1:  Regarding DESCRIPTION, section 1.5 and 2.2, a tilting or variable-incidence-angle stage is called for.  How necessary is the variation in ion incidence angle from a process, materials and/or device point-of-view?  Our company can offer variable angle, but we also can offer a new, much more capable multi-target alloy (or single material)co-sputtering deposition system that does have ion etch capability, but only at normal incidence to the stage.  If the ion etching is to be used mainly for pre-cleaning the substrate and for straight, physical sputtering for material removal, then this kind of system might be a cost-effective and high-performance choice.  This kind of system has a load lock as a standard option.  On the other hand, if the devices being fabricated require sloping sidewalls or high aspect ratio trenches to be etched, then variable-angle ion etching might be required.  Please advise.

A:  Variable incidence for etch is absolutely required.  This feature allows etch profiles to be precisely tuned and can be used to minimize edge redeposition.  Further, we require low-incidence etching for planarization processes.

Q2:  Is it permissible for one vendor to submit two proposals/quotations?  We could propose both a) a system with variable angle stage but expensive loadlock and b) a system with fixed angle stage but cost-effective loadlock.  Then NOAA could look at the full specs and price on both and make a decision.  Is this acceptable?

You may submit more than one proposal.  However, one must be submitted in response to our specified requirement and the other must be designated as an "alternate."  However,  the Government requires a variable angle stage.  The load lock options are to be quoted separately.

<DESC>SCOPE OF WORK

“DEFINITIONAL MISSION” FOR ADVISORY AND ASSISTANCE SERVICES BY NON-GOVERNMENTAL SOURCES FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS IN ROMANIA”

PROJECT TITLE:  INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY DEFINIATIONAL MISSION FOR ROMANIA

1		SCOPE OF WORK

The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (“USTDA”) requires services under this non-personal services Contract to support or improve its decision-making relative to the funding of projects and activities in developing and middle income countries. The Contractor shall provide a report to USTDA, which will: 

1.2		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for the proposed feasibility study or other activities; 

1.3		assess any alternative study or activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

1.4	provide supporting analysis and recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all the relevant issues. 

2  		DELIVERY & PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

2.1		KICK-OFF MEETING WITH THE USTDA PROGRAM OFFICE

Upon award, the Contractor shall contact USTDA’s Contracting Officer’s Technical Representative to schedule a meeting to discuss details of the Contract assignment.  Unless otherwise advised by the COTR, this meeting will be held at USTDA’s office in Arlington, Virginia. The COTR shall provide the Contractor with names and addresses of the project sponsor(s), other pertinent entities to contact in the United States and overseas, and any other relevant details that may impact upon the design and/or evaluation of the proposed project(s).  

2.2		PRE-VISIT REPORT

Prior to departure to the host country, the Contractor shall provide the COTR a pre-visit written report of 3-5 pages containing the proposed schedule or itinerary, preliminary strategies or findings on project viability, financing options, U.S. company interest in the project, a list of contacts to be made during the visit and a pre-visit checklist of issues, information and questions to be utilized during the visit.  

2.3		USTDA RESPONSIBILITY

USTDA will advise the U.S. Embassy in the host country of the Contractor’s proposed travel itinerary prior to departure and request that the Commercial Section of the Embassy provide the Contractor with names and addresses of appropriate host country officials with whom to meet.

2.4		CONTRACTOR’S HOST COUNTRY TRAVEL 

The Contractor shall travel to the host country to meet with relevant project officials and with the U.S. Embassy.    The Contractor shall contact the Commercial Section at the U.S. Embassy upon arrival and prior to departure for briefing and debriefing meetings.   While the Embassy may be able to assist the Contractor in arranging some initial meetings with host country officials, the Contractor is responsible for arranging the meetings as well as logistics for the visit, i.e., hotel accommodations, transportation, and interpretation services. In some cases, the Contractor may need to Contract with a local entity to assist with these logistics.  Local entities may not provide the technical work of substance for the creation of the DM report. 

2.5		CONTRACTOR MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS

The Contractor shall hold meaningful discussions with appropriate contacts to determine and gauge the interest of potential project financiers and potential U.S. suppliers and assess whether the proposed project(s) is economically, financially, and technically viable.  The Contractor shall analyze the potential procurement of U.S. goods and services for project implementation by categories and dollar values.  The analysis shall include an assessment of the project risks and its financial viability, the priority of the project and political/social/organizational support it has, potential sources of financing, and the capability and experience of the project sponsor.  The analysis shall also include an assessment of the social and economic development impacts of the proposed project.

2.6		USTDA REPORT OBJECTIVES

If the Contractor recommends that USTDA fund the study (ies) in a phased approach, and/or if any outstanding issues should be resolved or conditions met before funding is approved, those phases, issues and/or conditions should be clearly explained in the recommendation.

2.6.2		The Contractor shall provide a final report to the USTDA, which will: 

2.6.2.1		assess and justify whether or not USTDA should provide funding for a feasibility study of the proposed project(s); 

2.6.2.2		         assess any alternative or other activities which the Contractor sees as viable options for USTDA consideration; and 

2.6.2.3	          provide recommendations on the above information in a final report that analyzes all relevant issues

2.6.3		Contractor recommendations shall be based upon USTDA funding criteria, which are that the project must: 

2.6.3.1 		be likely to receive implementation financing, and in addition, have a procurement process that provides “equal access” to U.S. firms;

2.6.3.2		represent an opportunity for sales of U.S. goods and services that is many times greater than the initial investment of USTDA assistance;

2.6.3.3		be a development priority of the project sponsor and country where the project is located and have the endorsement of the U.S. Embassy in that nation; and

2.6.3.4		involve U.S. companies that are facing strong competition from foreign companies receiving subsidies and other support from their governments.

6 PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS AND PROFILE

The Government of Romania (GOR) has made great strides in developing the country’s framework for ICT growth.  With a population of 21.7 million people, Romania has the eighth largest IT market in Eastern Europe.  In 2002, Romania’s IT spending reached $460 million, composed of computer hardware (62 percent), packaged software (14 percent), and computer services (24 percent) according to the International Data Corporation.  Reports produced by the U.S. Department of Commerce in 2003 state that the Romanian IT market is expected to grow an average of 10 percent a year with software and services growing faster than hardware sales.

The GOR has introduced e-Signature legislation and has begun piloting a series of project concepts aimed at building an e-Romania in the context of an e-Europe.  Since 1999, Romania has focused on strengthening its interconnectivity, and as a result has expedited the implementation of new programs.  At the end of 2001, Romania became the first country to deploy Code Division Multiple Access Technology (CDMA) 2000 in Europe and the first in the world to build a high-speed (153 kbs) mobile digital 450 MHz network using CDMA technology. Romania’s efforts to establish itself as a leader in the ICT sector are evident by the fact that Romania won first prize at the World Summit on IT 2004 for the first government portal for e-Government in Europe. 

In response to the growing push by the GOR for greater interconnectivity and increased IT access to the general population, USTDA has been asked to consider the following projects in the ICT sector.  The DM consultant will not only evaluate the projects listed below, but will also consider any other opportunities in the ICT sector that may benefit from USTDA funding.

·	Municipality of Bucharest – One sole sourced proposal
·	Municipality of Bucharest – Proposal for an environmental hazards monitoring project, that would develop an environmental crisis mitigation system able to forecast in real time in order to minimize environmental hazards to the local population. 
·	Ministry of IT and Communications - A Technical Assistance project to assist with the integration of all public institutions’ information systems.  The GOR would like to streamline the way public data is stored and would like all current systems to be interconnected to share information securely.

Definitional Mission
 
The DM Contractor will be required to travel to Romania for up to 8 working days to identify and review at least three (3) proposed projects in the ICT sector.  This DM requires expertise in general IT infrastructure, integration technologies and software, e-Government applications, as well as GIS technology.  The individual/team must exhibit strengths in IT infrastructure development, upgrades, and systems integration.  Prior to the Contractor’s departure, the firm will coordinate travel dates with the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest.  We anticipate that the Contractor will meet with several project sponsors in Bucharest or in outlying areas to assess potential projects for USTDA consideration.  This mission should take place within two business weeks.  The likely timing for the mission would be September 2004.  The Contractor will consider potential feasibility studies, technical assistance projects, and orientation visits for USTDA funding consideration.   The Contractor will prepare the relevant documentation for potential projects, including detailed scopes of work, terms of reference, and budgets where applicable.  The Contractor must be qualified to evaluate the economic, financial and technical viability of the proposed projects.
