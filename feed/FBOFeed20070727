<SUBJECT>A -- COMMERCIAL FISHING WORKFORCE ESTIMATES FOR THE EAST COAST

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control, NIOSH, Alaska Field Station (AFS) has a requirement to develop workforce estimates for the east coast fisheries with ample information conducive to the application of the NRC/NIOSH AFS protocol.

BACKGROUND 

Fatal traumatic injuries in commercial fishing have led this industry to be one of the most hazardous in the U.S., and many other nations.  The International Labor Organization (ILO) and Food and Agriculture Organization estimate that 7% of all worker fatalities worldwide occur in the fishing industry, despite that industry accounting for less than 1% of the worldwide workforce.  The fatality rate for U.S. commercial fishermen was 168 per 100,000 workers per year (1994-1998), 35 times the overall U.S. occupational fatality rate (4.8 per 100,000 workers per year, CFOI, 1994-1998).  

In October 2006, NIOSH AFS began to expand our commercial fishing project to identify risk factors for this dangerous industry for the entire country.  In order to accurately assess the risks in commercial fisheries among different types of vessels, we must be able to estimate the work force.  Having accurate workforce estimates will allow us to calculate rates and compare fishing operations to each other to identify the most hazardous.  Since each fishery is different, number of fishing days, vessels and crew size varies greatly.

To account for these variances, the NIOSH AFS has previously partnered with the Natural Resources Consulting firm in Seattle Washington.  Together, we have developed a protocol to identify each fishery, length of the opening, number of vessels operating, number of crew.  Based on this information, we calculate full time equivalents for each fishery so that the differences in time worked is reflected in the workforce estimate.  The NIOSH AFS and NRC have developed workforce estimates for Alaska and the Pacific coast using this jointly developed methodology.

The Government intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Natural Resources Consultants (NRC) in Seattle, WA because the Natural Resources Consultants (NRC) was established in 1980 to meet the need for a comprehensive consulting service dealing with all aspects of marine and inland fisheries and their related resource base. Since its formation, NRC has undertaken more than 1,800 projects involving assessment, conservation, utilization, valuation, enhancement and development of marine and inland aquatic resources.   The NRC has been a contractor of the NIOSH AFS for a number of years.  Together we have developed a methodology to estimate the workforce for the commercial fishing fleet in Alaska and the Pacific coast.  Steve Hughes has developed a methodology of collecting information regarding workforce effort for fisheries in Alaska and the Pacific coast.  Mr. Hughes is a well-known and respected professional and is a fisheries expert and is a technical advisor to three major commercial fishing associations in Alaska and the Pacific coast.

The vendor shall perform the following tasks to assist in the development of workforce estimates for the East Coast Fisheries following the NRC/NIOSH AFS Protocol.

A.	The NRC will work with NIOSH AFS to understand the information that is available for east coast fisheries to base work force estimates on.  Using this information, the NRC/NIOSH AFS methodology for workforce estimates will be implemented and modified as necessary to meet objectives.  
B.	The NRC will assist NIOSH/AFS in identifying and interviewing potential vendors to actually perform the data collection for the workforce estimates.  The actual task of consolidating the workforce estimates will be completed by this/these vendor(s). 
C.	The NRC will provide oversight to the selected vendor(s) information gathering including double checking the final product and providing recommendations and corrections to the vendor(s) prior to the product being finalized.

Responsible sources that believe they possess the expertise and capabilities identified above are encouraged to submit to the Contracting Officer within 15 days from the posting date of this notice their written specifications and supporting information in the format of their choice, not to exceed 10 pages.  Please submit to Denise Rains, 315 East Montgomery Avenue, Spokane, WA  99207, email dgr8@cdc.gov or fax (509)354-8099.  Reference 0000HCCJ-2007-46587.  The Government shall review all information submitted and determine if other qualified sources could perform the effort.  Information received in response to this notice will be used solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  If no affirmative responses are received within 15 days, per FAR 13.106-1(b)(1) negotiations will be conducted on a sole source basis with NRC as the only source meeting our needs and a purchase order will be issued without any additional notices being posted.

<DESC>Notification of Intent to Award a Sole Source Contract.  The Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), Office of Health Policy  intends to award a sole source contract to The Rockefeller Institute of Government, to analyze data gleaned from the Rockefeller Institute?s study to evaluate the relative effectiveness of faith-intensive versus secular providers of substance abuse treatment in Baltimore. The analysis shall primarily focus on determining the client benefits derived from participation in treatment services with varying degrees of faith content. The results of the data analysis shall also provide greater insight into the impact of receiving treatment on the utilization of social services, employment stability and marital relationships; and the validity of fitting treatment programs to the spiritual and socio-demographic profile of the client.  Questions on the studies data, which are of interest to ASPE, are: 1.What socio-demographic factors are associated with successful treatment outcomes for clients of faith-based and secular treatment programs? (Exploratory); 2. Are there any statistically significant findings related to the treatment outcomes of the participants in the faith-based programs in comparison with those in the secular programs? (Experimental); 3. Which factors appear to be associated with lower recidivism rates among study participants? (Exploratory); 4. Did rates of recidivism differ according to the treatment program?s degree of faith intensity? (Exploratory); 5. What effects, if any, did receiving treatment have on a participant?s involvement in the child welfare and criminal justice systems?  Were there differences by faith intensity of treatment? (Exploratory); 6. Are there any detectible differences in the utilization of social services and involvement in the criminal justice system associated with whether the participant received a faith-based or secular treatment? (Experimental); 7. Are there any statistically significant differences in marital stability over time between clients in the faith-based and secular programs? (Exploratory); 8. Are there differences in long- and short-term employment rates or welfare dependency among clients in faith-based versus secular forms of treatment? (Exploratory); and 9. What effects, if any, did the participation in faith-based versus secular treatment programs appear to have on the intensity of a client?s faith beliefs over time? (Exploratory).  

The Rockefeller Institute of Government project is the only study that possesses sufficient breadth and methodological rigor to measure the impact of faith components on substance abuse treatment outcomes.  Since this study was privately funded and is not available to the public, the Rockefeller Institute of Government is the only source that has access to and can analyze the information.  

Any firm that believes it may have similar capabilities is encouraged to submit their capability statement addressing each of the items/areas cited above. Written capability statements may not exceed ten (10) pages and must be received by the contracting officer not later than 10:00 a.m. EDT on September 10, 2007. Small Businesses are encouraged to review this notice. E-MAIL CAPABILITY STATEMENT TO: Marc.Long@psc.hhs.gov.  

The Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302-1. No solicitation document is available at this time. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed acquisition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. For further information, contact Marc Long at DHHS/PSC/SAS/DAM, Parklawn Building, Room 5-101, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857 or on 301-443-7086.

<DESC>NASA/NSSC has a requirement for cryogenic engineering training for approximately thirty technical professionals to take place on January 29, 2008 through February 1, 2008 at NASAs Kennedy Space Center.  The objectives of the course are to build a solid foundation in the fundamentals of cryogenics; encourage a "hands-on" approach to solving cryogenic problems; define and demonstrate "whats different" at low temperatures; and provide up-to-date cryogenic information.  The contractor shall be responsible for providing all course materials. NASA/NSSC intends to purchase these services from Cryoco, Inc., 511 Adams Avenue, Louisville, CO	80027.	Pursuant to FAR 13.106, the acquisition of these services has been determined to be reasonably available from only one source.  Competition is impractical for the following reasons:	(1) Cryoco and its staff are nationally recognized experts in the field of cryogenic engineering and can provide an existing training course to meet this training requirement: (2) Cryocos staff has previous experience providing similar cryogenic engineering training at the Kennedy Space Center and is knowledgeable about the Centers training needs in this discipline; and (3) Cryocos staff is able to provide the training during the requested dates. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on August 10, 2007.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency. An Ombudsman has been appointed:  See NASA Specific Note B. Any referenced notes may be viewed at the following URLs linked below.

<DESC>Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), Information Operations and Special Projects Division (HEX), Human Effectiveness Directorate (HE), seeks to design, fabricate, and test a source circuit and antenna combination that will radiate a very precise electromagnetic signal.  The signal radiated will approximate a square wave modulated sinusoid in the frequency range from three to six gigahertz.  The purpose of this laboratory device is to test and apply concepts and theories of electromagnetic transient formation that have developed over the past several years.   Extensive mathematical and experimental research has indicated that certain electromagnetic signals incident on materials, including human living tissue, can produce significant electrical field and current transients within the illuminated structure.  These transients can provide valuable information concerning the electromechanical or dielectric structure of the material.  Specifically, if the materials being studied is living tissue, analysis of the electromagnetic transiets may be able to diagnose certain adverse changes within the tissue.  This effort seeks to develop an engineering method for engendering these electromagnetic transients within specific materials, ultimately including human tissue.

<DESC>The U. S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) intends to issue a purchase order for one fully operational shipboard Sea-Tel Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) satellite communication system with 3.7 meter dish operating on global C-band, compatible with the existing Earth-station to NOAA?s Network Operation Center (NOC) connection for the NOAA Ship OKEANOS EXPLORER.  Purchase includes integration and installation of the system.  The Requirements specify that a Sea-Tel marine stabilized VSAT with 3.7 meter dish be provided.  The justification for specifying this brand name item follows at the end of this synopsis.
		NOAA intends to conduct this procurement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, and FAR Subpart 13.5, Test Program for Certain Commercial Items.  The Government believes the Sea-Tel 3.7 meter dish can only be provided by Sea-Tel dealers, as such the simplified acquisition is issued on a restricted basis for Sea-Tel dealers only on a best value basis.  The Request for Quote (RFQ) will be issued on or about August 6, 2007 with quotes due on or about August 20, 2007.   NOAA intends to make a single award as a result of this RFQ.  The NAIC code is 517410.  The RFQ will be issued via electronic posting at Federal Business Opportunity (FEDBIZOPPS) web page www.eps.gov.  Hard copies of the RFQ will not be issued.  It is incumbent upon interested parties wishing to submit a quote to monitor FEDBIZOPPS for the release of the RFQ, specification, drawings and all subsequent amendments.  The specification will be uploaded via www.eps.gov with the RFQ.   Vendors must be registered with the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov and obtain (and provide with the offer) a DUNs number.  All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. For information concerning the acquisition, please forward inquiries via e-mail to Melissa R. Sampson, Contract Specialist at Melissa.R.Sampson@noaa.gov or via telephone at (757) 441-6561.       
BRAND NAME JUSTIFICATION
(1) Contract Agency:  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Eastern Region Acquisition Division, Norfolk, VA  23510 has a requirement for one VSAT Satellite Communication System for the NOAA Ship OKEANOS EXPLORER, to include integration and installation.  This document covers the justification to include brand name descriptions in the acquisition; specifically, that the VSAT be a 3.7 meter marine stabilized dish from Sea-Tel.   

(2) Nature of Action being Approved:  NOAA intends to procure one Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT) Satellite Communication System for the NOAA Ship OKEANOS EXPLORER on a brand name specific basis pursuant to the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Subpart 6.302-1, entitled, ?Only One Responsible Source And No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements? and paragraph (c) entitled, ?Application for Brand Name Descriptions?.
(3) Description of Supplies/Services:  This Brand Name Justification covers the purchase of one, fully operational shipboard Sea Tel marine stabilized VSAT system with 3.7 meter dish and 16 foot diameter dome, operating on global circular C-band, compatible with the existing Earth-station to NOAA?s Network Operation Center (NOC) connection.  Purchase includes integration and installation of the system.  In addition, NOAA intends to purchase any necessary shore-side equipment required to establish a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or dedicated secure connection between the Earth Station Teleport and the NOAA Network (NOAA Net).  System shall be integrated to provide satellite connectivity to the ship?s video, Local Area Network (LAN), Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) lines network and Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANS).   This justification covers the inclusion of only the satellite communications system including the 3.7 meter dish and tracking/stabilization equipment.  

(4)  Authority Cited:  41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) as implemented by FAR 6.302-1.   
(5)  Reasons for Authority Cited:  The NOAA Ship OKEANOS EXPLORER is a dedicated telepresence vessel designed to provide multiple high definition video transmission simultaneously from deep in the ocean.  The ship is only 224 feet long with limited mast space available. Mast design and ship stability limits us to a dome of 16 feet diameter or smaller.  In order to meet the high bandwidth requirement of 21 mbps ship-to-shore on global circular C-band as cost effectively as possible, NOAA requires the largest stabilized marine VSAT that can fit inside a 16-foot diameter dome. The SeaTel 3.7 meter dish is the largest commercially available stabilized marine VSAT that uses a 16 foot diameter dome.  Larger dishes, up to 20 meters diameter, are common for land based application; however, they are not compatible for marine use as they can not track the satellite while the ship is in motion nor compensate for the ship?s heave, roll and pitch.
	The SeaTel 14600 series (3.7 meter) uses the same dish and dome as their 14400 series, which is used extensively by oil tankers and large cargo ships for television reception while far out to sea.  In addition, the system has many parts in common with the SeaTel 9797, 2.4 meter C-band VSAT, which NOAA already uses and supports in the fleet.  Because of this compatibility of parts with the 14400 and 9797, spare parts are less expensive and more readily available then they would be for a custom built or comparable system.  Also, since NOAA is already supporting SeaTel 9797?s on four of our ships, NOAA maintains a stockpile of spares and has technicians trained in operating and supporting the SeaTel 9797.  These existing spares and skills will reduce the annual cost of maintaining the 14600, both by saving time and money in training as well as requiring fewer dedicated spare parts than an incompatible system would require.  
	The 14400 and 14600 SeaTels are proven systems, currently used on civilian and military ships.  The series has a proven track record of reliability.  A custom built system would have unknown reliability, require buying or building unique spare parts and require specialized training to operate and maintain.  A custom built system would also require development time and significant development cost, time and money that can be saved by using this commercial off the shelf product.  NOAA does not possess the knowledge and expertise to determine what a suitable equal is for each part that comprises the VSAT ?system?.  Without identifiable salient characteristics, for at least the assembly and subassembly parts, NOAA can not ensure quality, form, fit and function.  Therefore, procuring on a ?Brand Name or Equal? basis without identifiable salient characteristics would be contrary to NOAA procedures and bring forth latent risks as to the integrity of parts.
	The SeaTel 14600 is American Made, and SeaTel has an extensive distribution network through out the NOAA area of operations.  SeaTel will not sell directly to the U.S. Government, but only through certified dealers.    
6)  Efforts to Obtain Competition:  Although not all Sea-Tel dealers offer the same Sea-Tel products; specifically a 3.7 meter dish, there are at least ten dealers who do offer this size dish commercially.  The requirement will be issued on FedBizOpps where all dealers have access and the opportunity to submit an offer.   The requirement for a small business to provide products from a small business manufacturer that itself did not manufacture negates conducting a small business set-aside.  Competition will however be sought from all Sea-Tel dealers. 
 (7) Fair and Reasonable Determination:  It is anticipated, based on competition among dealers that the cost to the Government will be fair and reasonable.
(8) Market Research Conducted:  Market research was conducted using the Internet to ensure that the most up-to-date data was considered as to availability commercially of a marine stabilized 3.7 meter dish.  Research was also conducted at the 2006 and 2007 Satellite Trade Show, which supports the Brand Name Description that Sea- Tel is the only company who manufacturers a commercially available marine stabilized 3.7 meter dish.  
(9) Any Other Supporting Facts:   
(10) Interested Sources:  Through market research, several Sea-Tel dealers expressed an interest in this requirement.
(11) Actions to Overcome Barriers to Competition:  The Satellite Communication Community is vast; however, as far as manufacturers of marine stabilized dishes above 2.8 meters diameter, the community shrinks considerably.  This is the only VSAT of this size expected to be purchased for the NOAA fleet.

<DESC>THIS IS A SOLE SOURCE SYNOPSIS!  The 45th Contracting Squadron has a sole source requirement for maintenance support service contract for the DEOMI EOSI GLAS electronic library catalog.  The period of performance is 1 October 07 through 30 September 2008.  Four one-year options may be awarded.  This is a Sole Source with Electronic Online Systems Intl. (EOS Intl.) IAW FAR 6.302-1.  EOS Intl. is the only source capable of fulfilling the governments requirement which is a logical follow on to a requirement that has been in place for over ten years.  EOS Intl. is the sole provider for the GLAS system software.  Changing to a different company at this time would require replacing all software modules with another company?s proprietary software in addition to the cost of migrating over 17,500 cataloging records to new software.  This would require an extremely large sum of money and therefore would not be cost effective for the government.  No solicitation document exists at this time.  This item/service utilizes Standard Industrial Code (SIC) 7379 with a business size of $23.0M and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code of 541519.  Interested firms may identify their capability to respond to this requirement.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes; however, the government will consider any responses from capable sources received within 10 days after date of publication of this synopsis.  45 CONS/LGCB has determined that EOS Intl. is the only source capable of providing this requirement.  Phone calls will not be accepted.  Point of contact is Bonnie Pruett, Contract Specialist, 45 CONS/LGCBB, 1201 Edward H.

The estimated value of this project is not available at this time. The reference for this project is RFP PEHAFGH0010. The U.S. Department of Commerce will be using as its reference IFIB-ISAF-PEH-AFGH-0010.

SCOPE OF PROJECT

Based on the expected useful economic life expectancy for the emergency construction containers in the ISAF HQ of 5-7 years, there will be an anticipated requirement to initiate a program for replacement.

In general, the companies will be required to do the following:

- Provide a baseline of the current situation of all the existing facilities now in use in the ISAF HQ compound, consisting of the function and/or use of each facility, type of construction, year built, the estimated end of economic usefulness of each facility in years, and a schedule and the associated estimated cost of the necessary replacements in-kind of the existing emergency construction facilities in the ISAF HQ.

- Provide the estimated cost and the estimated construction schedule to harden all the existing facilities, providing reinforced concrete roofs with skirts and blast walls on all the existing facilities.

- Provide the estimated cost and construction schedule to replace the emergency construction standard facilities within the ISAF HQ compound, including hardening to a specified threat.

- Evaluate the adequacy of existing construction and buildings, and provide the estimated cost for any remedial measures, if required.

- Compare solutions, exploring the advantages and disadvantages of each.

The type of information to be distributed to firms to enable them to bid is expected to be NATO UNCLASSIFIED.

BIDDING PROCEDURE

The U.S. Department of Commerce does not serve as the Host Nation for NATO projects. Its role is to approve for bidding those firms of NATO-member nations with a facility located within the United States. Only firms approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce will be allowed to bid.

<DESC>The National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), has a requirement to procure the services of Lindsay A.Walker of Greenbelt, MD.  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain will be performed and the imaging findings will be related to the results of standardized neuropsychological tests.  This study will enroll approximately 500 children, ranging from infancy to young adulthood, who will be seen at different time points over a six-year period. Within the context of this project a Diffusion Tensor Data Processing Center (DPC) was created in our laboratory.  Our role is to process and analyze all diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) data that will be acquired by the various Centers during the course of the study.  We will send processed data to the central Data Coordinating Center (DCC) for subsequent inclusion in the pediatric neuroimaging database. This contractor shall perform required tasks related to organizing MRI data, visually inspect image data and output, and assess quality, interact with staff who will be setting up a database for organizing the data locally, use existing software for standardized processing of images, maintain a database for image record keeping and tracking purposes, perform analysis of population data for testing of general neurodevelopmental hypotheses, and compare and contrast ROI based methods for image analysis with other methods that will be developed by investigators and collaborators of the DPC. This contractor must have a publication record in the field of diffusion tensor data analysis in pediatric subjects, proving the ability to develop original strategies for addressing questions arising in assessing brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders.

<DESC>This proposed procurement is a follow-on for training in the Automated Cost Estimating Integrated Tools (ACEIT) cost estimating spreadsheet environment; an implementation of NAFCOM and QuickCost in ACEIT; ACEIT course training; adaptation of the traditional qualitative 5X5 risk matrix assessment into ACEIT for cost-risk quantification; integration of a NASA-unique resource time-phasing Function (f(x)) into ACEIT; and, cost estimating support using ACEIT The Government intends to solicit and negotiate on a sole source basis with Tecolote Research, Inc. a leading provider of independent cost analysis and other complex financial management services to the Department of Defense (DoD) and Federal Government.  Tecolote has been designated as a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner (MCP) and the proprietary owner of the ACEIT Training.   NASA has used Tecolotes ACEIT for the past three years. Tecolote has provided NASA Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) /CAD cost estimators with training and support in the use ACEIT during those three years.  Tecolote developed the ACEIT cost estimating environment tool for the U.S. government almost 25 years ago and is the most knowledgeable cost support contractor in its use, training, support, update and maintenance.  Over the past three years, Tecolote has performed extremely valuable on-the-job ACEIT mechanics training for NASA cost estimators on their NASA-specific project cost estimates. This type of ACEIT training is not offered by any other cost support contractor except Tecolote.   Finally, this proposed task requires the implementation of a NASA-unique time-phasing methodology and adaptation of the traditional qualitative 5X5 risk matrix methodology for quantitative identification of cost-risk impacts that, since Tecolote developed ACEIT, only Tecolote can add to ACEITs functionality. Tecolote shall provide ACEIT mechanics training to Headquarters (HQ) PA&E/Cost Analysis Division (PA&E/CAD).  The contractor shall also provide as part of the ACEIT mechanics training ACEIT implementation support to HQs PA&E/CAD analysts for ACEIT implementation of NAFCOM and QuickCost in ACEIT; CAD independent cost estimates (ICEs); integration of external cost estimating methodologies into ACEIT; adaptation of traditional qualitative 5X5 Risk Matrix for cost-risk quantification; and reviews of PA&E/IPAO milestone-driven flight project ICEs.

The Visualyse software package is accepted and used by regional and international radio frequency regulators, following International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommendations, and has been used in many frequency recommendation papers presented at ITU Working Groups, Plenipotentiary Conference, and the World Radiocommunication Conference.  The Visualyse software package has been accepted by the ITU as being able to carry out the analysis required to determine the need for coordination between satellite and ground based systems in accordance with ITU-Radiocommunication (ITU-R) Handbook and Publications.  ITU-R Handbook and Publications are text which provides a statement of the current knowledge, the present position of studies, or of good operating or technical practice, in certain aspects of radiocommunications, which should be addressed to a radio engineer, system planner or operating official who plans, designs or uses radio services or systems, paying particular attention to the requirements of developing countries.  The Visualyse software package meets the recommendations of the ITU-R Handbook and ITU-R Publications; 1) Radiowave propagation - SG03, 2) Fixed-satellite service - SG04, 3) Broadcasting services - SG06, 4) Science Services - SG07, 5) Mobile Radiodetermination, Amateur and Related Satellite Services - SG08, and 6) Fixed Service - SG09.  The ITU-R Handbook and ITU-R Publications may be obtained from the ITU at http://www.itu.int/publications/publications.aspx?lang=en&parent=R-HDB&selection=7?or=1 
Vendors who believe they can satisfy the Government?s requirements are invited to submit an affirmative response.  To be considered an affirmative response, vendors must submit written data and documentation that reflect meeting the aforementioned requirements for ITU compliance.  All responsible sources must submit a written narrative statement of capability including detailed technical information and other technical literature sufficient to permit agency analysis in order to determine a bona fide capability to meet the requirements.  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement for competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within its discretion.  Affirmative responses must be received within 30 days after publication of this synopsis.   SEE Note 22.

<DESC>This publication serves as notice of intent to negotiate a sole source simplified acquisition with the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin to provide two Multi-Functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) 10-bit High Resolution Information Transmission (HRIT) satellite data ingestor systems and support. The ingestors must provide data output in McIDAS format which is used at NOAA?s Weather Service offices (NWS) in Guam and Honolulu to convert and display locally ingested images on the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS), the official NWS system used to support forecast and warning operations. MTSAT 8-bit High Resolution Imager Data will be discontinued in December 2007, replaced by new 10-bit High Resolution Information Transmission (HRIT) data. Therefore, these two new systems are necessary in order to ingest MTSAT data beyond December 2007. The Government believes that only the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University of Wisconsin has the capability to process the new MTSAT 10-bit HRIT data in McIDAS format.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered.

<SOLNBR>RFQ-DC-07-00273
<RESPDATE>081107
<ARCHDATE>09112007
<CONTACT>Point of Contact, Ryan Daniels, Purchasing Agent, Phone (202) 564-4467
<DESC>NAICS Code: 332994   The OECA/OCEFT Criminal Investigations Division (CID) under the authority of the Federal Acquisition Rules (FAR) Part 13, Simplified Acquisition Procedures, intends to issue a sole source purchase order to Glock, Inc. for (200) G19FGR firearms with extended mag catch, Trijicon Night Sights, Extended Slide Stop Lever, and NY Trigger.  The justification for a sole source purchase order is as follows.  CID needs a reliable, proven handgun in order to dispatch their law enforcement duties.  The weapons must be reliable, easy to handle, relatively small, and must  allow for concealment.  The guns need to be 9mm, medium size, polymer frame, semi-automatic pistols capable of a 15 round magazine.  They must have 3 safeties, full double action safe action trigger configured to optional 7.5 to 8.8 lbs pull, 4.02  inch Hexagonal profile barrel with right hand  twist, 3 dot sighting system w/night sights, delivered with 3 magazines, and a carry/lock box.  Empty weight is approximately 20.99 ounces.  Currently, CID needs to purchase new handguns for its criminal enforcement agents.  The current weapons are approaching 15 years in age and are at or near the  end of the effective warranty period.  These weapons are necessary equipment, allowing CID's agents to perform their sworn duties as members of the law enforcement community.  The CID has made Glock the Agency standard weapon and CID agents have received numerous hours of training and instruction  on this particular handgun.  The familiarity of using a certain kind of weapon is vital to its proper use in the field or in the course of duty.  In addition, to retool would require a substantial extra expenditure of time, effort, and money by EPA's CID.  By merely updating the pistols on hand, as  they are nearing the end of the manufacturer's recommended life expectancy (15 years/45000 rounds) the government saves a substantial amount of money as the Glock is the only pistol that already fits CID's training, certified repair technicians, and equipment capabilities.  NO SOLICITATION OR  REQUEST FOR QUOTE IS AVAILABLE.  Notwithstanding, any firm that believes it is capable of meeting this requirement may submit a response, which if received within two days of the closing date of this announcement, will be considered.  Responses to this announcement must be in writing to the  contracting officer at daniels.ryan@epa.gov.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 334516   Synopsis to Furnish and Install, a Universal Online Gas Preparation and Introduction System with Associated Peripherals and Consumables to Upgrade a Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus Isotope Ratio Mass-Spectrometer (IRMS) with GCIII Continuous Flow and ConFlo III system    The  U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of the test program for commercial items (section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act), with Thermo Electron North America, LLC, to furnish and install, a universal online gas preparation and introduction system with associated  peripherals and consumables to upgrade the IRMS, at the National Risk Management Research Laboratory (NRMRL) located at the U.S. EPA's AWBERC Facility in Cincinnati, Ohio.    The NRMRL currently uses a Thermo Finnigan Delta Plus Isotope Ratio Mass-Spectrometer  with GCIII Continuous Flow and  ConFlo III system interface for sample introduction in continuous flow mode. This IRMS setup is being integrated, operated, and controlled by a computer running Thermo Finnigan's ISODAT 2.0 software. The existing IRMS system was purchased in 1998.  The instrument is currently 9 years old and  upgrades are required to maintain functionality and extend the life of the current instrumentation.    The NRMRL requires the capability to analyze for Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Hydrogen isotopes in solid, liquid, tissue, and gas samples. The NRMRL also requires increased sample throughput of  its existing analysis by replacing difficult, time consuming, and costly manual sample preparation procedures with automated and on-line sample preparation techniques.    To fill these requirements the NRMRL has specified a series of upgrades and additional peripheral modules to be added to the  existing IRMS system.  These include the following primary components along with other peripherals, consumables and training: 1.	Finnigan Gas Bench II  2.	Finnigan H-Device 3.	Dual inlet system including changeover valve- internal component of the IRMS sold and installed by the manufacturer  only. 4.	H/D ion collector and amplifier assembly- internal component of the IRMS sold and installed by the manufacturer only.    Under this procurement, the contractor shall furnish and install, on a turnkey basis, a universal online gas preparation and introduction system, with associated  peripherals and consumables as well as all physical connections, communication hardware components, proprietary software modifications and training needed to integrate it with NRMRL's IRMS.    Thermo Electron North America, LLC is the designated sales, maintenance and repair company for the  NRMRL's IRMS. They are also solely responsible for the design manufacture and programming of the existing IRMS.  Subsequently, U. S. EPA has determined Thermo Electron North America, LLC to be the only contractor qualified to perform the work.    This procurement will be accomplished under FAR  Part 12 Commercial Procedures. Interested firms may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirements. THIS NOTICE OF INTENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE QUOTATIONS. A determination by the Government not to compete this acquisition based upon responses to this notice is  solely within the discretion of the Government. Sources wishing to be considered MUST submit documentation to the office identified above. Documentation must be submitted within 15 calendar days of the date of publication of this notice. Submit your request in writing to Michael Kreacic at the  above address or by fax to 513-487-2107 or by e-mail to kreacic.michael@epa.gov. Telephone requests will not be honored.

GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS - The USDA, ARS, Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit (PSWMRU) in University Park, Pennsylvania, requires the Contractor to furnish and deliver a new Simultaneous Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES), components and accessories.  This system which is controlled by a personal computer will be used for analysis for aqueous samples for P, Ca, Fe, Al, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Si, Na, Zn, Pb, S, As, Se, Cd, and Ni.  SALIENT CHARACTERISTICS - The USDA, ARS,(PSWMRU) has determined that Varian Inc?s. Simultaneous Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES), components and accessories is the only equipment with the following salient characteristics:  Following are the unique specifications for the axially viewed simultaneous ICP-OES system that is required for the analysis of the aqueous samples referred to above.   The requested Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer must have the following features:  a. It must be compact and bench mounted (i.e. sets on a lab bench). The entire system must fit into a footprint not greater than 6.5 inches long by 4 feet wide.  Location of equipment:  1st floor, PSWMRU Water Quality Laboratory (Penn State University).   b. The instrument must be truly simultaneous (i.e., all analytes of interest over the emission range of 167-785nm from ppb to % level must be measured at the same time).  c. It must be fitted with an axially viewed plasma using a cooled cone interface. d. The polychromator must be purged with argon to allow for the analysis of low wavelength emission lines (<185nm).  e. It must be fitted with a free-running air-cooled 40 MHz RF generator. f. The polychromator must be thermostatted to 35?C, and be under full PC control via a true 32 bit multi-tasking and multi-threading software environment compatible with Windows XP or higher.   g. Contractor must supply 1 axially viewed simultaneous ICP atomic emission spectrometer with 4 channel peristaltic pump, mass flow controller, and software package.  h. Contractor must supply appropriate recirculating water cooling device.  i. Contractor must supply autosampler with a minimum one standard rack and one sample rack having a minimum of 60 sample positions; sampler must be expandable to handle up to 400 sample positions in addition to standards.  j.

<DESC>Expression of Interest (EOI) for Treatment of DWPF Recycle Waste.  
This EOI is issued in an effort to identify potential sources and technologies for the treatment of radioactive liquid waste.  The anticipated future work scope will involve the design, fabrication, installation, and testing of  equipment and support systems to treat liquid waste at a designated location on the Savannah River Site, (SRS), (a U.S. Department of Energy facility), located near Aiken, South Carolina.

The waste streams involved have been determined not to be high-level waste and can be treated and disposed of as low-level waste. Currently, our Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) generates approximately 1.5 million gallons of recycle water annually as a result of its vitrification of high level radioactive sludge salt waste.  The recycle water is being returned to our tank farm.  This amount is anticipated to increase to approximately 2.5 million gallons annually.  We are looking for a method for treating this waste stream that will result in the elimination of the recycle water from having to be returned to our tank farm, but instead, enable it to be sent through existing piping systems to our SRS - Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) for further treatment and disposition, or sent to our SRS -  H12 Outfalls for disposition.

Three methods are currently being considered: 1.) using an evaporator, 2.) using a filter and ion exchange, or 3.) using an effluent treatment process.  We are not limiting our options to only these three methods.  Other viable methods that might be proposed for consideration will be welcomed.

If your firm is interested in participating in this EOI, please respond by email to:  ken.rothgeb@srs.gov .  Provide your complete company name, address, telephone number, fax. number, contact person, and email address.  Upon receipt of your response we will contact you so more detailed EOI information can be sent to you.

<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) intends to award a contract to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). 

There are unique environmental conditions which exist in refugee or displaced persons camps that make water and sanitation critical issues in maintaining the health of these populations. Many of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity in these populations can be traced to poor sanitation and inadequate water quantity and quality. 

The purpose of this contract is to help identify the most effective point of use water treatment and sanitation interventions for application in emergency and post emergency settings in camps run by the UNHCR. 

In helping to achieve this goal the following tasks will be performed: Identify leading interventions, refine existing interventions for use in emergency and post emergency settings, provide laboratory assessment of water borne pathogens, produce training materials for primary interventions, hold a meeting of key stakeholders to identify gaps in service, provide logistics support in the field in at least two emergency affected countries for CDC field teams, produce a final report with summary recommendations

It is imperative to utilize UNHCR for this contract.  UNHCR has the global mandate under the United Nations for these health topics and these refugee camps. By international law they are the only organization which can do this work.   

The North American Industry Classification Code is 924110.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals, but all replies received within 15 days of publication will be considered.  A determination not to compete based on responses received and to proceed with a noncompetitive award is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>The Uniformed Services University plans on issuing a Sole Source contract to BD Biosciences Immun. Systems for a BD LSR II flow cytometer three laser system research flow cytometer cell analyzer, capable of detecting 8 fluorescent parameters with the following lasers 488nm(20mW), 633nm(18mW) and 405nm(50mW).  

The basis for the sole source decision follows:  

The instrument selected must be compatible with the current instrumentation in the Flow Cytometry Facility. The facility currently has a BD LSR II that fulfills many of the requirements of current research protocols. Instrument time is the greatest limiting factor. A second BD LSR II is requested because it will enable the BD High Throughput Sampler (HTS) to be used to acquire samples from 96 well plates. The second LSR II will afford greater flexibility without mandating additional training to operate a different instrument with new software.  Additionally, the selected instrument must have the following lasers; 488nm(20mW), 633nm(18mW) and 405nm(50mW) to fulfill the requirements of current research protocols. It must have a minimum of 8 fluorescent detectors and have the flexibility for expansion to 18 fluorescent detectors. It must have spatially separated lasers, a fixed laser alignment, automated compensation, and offline compensation capability.

<DESC>The Social Security Administration (SSA) anticipates awarding a sole source contract to the National Association of Public Health Statistics and Information Systems to utilize the Electronic Verification of Vital Events (EVVE) system.  NAPHSIS is a national association of state vital records and public health statistics offices which is based in the Washington, DC area, and is a not for profit agency.

NAPHSIS will survey all of the states and territories to determine which have birth records in electronic format.  NAPHSIS will develop a project plan, provide an electronic query process using an internet-based XML system to confirm vital records data, provide functional requirements for routing requests and responses, develop a roll-out plan to include all states, and produce functional requirements for consolidated billing.  NAPHSIS is the only source capable of providing the support that is needed to market EVVE to the state registrars and support the nationwide rollout.

Vendors capable of meeting SSA?s requirements to utilize the EVVE system must present electronic/written evidence of such capability by close of business on August 3, 2007. The Government does not intend to pay for information received and does not intend to provide evaluation results to the sender.

JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION

Part I:  Background information and Description of Acquisition

Title:  FACS ARIA cell sorter (special order research project)

Purpose/Brief History:

The FACS Core Facility provides flow cytometry and cell sorting support for the laboratories in the NCI Center for Cancer Research. The FACS Core has one FACS Vantage sorter (BD Biosciences, installed 2001) and one FACS Aria sorter (BD, installed 2004). In this time, both have provided reliable and consistent service to investigators in over 30 NCI labs and branches. Some of the applications routinely used on the two instruments are sorting murine immune cells, hematopoietic stem cells, keratinocytes, melanocytes, thyroid, mammary, liver, and epithelial cells into subsets based on antigen expression; sorting cell lines expressing fluorescent proteins after transfection; sorting cell lines in specific phases of the cell cycle compartment; sorting yeast and mammalian antibody-expressing cells for antibody libraries; and sorting individual cells for single cell PCR. Sorted cells are used for in vitro biochemical or functional assays and for in vivo assays following injection into mice or zebrafish.

A number of CCR laboratories have begun looking at cancer stem cells in a variety of tissue types and cell lines, both murine and human. Cancer stem cells were first identified in leukemia in 1994.  Since then, investigators have been attempting to identify cancer stem cells in solid tumors.  Many tumors express surface proteins, identifiable on a cell sorter like the FACS Aria using well-characterized monoclonal antibodies, which are also expressed on normal cells. It may be the expression patterns of combinations of these proteins that mark them as the undifferentiated cancer stem cell. Identification of and separation of these putative cancer stem cells in numbers needed for further characterization is possible only with the flow cytometer/cell sorter. However, because most solid tumors do not yet have well-defined surface markers specific to malignant cells, one popular method of sorting potential cancer stem cells is by their SP (side population) phenotype which is detected by using the UV-excitable Hoechst dye.  These SP cells, as well as the non-SP cells, can be sorted and used for clonogenic assays in in-vitro culture systems or can be injected into mice to test their ability to form new tumors. Sorted purified cells can also be used to determine their constitutive membrane and signaling proteins. 

Presently, the FACS Vantage is the only sorter in the FACS Core that is equipped with a UV laser. SP cells are present in very low frequencies (less than 1%) in most cell populations so sorting these cells to obtain sufficient numbers requires many hours. The FACS Aria is a compact benchtop cell sorter equipped with small air-cooled lasers that do not require water lines or 220v electric lines. The  FACS Aria special order research project model has a 355 nm UV laser, a 488 nm laser and a 638 nm laser allowing multi-parameter measurements of cell surface expressed proteins in conjunction with the SP phenotype. 

The FACS ARIA special order research project sorter uses the same software and reagents for operation and quality control as the existing instruments in the FACS Core Lab. The ARIA will be equipped with an aerosol management system for operator safety.
 
PART II:  Facts and reasons to Justify Other than Full and Open Competition

Statutory authority FAR 13.106(b)(1)

b) Soliciting from a single source. 

(1)  For purchases not exceeding the simplified acquisition threshold, contracting officers may solicit from one source if the contracting officer determines that the circumstances of the contract action deem only one source reasonably available (e.g., urgency, exclusive licensing agreements, or industrial mobilization). 
(2)  For sole source acquisitions of commercial items in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold conducted pursuant to subpart 13.5, the requirements at 13.501(a) apply.

Justification:

The BD Biosciences FACS Aria cell sorter is the only fixed alignment cell sorter with air-cooled lasers and a UV option that will allow the CCR to expand their capabilities for sorting and multi-parameter analysis.  This FACS Aria is compatible with the FACS Core Facilities existing BD Bioscience equipment and will permit the use of its existing methodologies, and software programs.

<DESC>***The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for CAST POLYURETHANE AND BORON CARBIDE POWDER SHIELD COMPONENTS to be used in the NIST Center for Neutron Research (NCNR), Gaithersburg, MD. 

BACKGROUND:

A new instrument is being built at NIST that will employ Polyurethane and Boron Carbide (UBC) to reduce the background present from interfering with the sensitive spectroscopic measurements. Polyurethane contains abundant neutron absorbing Hydrogen while Boron is a material that is strongly neutron absorbent. Neutron travel is unimpeded through thin sections of most materials. However, the more Hydrogen in a given substance, the more a given Neutron will be slowed down. Ultimately, the neutrons are traveling slow enough to be easily captured by the Boron.

This requirement is concerned with the process of translating the full 3-dimensional specification, which is submitted in the form of International Graphics Exchange Standard (IGES) files into solid castings composed of a mixture of polyurethane and Boron Carbide powder.  Twenty-two (22) sets of four (4) identical parts combine to make this portion of the single shielding system required for this instrument.  The requirement also includes the casting of one (1) unique component.

The recommended manufacturing technique is casting of the monolithic parts. Operations requiring machining are not recommended due to the very great hardness of Boron Carbide.

****Due to the necessity for this solicitation to include attachments (drawings), which the FBO website does not support for combined synopses/solicitations, this pre-solicitation notice will be immediately (27 July 2007) followed with an uplaoded combined sysnopsis/solicitation as well as the referenced drawings.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

The goal of this requirement is to encourage and support the expansion of hazard, disaster and emergency management related education in colleges and universities across the United States so that in the future more emergency management and related personnel in government and the private sector will come to the job not only with a college education, but with a course of study, if not a degree, in emergency management as well.  Because emergency management is a multidisciplinary field of study, this helps contribute to the professionalization of emergency management and the expansion of emergency management knowledge and principles into other professions and disciplines as well-all of which contributes to building disaster resistant and resilient communities of tomorrow.  Toward that end, EMI, located at the NETC in Emmitsburg, Maryland, developed the Higher Education Project, the primary purpose of which is to encourage and support the development of hazard, disaster and emergency management bachelor and graduate degree programs within the United States colleges and universities.  Each Emergency Management Higher Education Project course shall be developed within the philosophical context of (1) building disaster resistant and resilient communities, and (2) seeking balance between the technocratic and the social vulnerability reduction approaches to emergency management.  Please refer to the Higher Education Project Slide Presentation at the following website address:  http://training.fema.gov/EMIweb/edu/highedbrief_course2.ppt.  A listing of the completed Emergency Management Higher Education Project courses can be found at the following website: http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/highedbief_course2ppt.  Additional information concerning the Emergency Management Higher Education Project can be accessed at:  http://training.fema.gov/EMIWeb/edu/aem_courses.htm.

<DESC>The National Children?s Study (NCS) is a major longitudinal cohort study that will follow children from before birth to at least 21 years of age and will evaluate the effects of a variety of environmental factors, including chemical, physical, biological, and psychosocial factors, on children?s health and well-being.  Researchers will analyze how these elements interact with each other and what helpful and/or harmful effects they might have on children?s health.  Data will be collected from children and their families from different areas of the country, from varied backgrounds, and of different family types.  

In order to study the main hypotheses for the National Children?s Study, a variety of data will be collected from participants, including biological specimens.  Biospecimens from a potential mother, father, and/or child will either be collected by a data collector or self collected by the participant and will take place at defined time periods or visits during the study. The visits are defined as Pre-Pregnancy (P1), First Trimester Pregnancy (T1), Third Trimester Pregnancy (T3), Birth (B) and 1, 3, 6, or 12 months after the child is born (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 12 Months).  Study centers from across the nation will manage the data collection within their area and will work with the Program Office (National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Centers for Disease Control (CDC)) and the Coordinating Center (Westat) to meet the needs of the study.  The study will begin with 7 Vanguard Centers but will add on study centers over the first 11 years of the study to reach approximately 105 study locations.  In order to guarantee consistency of data collection across the study locations and between participants, the study plans to make use of pre-made biospecimen collection kits.  This will help streamline biospecimen collection and ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and good quality control in the field.  Biospecimen collection is an important part of this study and will require meticulous attention to detail as well as continuous efforts by the vendor to ensure that specific protocols for biospecimen kit production are followed.  The contents of each kit will require close attention to specific component labeling, tracking, and shipping as described in the following sections.

The equipment listed in this procurement have been identified as key components of the Department of State infrastructure.  Use of third party equipment which has not been tested by the Department nor been proven in field use may result in equipment conflicts, increase the complexity of integrationn, and may not be compatible with the Department of State network requirements. IRM/OPS/PMA has identified the equipment in this procurement as a key component of the Department's infrastructure. The equipment is required to provide network connectivity to existing Department of State's enterprise network infrastructure based on existing management tools and routing capabilities that requires two critical protocols supported only by Cisco network switches; HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol).  Furthermore, APC Smart-UPS is an IRM ITCCB approved hardware and used to provide power protection for several years.  Use of third party equpment which has not been tested by the Department for compatibility with existing hardware and software at this time will cause unacceptable delays to the Program in support of the unclassified and classified IT refresh. As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractor's unique qualificatioins are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Department's requiremtns as a key compontent of the Department's networking system. The equipment listed have undergone testing, assessment, and evaluation for compatibility with existing hardware and software and is approved for use by the IRM ITCCB for unclassified and classified network.<BR><BR>AMENDED RFID TAGGING INSTRUCTIONS IN THE ATTACHMENT.<BR><BR>

Selection Process:

The selection process shall be in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 36, Subpart 36.6, Performance-Based Contracting, and the Brooks Act (Public Law 92-852). Clarifications may be requested at any time.  The selection process will be accomplished in two phases: 

Phase 1: Screening Phase: during which the SF330 will be evaluated against the selection factor 1-5 listed below to select the most highly qualified firms (the Short List) for continued participation in the procurement process. 

The letter notifying those firms selected for the short list will contain an appointment for one-on-one due diligence sessions with the Agency staff.  Expenses for due diligence will not be reimbursed. For planning purposes, it is anticipated that these sessions will be conducted in the Region?s offices and shall not take longer than two (2) hours.  In preparation for their due diligence session, firms should review the websites listed in the SOO. 

Phase 2: Selection Phase:  during which the short-listed firms will be invited to submit additional information and make oral presentations pursuant to FAR 36.602-3(c).  The additional information will consist of a comprehensive Project Management Plan (PMP), Technical Work Plan (TWP), and a Quality Management Plan (QMP) that address the firm?s solution to meeting the SOO.  The page limit for the plans (total) is 75 pages.  The plans will be reviewed before oral presentations.  

Each of the short-listed firms shall be given an opportunity for oral presentation, which shall be made by the firm?s key personnel/management team.  After reviewing the Phase 2 submission, a letter will be sent to each of the short listed firms scheduling a date for the firm?s oral presentation and containing a list of questions covering the Phase 2 submission.  Each firm is responsible for ensuring that any required presentation tools and personnel are available and working properly for their presentation.  During the oral presentation, the short-listed firms may be requested to provide further clarification concerning their submission.  After oral presentations, the firms will be evaluated and ranked, based on the information presented in their Phase II submission and Oral presentation. 

Selection factor 1-6 listed below will be used for making the final selection(s).  

Unsuccessful firms and firms selected for negotiation of a contract will be notified.

Negotiations will be conducted beginning with the most highly ranked firms in the selection and will proceed until sufficient awards have been made.

Selection Factor:
Six (6) factor will be used in the selection of firms.  Factor 1 through 5 will be used to evaluate firm?s SF-330s during Phase 1.  Factor 1, 2 and 3 are considered critical and are of equal value; Factor 4 and 5 are less important than Factor 1, 2 and 3, and are listed in descending order of importance.  Subfactors are of equal importance.  In addition to Factor 1 through 5, Factor 6 will be used to evaluate the firm?s Phase 2 submission (PMP, TWP, and QMP) during Phase 2.  Factor 6 is less important than factor 1, 2 and 3 and more important than Factor 4 and 5.  Should the content of a firm?s PMP, TWP, and QMP impact any of the Phase 1 ratings, the ratings for Phase 1 shall be revised as appropriate.

<SOLNBR>HTC711-07-Q-0123
<RESPDATE>081007
<ARCHDATE>08252007
<CONTACT>Paula Teague, Contract Specialist, Phone 618-256-9601, Fax 618-256-7060, Email paula.teague@ustranscom.mil
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION HTC711-07-Q-0123 is issued for informational and planning purposes only.  The information requested by this synopsis will be used within United States Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM) to facilitate decision making and will not be disclosed outside the agency.  Please note that USTRANSCOM will not be responsible for any costs incurred by interested parties in responding to this Request For Information (RFI).  USTRANSCOM requires listings of products and services that will be required to support / execute / perform / and provide the Defense Courier Service Surface Conveyance Tracking System for 52 Government owned vehicles worldwide. 

1.  PURPOSE.  The purpose of this RFI is to obtain technical information regarding tracking capabilities for surface conveyances such as vans and trucks.  

2. BACKGROUND:  The Defense Courier Surface (DCS) is responsible for delivery of sensitive materials in several parts of the world.  In many cases, DCS-owned surface assets such as vans and trucks are used to deliver these items.

To help ensure the security and safe delivery of these materials, DCS is investigating options for the tracking and monitoring of its surface deliveries.  This RFI solicits from commercial vendors descriptions of capabilities and technologies that DCS might leverage to that end.

3.  HIGH-LEVEL DESIRED CAPABILITIES DESCRIPTION.  Vendor responses to this RFI should describe proposed technologies and capabilities that could be used to support the DCS conveyance tracking desired capabilities listed below.

a)	The capability should enable monitoring of DCS vans and trucks.  A ?conveyance manager? should be able to sit at an office workstation, display a geographic area of interest, and ? using that geographical display - show the last reported location of any DCS conveyances making deliveries in that region.
b)	The conveyance should automatically report its location at flexible time periods.  For example, highly sensitive deliveries might require position reports every 5 minutes; while less sensitive deliveries might require position reports every 30 minutes.
c)	The conveyance manager should automatically be alerted if the conveyance deviates significantly from an assigned route or if the conveyance falls significantly behind schedule.  The conveyance manager should be able to define business rules for route and schedule deviation, and other business rules that might be appropriate.
d)	The driver of the conveyance should have a capability to contact the conveyance manager in case of emergency.
e)	The conveyance should have the ability to connect other sensors to the system e.g. door opening, security cage breech and tip over/roll over sensors and relay information from these sensors to alert the conveyance manager when activated.
f)	The conveyance should include the ability to activate remote devices installed on the vehicle e.g. remote vehicle disabling, remote door lock/unlock.
g)	The driver of the conveyance should have a ?panic button? available in case of emergency.
h)	The conveyance should alert the conveyance manager automatically if the conveyance tips over
i)	Information from the conveyance tracking solution should be generically exportable to other software applications or systems as needed by DCS.
j)	Coverage.  The capability should be able to track DCS deliveries in the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii, Korea, Japan, Italy, and Western Europe.

4.  INFORMATION SOUGHT FROM VENDORS.  A description of technical solutions from vendors ? as they apply to the above desired capabilities ? should include the following as a minimum:

a)	Description of equipment.  Equipment required for the conveyance, equipment required for the conveyance manager, network/comms equipment, etc.
b)	Description of equipment installation requirements.  For example, can an untrained user install the equipment?  Or does equipment installation require vendor technicians?  What is the level of effort to install each piece of equipment recommended to meet requirements?
c)	Description of technologies involved in the solution
d)	An architecture description.  For example, how is conveyance location data transmitted from the conveyance to the conveyance manager?
e)	Technology limitations.  For example, are there ?dead zones? in the geographic areas listed above where the conveyance would be unable to transmit a position?
f)	Interoperability description.  For example, is the equipment capable of running additional third-party software, such as navigation software or status reporting software?
g)	Description of information provided to the conveyance manager.  For example, position and date-time.  Would the conveyance provide any additional information such as vehicle speed, weather conditions, etc?
h)	Description of the solution?s ability to handle the following situations:
a.	Driver Panic alert
b.	Equipment failure to communicate
c.	Telemetry alerts (i.e., door or other intrusion sensors)
i)	Description of your service?s abiliaty to interface with a government GIS system rather than providing visual access directly to the user.
j)	Estimated costs for:
a.	Equipment
b.	Equipment Installation
c.	Equipment transmission
These estimates are to be based on the following parameters:
- 300 tracking events (road delivery missions) per month
- Each tracking event requires tracking for approximately eight (8) hours
- Geographically dispersed in the following areas:
	- Continental United States (80%) 264 missions per month
	- Japan (8%) 24 Missions per month
	- Western Europe (12% ) 12 missions monthly in UK, 23 within Continental Europe

5. FORMAT FOR RFI:  The format for submittal of your RFI is outlined below.  

a)	Pages 8.5 x 11 inches in size, single or double spaced, margins not less than one inch all around, one-sided printing, pages numbered, in at least 10 point type;

In support of Sub-factor (B), the offeror shall identify each subconsultant by name, discipline and size status and also identify, in terms of dollar values and percentage of total proposed price, the extent of work you will perform as the prime contractor.  The offeror is advised that the Government-wide goals for the total value of all prime contracts per fiscal year are 23% to SB, 5% each to SDB, WOSB and 3% each to HUBZone SB and SDVOSB, and 5% to HBCU/MI.  In addition, the Naval Facilities Engineering Command FY 07 subcontracting targets in term of dollar value of subcontracts are 76.07% to SB, 15.88% to SDB, 14.22% to WOSB, 1.29% to HUBZone SB and .13% to SDVOSB.  FAR 52.219-8, Utilization of Small, Small Disadvantaged and Women-Owned Small Business Concerns states in part; the Contractor hereby agrees to carry out this policy in the awarding of subcontracts to the fullest extent consistent with efficient contract performance.  If the offeror does not intend to subcontract, provide a detailed explanation why subcontracting would not result in efficient contract performance.  The offerors are reminded that in order to receive proposal evaluation benefit as SDB or HUBZone SB either as prime or subconsultant, proposed SDBs and HUBZoneSBs must be certified by the Small Business Administration.  Prime contractors may determine whether a prospective subconsultant is a certified SDB or HUBZone by accessing the Central Contractor Registration (CCR) at www.ccr.gov.  The Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) will require the use of On-Line Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) in Federal solicitations as part of the proposal submission process.  Offerors are required to complete the ORCA on-line via website http://orca.bpn.gov.   Refer to FAR Clauses 52.204-7 Central Contractor Registration (July 2006) and 52.204-8 Annual Representations and Certifications (Jan 2006).  The selected firm, its subsidiaries or affiliates that design or prepare specifications for a construction contract cannot provide the construction services for the same contract.  This includes concept design, which includes preparation of project programming documents (DD1391), facility sitting studies, environmental assessments, or other activities that result in identification of project scope and cost.  The prime firm and consultants for this contract will be required to perform throughout the contract term.  A-E firms meeting the requirements described in this announcement are invited to submit a completed Standard Form 330, Architect Engineer Qualifications.

<SUBJECT>59 -- SCBA O2 Fire Training Video
<SOLNBR>Reference-Number-464-07MR-1149
<RESPDATE>080207
<ARCHDATE>08172007
<CONTACT>ALEISHA  MOORE, PURCHASING AGENT, Phone 304-256-3215, Fax 304-256-3350, Email MOORE.ALEISHA@DOL.GOV
<DESC>MSHA IS SEEKING SOURCES FOR THE FOLLOWING:
Background:

While filling an SCBA oxygen tank for mine rescue training, a large, extremely hot fire erupted at an oxygen pump severely burning the Benchman.  The root cause of the fire was inadequate training of mine personnel in the setup, maintenance, and operation of the SCBA filling system.  Provisions of the new Miner Act that require more mine rescue teams and additional mine rescue training will increase the use of SCBA?s and the likelihood of another oxygen fire and injury.  To stay ahead of this risk, a training video will be developed to cover oxygen fire hazards and the precautions needed to help ensure the safe refilling of SCBA?s using oxygen booster pumps.


Final Product:

A training video, in DVD format, shall be prepared.  The video shall deal with the fire hazards of filling SCBA?s using an oxygen booster pump.  The video shall cover the entire SCBA filling process, including but not limited to, installation/construction of the refilling facility, receipt of oxygen supply bottles, maintenance of equipment, and training of personnel.  The video will be prepared for an audience of mining personnel that have received some prior training in the filling of SCBA?s. 

Deliverables:

The contractor will prepare a draft script and suggest various video footage/graphics required.  The contractor will coordinate with MSHA in determining the overall presentation concepts.  The contractor should rely on MSHA for administrative functions in order to control contract costs.  

MSHA will coordinate input and review of the script by MSHA and industry personnel (mine operators, mine rescue team benchmen, booster pump manufacturers, O2 suppliers, and others as necessary).   

Upon approval of the script by MSHA the contractor will assist MSHA in defining the video storyboard.  The contractor will help define the shots required and shoot and edit the video as required.  The contractor will also provide video graphics as necessary.  Filming of the process and especially actual oxygen fires at the contractor?s test facility will be conducted as necessary.  The contractor will provide necessary test facility personnel. 

The contractor will coordinate with MSHA and oxygen booster pump manufacturers (Haskel, Drager, Masterline, etc.) to include in the video as many different pumps and their manufacturer?s recommended safety procedures as practicable.  The contractor will also coordinate with MSHA and oxygen suppliers to include their safety recommendations.   

As necessary, copy-right permission for the video must be granted to MSHA at no additional charge.

Video production and distribution will be MSHA?s responsibility.

The contractor will assist MSHA in preparation of a hard copy format of the training.  This document will include the final script, revised as necessary for hard copy presentation, and additional information not included in the video.  This additional information may include full copies of oxygen booster pump manufacturer?s safety literature, oxygen supplier recommended safety practices, industry best practices, applicable industry safety standards, more detailed safety information, and, as necessary, documentation of references for statements in the video. 


Travel:

No travel expenses by vendor personnel are included in this purchase order.  MSHA or industry personnel may arrange mutually agreeable visits to the vendor?s facilities as necessary.


Service Rates:

The vendor will bill MSHA on an actual cost basis but shall not exceed the maximum amount specified in the purchase order.  The vendor should exercise prudent judgment in the choice of personnel working on the project.  Lower service rates should be charged where practicable to still achieve a quality product.


Safety and Health:

MSHA is dedicated to safety and health.  

It is of utmost importance that the training video depict safety and health procedures based on sound engineering, best industry practices, and OSHA and MSHA regulations and recommendations.  Where appropriate, concepts from ANSI Z10, Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems, should be incorporated into the training.  

The contractor is encouraged to suggest new or innovative safety and health concepts.  These must be clearly identified as such and accepted by MSHA prior to inclusion into the script.

All filming, especially of any staged fires, conducted at the contractor?s facility must be thoroughly planned.  The contractor must perform a risk assessment to identify hazards and necessary precautions.  All work must meet OSHA regulations.  Additional precautions may be necessary.  

POC IS ALEISHA MOORE AT MOORE.ALEISHA@DOL.GOV OR FAX TO 304-256-3350. NO PHONE CALLS ACCEPTED. QUESTIONS ARE DUE BY 7/27/2007.

The following questions were posted:

What is your time frame in regard to both the awarding of bid and for the production itself?
The time frame for the awarding of the bid will depend on how many quotes are received and the evaluation process. This may take at least a week. We anticipate the production will take about 8 weeks

Can you please tell me if you are looking for a contractor who will do all the things needed for completing a video, including the actual video taping and editing, music, etc. or just a contractor who will help produce it without supplying production services? MSHA is seeking a vendor with expertise in oxygen safety to assist in producing the script.  MSHA personnel will perform most of the video production.
 
What do you mean when you indicate that travel is not included?  Does this mean that only local vendors may bid?  To reduce costs, MSHA does not anticipate any travel by the vendor.  MSHA will coordinate with the vendor the shooting of scenes away from the vendor?s facilities.  MSHA and other parties may arrange mutually agreeable visits to the vendor?s facilities. 

Where do we need to be registered in order to bid on this project? You do not have to be registered in order to provide a quote. In order for MSHA to process a purchase order you would have to be registered in the Central Contracting Registration (CCR) www.ccr.gov.
 
 What is the process for bidding? To bid, please submit a quote via e-mail or fax to the fax number provided and after the closing date, the quotes will be evaluated.
 
1. What is the estimated running time (in minutes) of the proposed training video? 2. Will Government-provided subject matter expert(s) (SME[s]) oversee the writing of the video script and be present during the video production? 3. Will the Government provide non-speaking on-camera personnel (i.e. a Benchman, miners, et cetera) to appear in the video? 4. Will the Government supply the Contractor with specialized "props" to be used during the production (i.e. SCBAs, oxygen booster pumps, personal safety equipment, uniforms, et cetera)? If the Government indeed intends to supply these props, will the Contractor be permitted to use them during an actual oxygen fire?  
5. Will the Government require the Contractor to conduct on-camera interviews for the video? If so, how many interviews / statements will be required, who will appear in these interviews, and where and when will these interviews /statements occur? 6. Will the Government require the Contractor to record video in places where Benchmen, miners, and other people as required can be found working? If the Contractor is required to shoot in these places, will suitable electrical power (Alternating Current [AC]) be available for video lights and other equipment? The length of the video will be established based on the final script.  We do not anticipate the video will exceed 45 minutes.

MSHA personnel will oversee the writing of the script and be present during production.

MSHA will have personnel available to appear in the video but will also require vendor trained facility personnel to perform demonstrations as necessary.

MSHA has an oxygen pump and facilities at the National Mine Academy in Beaver, WV that can be used in the video.  However, the vendor is to supply all items for personnel.

Any interviews and the location of the interviews will be determined during preparation of the script.  No information on interviews is known at this time.

MSHA anticipates that most of the video production will be performed by MSHA personnel.  The locations will be determined during development of the script.

Length of video?

What administrative functions will MSHA provide?

How many different pumps and their manufacturer's recommended safety procedures will be shot?

Has the government requested a similar type of video?
 
Is the government?s decision on the contractor only based on cost?
 
How many days of shooting does the government anticipate for this job?
 
Will all the shooting be in 1 location?
 
If not please state where the locations are?
 
In the services sought it says the contractor will provide necessary test facility personnel. Please clarify.

The length of the video will be established based on the final script.  We do not anticipate the video will exceed 45 minutes.
 
MSHA will provide administrative functions such as typing, proof reading, printing, setting up meetings, and collecting and distributing documents.  MSHA also anticipates that MSHA personnel will shoot most of the video.
 
The number of different pump manufacturer?s pumps that will be included will be determined in the final script.  We anticipate three will be included.
 
We are aware of a similar video on oxygen regulator fires by the FDA.  See:   http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ocer/dcm/html/gallery.html 
 
The choice of vendor will primarily be based on the vendor?s knowledge of oxygen safety.
 
The number of days of shooting will be determined during development of the script and during actual production.  No estimate is available.  MSHA anticipates that MSHA personnel will shoot most of the video.
 
The shooting will likely take place at the vendor?s facility, MSHA?s National Mine Academy in Beaver, WV, and at a mine site to be determined.  Additional locations may be added.
 
MSHA anticipates that the successful vendor will be able to provide a facility and trained personnel to demonstrate best safety practices when using oxygen and stage fires, as necessary.
 
Does the MINE SAFETY & HEALTH ADMINISTRATION NATIONAL MINE SAFETY & HEALTH ACADEMY have a preferred vendor who has or has access to a ?test facility? where ?actual oxygen fires? could be conducted as necessary?? MSHA's intention is that prospective vendors have specialized knowledge of oxygen safety.  The vendor must be able to provide a facility with trained personnel for best practice demonstrations and the staging of fires, as necessary

Does this have to be shot at a specific location?
Do you have locations lined up (mines or manufactures) to shoot at?
I noticed that there is no money for travel costs.  Is this correct?
If there is no money for travel costs does it make sense for a company in California to bid on this project?
Do you have a budget range for the final product?  This is very helpful as it gives a sense of what you are looking for in terms of creative and quality.  This is something other government clients have done in the past.
How long to you think the final product will be?
Also ? do you have a treatment or detailed synopsis of the final product?  It is very difficult to create a budget without this as the creative drives the costs.  Is it a 5 day shoots or a 10 day shoots ? are there 10 extras or 50 extras, etc.
Do you want us to send in DVD samples of work
 Specific shooting locations will be determined during preparation of the script.  However, MSHA anticipates that a significant portion of the shooting will take place at MSHA?s National Mine Academy in Beaver, WV with additional shots at the vendor?s facility and at mining operations.
 
Several pump manufacturers have been contacted and they have expressed an interest in supplying pumps for shooting but MSHA has not discussed any shooting at their locations.  One mine in Alabama may participate.
 
To control costs, MSHA does not anticipate any travel by the vendor.  MSHA, and others as agreed to, will travel to the vendor?s facilities.  MSHA anticipates that MSHA personnel will coordinate shooting at other locations with the vendor.
 
MSHA is primarily seeking vendors with expertise in oxygen safety.  MSHA personnel will perform most of the video production work and associated travel.  Location of the vendor?s facilities should not negatively impact the contract.
 
We can not provide vendors with the budgetrange
 
The length of the video will be determined during preparation of the script.  MSHA anticipates the video will not exceed 45 minutes.
 
No detailed description of the video has been prepared.  A general outline follows.  The final product will be determined during preparation of the script.  
 
?                    The O2 booster pumps are very common.  This video may have a wide audience.
?                    People are not aware of the intensity and violence of an O2 fire.  Footage of an O2 fire video may be a good opening scene.
?                    The video should cover step-by-step instructions for the SCBA bottle refilling process.  Receipt of the O2 supply cylinder, cracking the valves, inspection of the system, connections, filters, and other system components should be covered.  
?                    The FDA has a oxygen regulator fire video available that may give us some ideas.   http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ocer/dcm/html/gallery.html# 
?                    Three ignitions mechanisms should be covered- particle impact, adiabatic compression, and contamination.
?                    There are lots of good practices that can be presented.
?                    We can use a format where a narrator or trainer is discussing the hazards with mine personnel.
?                    We?ll need shots of all of the components.
?                    We?ll need fire and aftermath footage.
?                    We should reference CGA, NFPA, OSHA, and MSHA (hazard communication) regs.
?                    Footage of a recreation a fire would help show the nature of the fire.
?                    MSHA mine rescue personnel will be asked to provide input for the video.
?                    The need to maintain O2 pumps per their operator?s manuals over the life of the equipment needs to emphasized. 
?                    The O2 pump involved in the fire was in use for a long time without incident and O2 fires have a very low probability.  We don?t want the video to exaggerate the hazard or scare people who need to work with oxygen.  We want mine personnel to know the hazards but also understand that the hazards can be managed.
 
Sample work is not required for consideration but will be accepted. 

The place of performance is in Triadelphia, WV not Beaver, WV

Response date has been extended to August 9, 2007. Please forward all questions by August 6, 2007.

Solicitation is set aside for small business only.

<DESC>We have attached the slide presentation and the questions and answers form the pre-bidders conference held 25 July 07.  In addition, there was one area that needs to be highlighted.  There are two optical requirements that will be assessed during the  Bid Sample Assessment.  One is the ability to look into the window of a vehicle with a requirement of 2  10 meters.  The second is the ability to look under a vehicle undercarriage with a requirement of 0  10 meters.   Also there was a schedule change resulting from the conference.  The bid sample assessment will now be moved from 20  23 August 07, to 13-15 August 07.  This is due to the RS JPO having a change of charter during the week of the 20th.   I have updated the schedule in the attachments on our local server so please revisit the site to download all of the most current documents.

<DESC>This notice herein provides the industry questions/comments, with corresponding government responses, in regards to the DRAFT PWS for non-personal information technology services for classified, unclassified and coalition systems for elements of the United States Army Network Enterprise Technology Command/9th Signal Command (Army ) (NETCOM/9th SC(A)), 5th Signal Command/U.S. Army Europe  Theater Network Operations Security Center (E-TNOSC) mission and its supported customers 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, including federal holidays.   Industry questions/comments, as submitted, were compiled into a list and are herein posted with their direct response.  INCUMBENCY NOTICE:  The requirements, as listed in this draft PWS, are NOT currently being perfo rmed by an incumbent contractor.  There are some services currently being performed at the E-TNOSC, but nothing that measures up to the magnitude as listed in this draft PWS.  The acquisition strategy for this new requirement is in no way similar to how E- TNOSC services were acquired in the past.  The Government feels there would be no value added to industry to review the minimal contracts in place as those contracts do not accurately depict this new requirement.  However, if industry desires to request th is information under FOIA, Ms. Connie Avallone at the 5th Signal Command may be contacted so as to provide the information for the Administrative Contracting Officer of the following contracts:  DADW35-01-A-0008, DADW35-01-A-0009, GS-35F-515H and DCA200-02 -D-5010.  Her email is connie.avallone@eur.army.mil.   The question/comment period for the E-TNOSC DRAFT PWS has now concluded.  THERE IS NO SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  REQUESTS FOR A SOLICITATION WILL NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.  Because the ASFI on ly allows file uploads to solicitation postings, please go to the following web link to access the Industry questions/comments in regard to the DRAFT PWS:  http://www.huachuca.army.mil/DOC/ITEC4-W/index.HTM and click on Whats Hot/New.

<DESC>21Contracting Squadron, Peterson AFB, CO intends to award a single source contract to Raytheon Technical Services Company.  USNORTCOM (NC) requires a currently existing aerial platform with multi-sensor capability available for immediate use.

NC is tasked to provide situational awareness, operations management, training and exercise support; damage assessments to a wide range of users within the Department of Defense (DoD); Defense Support to Civil Authorities (DSCA) at federal civilian agencies and state/local governments; and execute Homeland Defense (HD) missions. This includes requirements, events, and situations requiring immediate and wide ranging information available through real-time aerial Full Motion Video (FMV) imagery and other sensors.

This mission requires an aerial platform capable of a minimum operational speed of 200 knots, a minimum transit airspeed of 400 knots, and an unrefueled range greater than 700 miles. The aerial platform must be able to carry and operate more than a single sensor to ensure prompt and accurate Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) requirements are met. The aerial platform must arrive at the designated operations area or base within 24 hours of notification. The platform must be able to deliver unclassified live video coverage viewable with standard PC software from anywhere in the continental United States (CONUS), and provide up to 5 hours of video support per sortie with tasked coverage. Although resolution of imagery will be mission specific, the sensor must have the ability to conduct wide area collection and be able to sense objects to a half meter (0.5m) ground sample distance. The platform must have the ability to send this information to a DOD-identified and approved ground site in real-time. Further, the aerial platform must be able to employ a radar with maximum of 1 (one) meter resolution for wide area search, a maximum .4 meters narrow search resolution, and maximum Ground Moving Target Indicator of 10 (ten) meters.

The aerial FMV platform must have the capability to send imagery and imagery derived information back to HQ USNORTHCOM via government supplied and operated ROVER III receiver (minimum 45 nautical mile reception range) or Tactical Common Data Link ground station (minimum 75 nautical mile reception range) and provide the capability to simultaneously view video and corresponding standardized geographical mapping information indicating locations of video taken. Data and products must be compatible with the established NC communications infrastructure as described by the USNORTHCOM Joint Intelligence Operations Center ? North, Incident Awareness and Assessment/Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Concept of Operations.

All mission support to include Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), aircraft towing support, associated with the performance of this task will be provided by the contractor unless otherwise coordinated with NC for forward deployed operations. The platform must have a mission capable rate greater than 90 percent and be certified to operate in the National Airspace System (NAS).

The aerial platform with multi-sensor capability must currently exist and be available and able to support FMV missions prior to the issuance of a contract.

21 Contracting Squadron is seeking any offerors possessing this capability.  Anyone interested in this requirement is requested to respond to this synopsis.  

The response must include an overview of your company and capability, verification that you would possess this capability upon contract award, relevant past performance citations and point of contact information.

Please electronically submit a response to this synopsis by 1400MT, Monday the 13th of August 2007.  The responses should be submitted to Ms. Carla Johnson at Carla.johnson@peterson.af.mil and Ms. Teresa Lee at teresa.lee@peterson.af.mil.

Serious Games Initiative for Transportation Security Officer Training

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.  Additionally, the Government WILL NOT provide reimbursement for any information that may be submitted in response to this RFI.  Responses to this notice are not considered offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  The results of this RFI will be used in the development of the final Request for Proposal, and will be used in narrowing the field of potential offerors to which the final RFP will be sent.

This is a Request for Information (RFI) on a Serious Games Initiative for the Transportation Security Administration to introduce a new, innovative training style for training Transportation Security Officers (TSOs).  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) plays a critical role in safeguarding our nations transportation infrastructure in general and the security of the flying public in particular.  Poorly performed screener functions can have far reaching catastrophic results.  Therefore, it is essential to meet the challenge of maintaining the Transportation Security Officer (TSO) workforce at peak operational readiness, amidst rapidly changing circumstances. To that end, TSO training must be continual and ongoing, and therefore engaging to keep the learning community motivated.  

The Operational and Technical Training Group within TSA is introducing a new, innovative training style at TSA to enhance and transform its portfolio of TSO Training methodologies. This will include a Serious Games approach that can be a valuable tool to motivate the screener community to learn and perform at optimal levels.  The objective of this approach/initiative is to analyze, design, prototype, produce, deliver, and sustain a Serious Games training curriculum to satisfy the training needs and performance requirements of TSOs at TSA.  The TSO serious game initiative should meet the following high level objectives:  

sound pedagogy; 
leverage (where possible) commercial and TSA developed products; and
present realistic challenges and scenarios.

The purpose of this RFI is to: (1) gather ideas as to whether the attached draft Statement of Objectives (SOO) encompasses all aspects needed to design, produce, and deliver a serious game for training of TSOs; (2) identify potential bidders based on the submitted capability statements; and (3) finalize the acquisition strategy for the serious game initiative.

Responses to this RFI shall include:
 
Company name, address, point of contact, telephone/fax number, and email address;
Indication of business size status (such as disadvantaged, 8(a), HUB Zone, Woman Owned, Minority Owned, and/or Veteran Owned);
A capability statement (including number of years providing representative serious gaming methodologies); 
Comments on the draft SOO and approach; 
High level ROM estimate to complete Tasks 4.1.1 through 4.1.3 in the SOO; and 
a suggested timeline and milestones for the effort.  

Submissions are restricted to no more than ten (10) pages in length.

Offerors in their capability statement should describe at a minimum their expertise and experience in developing and implementing serious gaming techniques.  

All information in response to this RFI shall be submitted no later than 5 P.M. Eastern Standard Time, May 7, 2007 to the following email addresses: 

Deldridge.berry@associates.dhs.gov and
Sandra.mclaughlin@dhs.gov

Please note that the collection of this data does not obligate the Government to the incorporation of the solicited comments nor does it obligate the Government to the procurement of the services.  TSA thanks all respondents for their comments and inputs.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.     THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED FROM THIS SOURCES SOUGHT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS AN 8(a) SET-ASIDE; 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE OR AS FULL AND OPEN. ALL SIZE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541710 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 EMPLOYEES.     

The Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), National Institutes of Health (NIH) supports research to understand, and ultimately prevent and/or treat, infectious and immune-mediated diseases that continue to threaten millions of lives each year.  The Government is currently considering a competition for this effort which could result in one (1) award for a period of five (5) years.  

The objective of a contract if awarded would be to advance the field of clinical management for uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) by determining the optimal outpatient treatment strategy. 
In order to accomplish this objective a Contractor must be able to provide the scientific, technical, and managerial infrastructure, facilities, and other resources required to design and conduct a multi-site Phase II/III clinical trial. In addition, the Contractor must have the ability to determine the efficacy of off-patent oral antimicrobials and /or wound care for the treatment of outpatients with uncomplicated community-acquired skin and soft tissue infection in areas in the U.S, where the prevalence of CA-MRSA is high. An uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infection is defined as the presence of wound infection, abscesses, folliculitis, cellulitis or erysipelas.  Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections are defined as the isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from the relevant disease process from subjects who have not been hospitalized within the previous fourteen (14) days.  

In order to preserve the efficacy of vancomycin and linezolid, evaluation of these two antimicrobials would not be supported under this effort. In addition, clinical trials of invasive diseases (e.g., bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomylitis or pneumonia) or clinical trials with hospitalized patients would not be supported under this contract. 

Clinical trials under this effort would require a minimum of two (2) and a maximum of five (5) clinical trial sites. Each clinical trial site, included would also be required to have access to one hundred and twenty (120) subjects with skin and soft tissue infection every three (3) months to ensure enrollment of a minimum of forty (40) subjects every three (3) months.

Information submitted in your capability statement shall be pertinent and specific in the technical area under consideration in each of the following qualifications:   (1) facilities and expertise necessary for conducting multi-site Phase II/III clinical trials; (2) managerial infrastructure available for conducting multi-site Phase II/III clinical trials; (3) minimum of 2 Clinical sites; and (4) access to required number of subjects. Small business and 8(a) contractors are reminded that in order to qualify as a set-aside, 51% of the direct labor must be performed by the prime contractor.   It is estimated that a total effort of approximately   9.5 FTEs per year will be needed to accomplish this project.   Interested organizations are encouraged to respond and are required to submit two (2) copies of their capability statement addressing the areas cited above.     Please reference the solicitation number on all related correspondence and identify the NAICS and size status of your organization.     See Government-Wide Numbered Note 22.    NO COLLECT CALLS WILL BE ACCEPTED.     FACSIMILE AND E-MAIL TRANSMISSIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

<DESC>SUPPLIES SOURCES SOUGHT: The Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD) proposes to acquire services for the National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA to conduct studies to document the prevalence of fish with abnormalities in the St. Lucie estuarine system.  The studies will also be to evaluate potential factors detrimentally affecting the health of St. Lucie fish.  NOAA Fisheries Service has been sampling fish in the St. Lucie system since November 1996 to quantify the prevalence of fish with abnormalities, examine sources of variation and explore potential causal factors.  As part of the study, various factors are being evaluated for their effect on abnormality prevalence.  The work shall include obtaining laboratory studies (exposure trials) with small fish at the Ecotoxicology Laboratory of Florida International University (FIU).  The third year of experiments at the FIU Ecotoxicology Laboratory will focus on determining effects on fish of copper ?spiked sediments and Microystis aeruginosa.   This is a follow-on to work conducted in the previous year.  Fish fry will be exposed to (a) sediments spiked with copper, a major contamination the St. Lucie system and (b) toxins produced by Microcystis aeruginosa, which blooms in Lake Okeechobee and Upper St. Lucie system.  The purpose of the experiments is to explore potential cause-effect relationships between local sources of toxicity (i.e., contaminants such as copper and toxic algae and abnormalities in young fish).  The principal objective of the overall study is to develop a scientific basis for the use of prevalence of abnormal fish as a biological performance measure.  Trials in a controlled laboratory setting will be used to explore possible connections between biological indicators or effects and St. Lucie sediments or substances known to be present in St. Lucie sediments or waters.  NAICS code applicable to this requirement is 561990 or 6.5 million.   The proposed action is for services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.  If no qualified responses are received, the Government intends to contract with Florida International University, 11200 SW 8th Street, Miami, FL  33199.  This is not intended to be a competitive proposal.  However, interested parties may identify their interest and capabilities by submitting a required qualifications statement.  In order to be considered, firms must furnish detailed product data that demonstrates their capability to provide the services that will satisfy the Government?s needs.  All proposals received within fifteen (15) days after the date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Reference No. WC133W-07-RP-0175PY.  The Central Region Acquisition Division (CRAD), requires that all contractors doing business with this Acquisition Office must be registered with the Central Contractor Registry (CCR).  NO award can be made unless the vender is registered in CCR.  For additional information and to register in CCR please access the following web site: http://www.ccr.gov/.  In order to register with the CCR and to be eligible to receive an award from this acquisition office, all bidders must have a Dun & Bradstreet Number. A Dun & Bradstreet number may be acquired free of charge by contacting Dun & Bradstreet on-line at https://www.dnb.com/product/eupdate/requestOptions.html or by phone at (800) 333-0505.  In addition, completion of the online representation and certifications application (ORCA) is required.

<DESC>The National Children?s Study (NCS) is a major longitudinal cohort study that will follow children from before birth to at least 21 years of age and will evaluate the effects of a variety of environmental factors, including chemical, physical, biological, and psychosocial factors, on children?s health and well-being.  Researchers will analyze how these elements interact with each other and what helpful and/or harmful effects they might have on children?s health.  Data will be collected from children and their families from different areas of the country, from varied backgrounds, and of different family types.  

In order to study the main hypotheses for the National Children?s Study, a variety of data will be collected from participants, including biological specimens.  Biospecimens from a potential mother, father, and/or child will either be collected by a data collector or self collected by the participant and will take place at defined time periods or visits during the study. The visits are defined as Pre-Pregnancy (P1), First Trimester Pregnancy (T1), Third Trimester Pregnancy (T3), Birth (B) and 1, 3, 6, or 12 months after the child is born (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 12 Months).  Study centers from across the nation will manage the data collection within their area and will work with the Program Office (National Institute of Child Health and Development (NICHD), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Centers for Disease Control (CDC)) and the Coordinating Center (Westat) to meet the needs of the study.  The study will begin with 7 Vanguard Centers but will add on study centers over the first 11 years of the study to reach approximately 105 study locations.  In order to guarantee consistency of data collection across the study locations and between participants, the study plans to make use of pre-made biospecimen collection kits.  This will help streamline biospecimen collection and ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and good quality control in the field.  Biospecimen collection is an important part of this study and will require meticulous attention to detail as well as continuous efforts by the vendor to ensure that specific protocols for biospecimen kit production are followed.  The contents of each kit will require close attention to specific component labeling, tracking, and shipping as described in the following sections.

<SUBJECT>--NOTICE OF INTENT TO SOLE SOURCE
<DESC>USACE, Engineering Research & Development Center Contracting Office proposes to issue a sole source award to Dynatest Consulting, Inc., 165 South Chestnut Street, Ventura, CA  93001-2808. The purpose of the award is for the vendor to provide the curr ent military airfield and pavement program (PCASE) with a Model 8081 Heavy Weight Deflectometer and Support System.  This requirement also includes a folding hinge trailer for overseas shipping.   In 1986 the Army, Air Force, Navy and Federal Aviation Administration funded a study to determine applicability of various nondestructive testing equipment and analytical methods for the structural evaluation of airfield pavements.  The Dynatest equipment was selected based on accuracy, durability and reliability.   The current program (PCASE) for pavement analysis, design and evaluation has been developed over the past 20 years while using the response data collected from a Dynatest device.  The Government has gained much confidence in the current evaluation method a nd procedure, which predicts the load carrying capacity of airfield pavements in terms of mission aircraft utilizing data from a Dynatest nondestructive test device.  Although other nondestructive test devices may be available, the costs associated with ev aluating the performance of other systems would be enormous, and would also include unpredictable modifications to the PCASE program.   A firm-fixed price award will be made utilizing the Simplified Acquisition Procedures.  Any other responsible source able to provide the supplies is encouraged to respond to this announcement within 3 days after its publication. This is not a request for q uotations and there is no solicitation available at this time.

<SUBJECT>58 -- Sole Source - Harris Corp
<DESC>SOLE SOURCE NOTICE: The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 13.106.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals.  A copy of the requested items list will be given upon vendor request. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals.  However, all proposals received by 0800 EDT Wednesday 10 Aug 07, will be considered by the Government.  A determination not to compete with this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  Sole Source is based upon this vendor being the only manufacturer/vendor able to satisfy this requirement: Sole Source is also based upon the authority FAR 6.302-1(2)(C)(ii) which allows for sole source purchase if it is considered a follow-on contract for the continued development of a system when the award would result in duplication of cost.  The circumstances that justify the restrictions to a Harris-only acquisition are that the radios JTF Paladin currently has on-hand for SATCOM use are the Harris built AN/PRC-117F(C) multi-band radio.  The purchase of the Power Converter, Speaker, Gimbal Mount, KDU Extension Cable, and Satcom on the Move Antenna from Harris Corporation ensures compatibility of Harris radios currently in JTF Paladin?s current inventory and allows for interchangeability of other AN/PRC-117F(C) radios should one radio malfunction.  Harris Corporation maintains technical support in theater on Bagram Airfield at the Mantech Maintenance Facility.  The close proximity and availability of their maintenance technician makes Harris capable of providing the technical support and replacement support of the required equipment.  This includes assistance with installation of the communications equipment inside the up armored SUV.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS.  It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  
The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).  Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external form.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.  Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).  Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below: Commandant (G-CPM-S/3), 2100 2nd Street, SW, Room 2606, Washington D.C. 20593 Telephone (202) 267-2285 Fax: (202) 267-4011.

<DESC>THIS IS A COMBINED SYNOPSIS/SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL
ITEMS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORMAT IN THE FEDERAL ACQUISTION REGULATION (FAR) SUBPART 12.6-STREAMLINED PROCEDURES FOR EVALUATION AND SOLICITATION FOR COMMERCIAL ITEMS-AS SUPPLEMENTED WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS NOTICE.  THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONSTITUTES THE ONLY SOLICITATION; QUOTATIONS ARE BEING REQUESTED, AND A WRITTEN SOLICITATION DOCUMENT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.   THIS SOLICITATION IS BEING ISSUED USING SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITION PROCEDURES UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF  FAR SUBPART 13.5 TEST PROGRAM FOR CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ITEMS.  

This solicitation is a Request for Quotation (RFQ).  The solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 2005-18.

The associated North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code for this procurement is 334516 with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  

This requirement is being procured using full and open competition.  All responsible quoters may submit a quotation.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for one (1) each, Laser Tracker/Coordinate Measuring Machine System to be used in the Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) at NIST, Gaithersburg, MD. 

The NCNR designs, builds, operates and maintains a suite of cold and thermal neutron scattering instrumentation used in the conduct of material structure research.  The instruments which employ cold neutrons for research have the neutrons directed to them via mirrored guides.  The alignment of these guides to one another is critical to achieve the optimum transmission of neutrons.  

The alignment of the guides is impacted by several factors, which include installation accuracy and support stability.  The NCNR is under a new expansion directive that will include the construction of a new Guide Hall.  This Guide Hall will house at least four (4) instrument guides.  The Laser Tracker/Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) will be used to align these guides during installation and monitor any shift in position due to floor settling in the future.  The accuracy of the Laser Tracker/Coordinate Measuring Machine will be key to providing the best possible transmission of neutrons through the guides.

All responsible quoters shall provide a quote for the following line items:  

LINE ITEM 0001:  Quantity one (1) each, Laser Tracker/Coordinate Measuring Machine System.  The system shall meet or exceed all of the following required specifications:

1. System must have a measurement range of at least 125 feet (38 meters);

2.  System must have a horizontal measurement range of plus or minus 180 degrees;

3. System must have a vertical measurement range of plus or minus 45 degrees;

4. System must have an operational temperature range of 20 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 6 to 38 degrees Celsius);

5. System must have Absolute Distance Meter (ADM) precision, hereafter referred to as accuracy, of 0.001 inches (25 microns) within 50 feet (15.25 meters).  Preference shall be given to systems which have an accuracy of 0.001 inches over a longer range, not-to-exceed 200 feet and/or accuracy better than 0.001 inches over the 50 foot range;
			
6. System must be portable.  NIST intends to move the system from guide to guide during testing.  Therefore, a system that is required to be bolted or otherwise fixed to the floor, walls, etc., shall not be acceptable;

7. System must have Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) capabilities with 3-D Solid CAD Modeling reverse engineering output;

8. System must have CMM measurement range of at least 10 feet (3 meters).

LINE ITEM 0002: INSTALLATION:  The Contractor shall install the laser tracker system.  Installation shall include, at a minimum, uncrating/unpackaging of all equipment, set-up and hook-up of all equipment, start-up, and demonstration of all minimum specifications.  Any specific installation requirements must be discussed with the NIST Technical Contact (to be identified upon award) at least 2 weeks prior to shipment of the instrument from the factory.  

LINE ITEM 0003: TRAINING:  The Contractor shall provide training on-site at NIST Gaithersburg for six (6) NIST personnel.  This training may commence immediately upon completion of 
installation.

The Contractor shall pack and mark the shipment in conformance with carrier requirements, deliver the shipment in good order and condition to the point of delivery specified in the purchase order, be responsible for any loss of and/or damage to the goods occurring before receipt and acceptance of the shipment by the consignee at the delivery point specified in the purchase order; and pay all charges to the specified point of delivery.  The Contractor shall deliver all line items to NIST, Building 301, Shipping and Receiving, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

Upon completion of installation and demonstration of specifications, NIST shall conduct its own performance check in the NIST laboratory to verify adherence to all required specifications.  This performance check may be witnessed by the Contractor. 

EVALUATION CRITERIA AND BASIS FOR AWARD

(3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group.

(iv) convertible debt instruments; and
(v) others similar interests.

NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS

It is the policy of the Coast Guard to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner.  The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation.  OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the General Accounting Office (GAO).

Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the Coast Guard as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum.  Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.

Informal forum with the Ombudsman.  Interested parties who believe that a Coast Guard procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer.  If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests.  Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance.  Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum.  In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman:  solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). 

Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman.  Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions.  If the protester?s concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman.  The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.  Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government.  The agency?s goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing.  Protests shall include the information set forth at FAR 33.103(d)(2).  If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed.  This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e).  Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be forwarded to the address below:

                                                    Commandant (G-A)
