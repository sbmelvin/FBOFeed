<CONTACT>Sherri Glover Contracting Officer 3032313936     ;
<DESC>US Film and Video Productions (USF) is a fee for service, full broadcast quality production studio under the Minerals Management Service, Department of the Interior.   USF intends to acquire a performance based service contract for audiovisual services for 5 years (base year and four one-year options).  The USF facility is located on the Denver Federal Center, Lakewood, Colorado.  USF has been providing film, video, and new media materials to federal agencies for 10 years.  Currently there are four government personnel managing and overseeing the government owned/contractor operated (GOCO) facility with three contractor employees on site; a producer/director, an editor, and an audio technician.  This GOCO facility provides expert advice, oversight, coordination, quality control, and production management to federal agency clients while producing output such as documentaries, training, PSAs, satellite conferences, interactive kiosks and video walls for visitor centers, living histories, legislative updates, event announcements, media relations, marketing services, CD-ROM and DVD development, brochure/booklet design and production, website development, and outreach programs.  The successful offeror will be required to place a producer/director onsite who will serve as the main liaison between the contractor and the government and will attend various meetings with government and clients.  Offerors are encouraged to propose alternative scenarios to the existing staffing arrangement.  The USF facility is available for contractor use and has a variety of video production equipment as well as a fully functional studio with a video editing suite, an audio/sweetening suite, a production studio with full lighting grid, cyc curtain, producers viewing station and office space and computers for on-site personnel.    USF uses an AVID Adrenalin video editing system and a digital audio editing system (Digidesign Pro Tools).    The successful offeror will utilize the USF facilities and equipment as needed for individual projects but must also have the capacity to produce the types and ranges of programs stated above with their own resources.   Most shooting will occur in the United States, but could also take place overseas.  Frequent travel by onsite personnel, particularly the Producer/Director, is required.  HOW TO RESPOND:  If you are interested in competing for this requirement/contract, you must demonstrate that you are qualified to perform the work by providing a CAPABILITIES STATEMENT to the Contracting Officer NLT 2:00 PM Mountain Daylight Time on March 3, 2004.  Submit an original and four copies of the statement that is no more than 50 pages long and describe Past Performance, Proposed Staffing and Personnel Qualifications, and Offeror's Facilities.  In the PAST PERFORMANCE section, describe five projects completed in the last three years, including the scope, length, cost of project, and summary of the projects as well as the client names, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail addresses. Describe how/if the projects were completed on time, within budget, and within specifications.  Include a sample reel of projects (30 minutes max) on VHS. Sample reels will not be returned.  In the PERSONNEL QUALIFICATIONS segment, include resumes for each employee proposed for USF.  The OFFEROR'S FACILITY segment should consist of a description of the kinds of equipment, facilities and resources available to support the USF projects.  Brochures can be submitted but will be included in the 50-page restriction. The Government's evaluation of the Capabilities Statement will be based on the following:  1. Past Performance--the offeror's qualifications to operate the GOCO in a responsive, economical and efficient manner and the degree of past success established by the offeror's references.  2.  Personnel Qualifications--the quality of the experience, training, and education of each proposed employee to ensure that professional broadcast- quality video productions will be made at USF; the existence of communications skills, marketing skills, leadership, and the ability (especially for the Producer/Director) to adjust to diverse client profiles.  3.  Offeror's Facilities--ability of offeror to supply production and post production capabilities of multiple productions to USF simultaneously.  Upon completion of Capability Statement evaluations, the Government will advise each respondent that he will, or will not, be invited to participate in any resultant acquisition.  All respondents are hereby informed that, notwithstanding advice provided by the Government in response to their submissions, any respondent, at his request, may participate in the Request for Proposal (RFP).  Responses to the RFP will consist of oral technical presentations, including samples of productions, and written technical and price proposals.

<DESC>NASA/GRC has a requirement for eight(8) panels nominally 6 x 9 x 0.1" using 5 HS fabric (T300 and T300 commingled with SiC)provided by NASA/GRC.  Four panels shall be densified with CVI SiC, and four with Si3N4.  A pyrocarbon interphase shall be deposited prior to matrix infiltration. NASA/GRC intends to purchase the items from Hypertherm HTC Composites Inc. of Huntington Beach CA.  The statutory authority permitting other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirement.   The current effort would apply fabrication techniques developed with HyperTherm HTC under a prior contract to the processing of eight additional panels.  Because the CVI deposition is proprietary for each fabricator as to deposition temperatures, vapor species, flow rates, deposition rates, etc., mechanical properties and durability of C/SiC materials vary by fabricator.  GRC already has an extensive database in properties of these materials.  Robust statistical comparison of these new materials with those already characterized requires that we use the same vendor and the same CVI infiltration parameters.    Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to the identified point of contact not later than 4:30 p.m. local time on February 27, 2004.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice, is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.   An Ombudsman has been appointed.

<DESC>The applicable NAICS Code is 611430, $6 million. The Federal Highway Administration has a need to contract for the presentation of our existing 3-day Course #310108 – Federal Lands 101. Revisions to course materials may be required from time to time. The FHWA is responsible for ensuring the safety, efficiency, and economy of the Nation's highway transportation system. The FHWA oversees all phases of highway policy, planning, research, design, operations, construction, and maintenance. There are two principal programs that accomplish this vital task. 

The Federal Aid Highway Program offices, in cooperation with the State Departments of Transportation, administer the nation's comprehensive highway system. The Federal Lands Highway Program (FLHP), as an adjunct to the Federal-Aid Highway Program, covers highway programs in cooperation with Federal land managing agencies. It provides transportation-engineering services for planning, design, construction, and rehabilitation of the highways and bridges providing access to federally owned lands. The Federal Lands Highway organization also provides training, technology, deployment, engineering services, and products to other customers. 

The FHWA administers the Federal Lands Highway Program, including survey, design and construction of forest highway system roads, parkways and park roads, Indian reservation roads, defense access roads, and other Federal lands roads. 

The FHWA, through cooperative agreements with Federal land managing agencies such as the National Park Service, Forest Service, Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs, administers a coordinated Federal lands-program consisting of forest highways, public lands highways, park roads and parkways, refuge roads, and Indian reservation roads. This program provides funding for more than 90,000 miles of federally owned and public authority-owned roads that serve Federal lands. The Agency's Federal Lands Highway Office provides program coordination, administration and design, and construction engineering assistance and directs the conduct of transportation planning and engineering studies.

With the passage of the Transportation Equity Act (TEA-21), the program for Federal Lands Highway (FLH) nearly doubled and there is the prospect that it will again increase under pending transportation reauthorization. This coupled with the increasing demand by our partners and customers for more technical assistance and the smaller pool of college graduates from which to select, the FLH has been hiring more mid-career professionals. While their technical skills are excellent, their knowledge of the Federal Lands operation is generally minimal. 

To address these needs, the Federal Lands 101 FHWA (Course # 310108), was developed in 2003. The overall course objective was to develop a course that describes how FLH operates in order to (1) administer programs, (2) deliver projects, (3) develop and transfer technology and (4) provide external training. The targeted audience is new hires to the Federal Land Highway in all positions and grades, Federal-Aid employees and Federal Lands Management Agency employees upon request. The training includes a combination of instructional strategies such as lectures, videos, case studies, and group exercises/discussions. The case studies and exercises are transportation-related, highway-industry related and intermodal in scope.

The contractor must incorporate the latest accepted Instructional System Design (ISD) using adult learning techniques in the development of course materials and instruction. Normally, there will be a FLH instructor in attendance who works with the contractor instructor throughout the course to provide the Federal perspective and the latest policies and regulations that may impact the content of the course. However, the contractor shall provide skilled, competent, knowledgeable, credible, instructors with adult education experience capable of successfully teaching the course even without the assistance of a FLH instructor.

Extensive information on Federal Lands Highway can be accessed through the website http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/flh.

The solicitation and all related documents and amendments, if any, will only be released and available electronically through Federal Business Opportunities (FedBizOpps) web site at http://www1.eps.gov/spg/DOT/FHWA/postdate_1.html which will list all the FHWA business opportunities sorted by posted date. The solicitation and related documents will be posted under the RFP number. Interested parties must download the RFP from that site. NO WRITTEN, TELEPHONIC, FACSIMILE, OR E-MAIL REQUESTS will be honored. Since this solicitation will only be available electronically, it is the responsibility of interested parties to monitor the FebBizOpps website for any solicitation amendments. Interested parties can register at the FebBizOpps site to receive e-mail notifications of postings.

Please note that FedBizOpps has a feature called “Interested Vendors List.” Those interested in subcontracting, supplying, consulting, teaming and the like should register, and contractors may find it helpful to review the names posted there.

The ESTIMATED release date of the RFP is February 24, 2004. NO OTHER PROCUREMENT INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.

<SUBJECT>10 -- Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Airborne Selectable Fuze
<SOLNBR>FA8681-04-R-0172
<CONTACT>Sallye Belton, Contracting Officer, Phone 850 882-8113, Fax 850 882-2533, Email sallye.belton@eglin.af.mil - Steve Wall, Contract Specialist, Phone (850) 882-4967, ext. 5363, Fax (850) 882-1680, Email harold.wall@eglin.af.mil
<DESC>The Air Armament Center (AAC), Direct Attack Program Office, submits this presolicitation notice in preparation for award of a Sole Source contract to McDonnell Douglas Corporation, A Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Boeing Company, for the design and development of an airborne selectable fuze system (ASFS) for use with the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM).  The Government has identified specific requirements for a new fuze system intended to enhance the effectiveness of all JDAM variants.  The fuze shall be capable of selecting discreet detonation delay increments and shall consist of a locking ring, environmentally derived power source, and cable.  The selectable fuze system shall incorporate the following operational modes:  Power-on/Captive-Carry mode, Safe Jettison mode, Safe Separation mode,  Pre-arm mode, Arm mode, Impact, Delay after Impact, External Fire Command mode, and Delay after External Command mode.  The ASFS shall include arm-delay settings from 4 to 10 seconds in half-second increments and additional discreetly selectable delay settings of 14, 21 and 25 seconds.  Detonation delay selections shall include:  Instantaneous, 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 60, 90, 180 and 240 milliseconds.  The ASFS must be compatible with existing weapon fuze and aircraft cockpit interfaces.  The system must also be compatible with all JDAM weapon variants (GBU-31/Mk-84 and BLU-109, GBU-32/Mk-83 and BLU-110, and GBU-38/Mk-82 and BLU-111) and with height-of-burst sensors (DSU-33).  The fuze system must be designed to ensure a high degree of operational reliability within environmental conditions that encompass the full range of JDAM flight envelopes, including but not limited to High Altitude, Low Airspeed (HALA).  The ASFS design shall provide for serial data trainers, load crew trainers, and explosive ordnance disposal trainers.  The contractor shall employ an “arm consent” function within its design for fuze system integration with the JDAM tail-kits.  The contractor shall develop the arm consent algorithm and command for the JDAM as well as for implementation within the fuze.  This function will inhibit fuze arming until a consent signal is received from the tail-kit declaring that the weapon is near and will likely strike its intended target.  Should the JDAM guidance system indicate it will be unable to make adjustments necessary to ensure an accurate target impact, the arm consent signal shall be withheld and the fuze prevented from arming.  The system must maintain full functional capability for no less than an 11-minute JDAM time-of-flight and be able to withstand hard target penetration.  The service life of the system shall be 10 years.  The airborne selectable fuze system shall be compatible with the Common Munitions Built-in Test Reprogrammable Equipment (CMBRE) and Air Force mission planning systems.  The fuze system shall be fully capable of employment by Air Force aircraft operating worldwide in all-weather conditions.  This global mission further requires the ASFS to be capable of worldwide transportation on commercial and military trucks, railcars, aircraft, or ships.  The fuze system must be capable of prolonged storage under widely diverse conditions in the Continental United States and overseas.  In-field Government support requirements are limited to unpacking and repacking the airborne selectable fuze system, performing visual inspection, minor corrosion control, installing and removing the airborne selectable fuze system in warheads.  The ASFS shall comply with Department of Defense insensitive munitions requirements for fuzes.  The contractor shall also request and obtain approval for the design of the fuze system from the Air Force Non-nuclear Safety Board.  The contractor shall be responsible for the development, qualification, and performance of the total system, including the fuze, locking ring, power source, cable, and JDAM arm consent function.  The contractor shall conduct qualification testing to demonstrate fuze system functional reliability (95% with 90% confidence) under potential JDAM release environments identified by the Government.  The contractor shall provide 600 units for development, qualification, first article acceptance, and operational suitability testing, to be completed within 15 months after contract award.  The contractor shall demonstrate the capacity to deliver 1,000 initial production units within 3 months after completion of the development contract and 3,000 units per month thereafter.  The contractor shall establish a unit price cost curve based on these quantities.  The contractor shall provide a 20-year warranty on the fuze system storage life.  The technical data package for the JDAM tail kit is proprietary contractor information and is not available to interested sources. In the event this notification results in a contract action, the acquisition will utilize North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code, 332993.  For information concerning this synopsis, please contact Sallye Belton, Contracting Officer,  (850) 882-3525, extension 3070, e-mail: sallye.belton@eglin.af.mil.  For technical information, contact the Program Manager, Capt Brent Gagnard, (850) 882-3525, extension 3055, e-mail:  brent.gagnard@eglin.af.mil.

<DESC>Current Architecture: The current ALERT application is a n-tiered server architecture that operates on Proliant 8500 servers using the Windows 2000 operating system and Sybase database system software.  The application software is programmed using Delphi.  There are four main software components 
¨	The ALERT analysis software includes specific scans that target certain suspect patterns of fraudulent activity.  ALERT utilizes data from two sources; transaction data that is received from the states operation EBT systems, and retailer data that is extracted from present mainframe systems that house the FNS national retailer database for authorizing and monitoring participating Food Stamp retailers.
¨	A web site provides user information on existing releases, tutorials and a data mart known as AMART.  
¨	ESSRA is a component which provides retailer management data that has been extracted weekly from the FNS national retailer tracking database.  ESSRA is used in the field and regional offices to manage daily retailer authorization activities and allows users to download data into standard Excel spreadsheets or Access tables for further manipulation 
¨	Watchlist is a management reporting tool designed to systemically track identified suspect retailers and the status of activities by FNS staff regarding each identified retailer.  

FNS’ overall system environment is transitioning from mainframe to server and web-based technologies.  Current software standards require Section 508 compliance for all agency systems.  FNS is planning to migrate the present ALERT database system to SQL Server 2000 prior to the commencement of the new base contract.  Users are provided Windows 2000 and Office Suite products on their workstations or laptops installed with the ALERT application software.  Depending on access to the Department Wide Area Network, users connect via the WAN or utilize dial-in capabilities.  A limited number of users are able to access the ALERT system using Virtual Private Networks (VPN) for secured connections via the Internet, which we expect to grow in the next few years as the preferred method for remote access.  

Background: ALERT is a decision support management system built around the retailer management and compliance requirements of the Food Stamp Program.  The primary purpose is to load and analyze food stamp transactional data, e.g., food stamp purchases in any of 150,000 authorized food stamp retailer locations.  Data is submitted to FNS by State EBT processors each month.   Only a few States remain to be implemented, the largest being California.  Current data on the status of EBT State activities is available on the FNS website athttp://www.fns.usda.gov/fsp/ebt/.    At present, there are nearly 70 million transactions processed monthly and a rolling 6 months of data is maintained on-line.  When all states have implemented EBT, monthly transaction data is estimated to be about 85 million transactions.  Key elements of each electronic transaction are extracted by the EBT processors and provided to the ALERT system.  This data includes information such as dollar amount, location, terminal ID, date and time of the transaction, type of entry (card swiped through a reader or manually key–entered), and whether a paper voucher was issued.
This acquisition is for the maintenance and upkeep of the system, as well as possible enhancements that may arise.  The contract is full and open to all sources, will have a base period of one year with four (4) one (1) year option periods, and will be a combination of fixed price and IDIQ.  It is anticipated that the RFP will be issued on or about March 1, 2004.  Please, NO TELEPHONE INQUIRIES.

<DESC>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has a requirement for nine (9) semiconductor grade NFPA approved gas cabinets for containing toxic and pyrophoric gases for the future Advanced Measurement Laboratory Nanofabrication Facility.  NIST intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis with Matheson Tri-Gas, 166 Keystone Drive, Montgomeryville, PA  18936 under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b).  NIST currently has three (3) qualified Matheson Tri-Gas cabinets and purge systems which will be moved to the new facility.  Compatibility is required to allow the new gas cabinets and monitoring system to be interfaced directly with the existing cabinets and purge systems without modifications or adaptations.  Having identical cabinets will allow personnel to have one working infrastructure for gas containments and gas monitoring.  This is critical in providing a simple, understandable, and robust safety mechanism for the control and monitoring of dangerous and hazardous gases.

The proposed purchase will include the following line items and quantities: (1) 1CE200 x 1CE Source System for SiH4 (2 each), (2) 2CE Source Systems for SiH2C12, C12, NH3 (3 each), (3) 3CE Source System for SF6 and BC13 (1 each), (4) 3CE Source System for C4F8 and CHF3 (3 each), plus sensors, indicator units, system chassis, central alarm unit, power supply strobe stack, tubing, duct adaptors, and mounting brackets.

The Government anticipates the award of a firm-fixed price (FFP) purchase order on or about February 25, 2004. The proposed requirement is for supplies for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotations. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. A Request for Quotation (RFQ) package is not available.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, to negotiate on a sole source basis pursuant to FAR 6.302-1(a) and U.S.C. 253(c)(1) with Health Level Seven, Inc. a not-for-profit Michigan corporation at 3300 Washtenaw Avenue, Suite 227, Ann Arbor, MI 48104, for a three-year contract.  The contract will provide NLM with (1) data and services necessary to ensure Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) vocabularies as distributed through NLM's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus are usable with Health Level Seven (HL7). Examples of this work include designation of which parts of CHI standard vocabularies are valid for which parts of HL7 messages; recommendations for how best to represent these relationships properly in the UMLS; comparison of appropriate HL7 lists of coded values to CHI standard vocabularies to determine if some of them can be replaced by subsets of a CHI standard vocabulary; advice/assistance on various matters related to the use of UMLS vocabulary tools, documentation, and related materials in conjunction with the HL7 standard.  (2) creation of an easily implementable HL7 standard to identify the generic content of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) in a manner that facilitates integration with vocabulary standards as distributed through the UMLS and specifying how that content is sent in a way that it can be received, understood and used independent of the actual architecture and structure of the sending and receiving systems.  Examples of this work include analyzing the two current HL7 standard approaches to determine the functional gaps; studying related research efforts to determine what existing resources can be drawn upon to fill these gaps; drafting standards and testing them against reality in demonstration implementations; recommendations for the best means of representing and integrating this new HL7 standard in the UMLS.  

HL7 is an ANSI-accredited standards developing organization (SDO) that produces proprietary message format standards for clinical and administrative health data.  Like all ANSI-accredited SDOs, HL7 adheres to a strict and well-defined set of operating procedures that ensures consensus, openness and balance of interest. Members of HL7 are known collectively as the Working Group, which is organized into technical committees and special interest groups. The technical committees are directly responsible for the content of the Standards. Special interest groups serve as a test bed for exploring new areas that may need coverage in HL7's published standards.  HL7 is the only organization that can expand and enhance HL7 standards.

The National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics (NCVHS) in February 2002 recommended the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services adopt HL7 as a core Patient Medical Record Information (PMRI) message format standard.  The Consolidated Health Informatics Initiative endorsed this recommendation in the fall of 2002 by recommending the adoption of HL7 as the common messaging format standard to be used by federal health care facilitates for the exchange of health care information.  On March 21, 2003, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Defense, and Veterans Affairs announced HL7 as one of the first set of uniform standards to be adopted across the federal government for the electronic exchange of clinical health information.  In July 2003 the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to work with HL7 to design and ballot a standardized model of an electronic health record.  At the July 2003 National Health Information Infrastructure Conference the Standards and Vocabulary Track recommended expediting the alignment of HL7 models and messages with standard vocabularies as well as accelerated adoption of the NCVHS and CHI recommendations.  In its November 5, 2003 letter to the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, the NCVHS recommended adoption of a core set of PMRI Terminology Standards.  This letter further recommended coordination between the PMRI Message Format Standards (including HL7) and the PMRI Terminology Standards. In addition, HL7 is the proposed message standard for the Claims Attachment transaction of the Administration Simplification section of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  

While Health Level Seven, Inc.'s existing standards and guides are increasingly being recognized and recommended for implementation in the health care sector, these standards and guides need to be expanded and refined to work effectively with standard vocabularies.   Since HL7 standards and guides are proprietary products of Health Level Seven, Inc. any changes to them can only be achieved from within HL7 and by consensus of the organizations membership.  NLM has therefore determined that Health Level Seven, Inc. is the only source capable of providing these services.  However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  This notice of intent is not a Request for Proposals (RFP), nor is an RFP available.  See Numbered Notes 22 and 26.

<DESC>The General Services Administration, National Office of Realty Services, is responsible for the acquisition of leasehold interests and related real estate services for the Federal government.  It is seeking highly qualified commercial real estate firms to assist with the performance of national commercial brokerage services.  GSA anticipates awarding approximately four Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order type contracts each with a base year and four (4) one-year option periods. Evaluation of options for award does not obligate the Government to exercise the options.  The contracts require the capability to provide services for the entire United States and the U.S. Territories listed below under place of contract performance.  

GSA intends to conduct the acquisition following FAR Part 15, negotiated best value source selection procedures, and not FAR Part 12 Acquisition of Commercial Items.  One award will be set-aside for a qualified small business firm, team or joint-venture.

The Government is not responsible for payment for services performed by contractors under the contracts.  Contractors have the opportunity to collect the real estate commissions typically available in the commercial market place for services provided to the Government.

It is anticipated that the Request for Proposals (RFP) will be issued on or about March 5, 2004, with proposals being due in approximately 45 days.  The date for the pre-proposal conference will be included in the RFP.  GSA is issuing the solicitation only electronically.  Interested parties will be able to access the solicitation at http://www.FedBizOpps.gov.

<DESC>This modification removes the question marks (?) from the original posting of the Request for Information (RFI).  The RFI is hereby restated.  This Request For Information (RFI) solicits commercial industry input to support an update of the existing guidance contained in the Contractor Support in the Theater of Operations Deskbook Supplement, dated 28 March 2001.  This RFI does not constitute a Request For Proposal and the Government does not intend to make a contract award in conjunction with this RF I.  The current Deskbook Supplement is located at: http://akss.dau.mil/servlet/ActionController?screen=Policies&Process=3. Any industry comments received to this effort will be considered for potential inclusion in the updated Deskbook Supplement.  The U.S. has a long history of using contractors on the battlefield and our use is increasing as we continue to reduce DoD uniform ed & civilian force structure.  The legal basis for using contractors lies in Title 10 Section 129a, which authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use civilian contracting if it is beneficial to the government and consistent with military requirements.  The  Contractor Support in the Theater of Operations Deskbook Supplement was first promulgated on 28 March 2001.  The purpose of this document is to provide references and offer suggestions on generic contract terms and conditions that may be applicable for in clusion in contracts written to support contingency operations.  Update of this guidance is deemed beneficial to capture industry input on this subject, which may include lessons identified from recent operations.  The format for submissions is left to the  submitters discretion.  However, specific phrases, language, terms or conditions are desired to minimize the potential for misinterpretation.  General comments to this update effort may also influence overarching DoD policy.  However, it is not the intent ion of this RFI to respond to industry inquiries on existing policy.  Email is the preferred means of receipt.   Submissions in response to this RFI are expected to be unclassified.  Address for the Submission of Responses:  Responses sent via conventional  mail should be sent to the following address:  The Joint Staff; Attention:  LT G. D. Lyster, SC, USN; 4000 Joint Staff; Pentagon, Room 2C828; Washington, DC 20318-4000.  Responses sent via e-mail should be sent to the following e-mail address: lystergd@js .pentagon.mil.

<DESC>FMS has four primary objectives related to the payment systems modernization effort.  All objectives are of the same critical importance.  Developing a detailed, proven solution that achieves all four is a necessary pre-requisite for embarking on the projects.  The objectives include:
1) Modernization of underlying technologies  
The new payment solution must replace the legacy technologies in use today with newer, more flexible technologies.  In particular, FMS has decided to migrate away from flat files to a relational database.  Use of a relational database will enable a great deal more flexibility in storing, configuring, transmitting and reporting payments information to stakeholders and to other FMS business lines.  An acceptable solution must explain what underlying technologies (HW platform, OS, application language, COTS, and database) will be leveraged and why.  
2) Standardization and consolidation of the 30+payment systems
The core functionality delivered by the multiple payment systems is very similar and FMS believes it can capture significant cost savings by standardizing and consolidating the systems down to a few, standard but configurable functional modules.  An acceptable architectural solution must demonstrate how it can achieve this consolidation while allowing enough configurability to support the minor process differences between agencies.  
3) Incorporation of process improvements and automation opportunities
The legacy technologies currently employed have hampered FMS’ ability to streamline and automate a number of payments processing operations.  The attached requirements include a description of the functionality needed to achieve these efficiency goals.  An acceptable solution must address these requirements.  A superior solution will offer additional ideas on how to improve the payments process.  
4) Increased systems flexibility
While the payments process is fairly stable, regulatory and legislative changes do impact the process and can drive system changes.  FMS is looking for a solution that leverages modern configurable technologies such as databases, message brokers, data translation tools, reporting tools that will allow the organization to respond to new requirements in a quick and efficient manner.  In particular, it is looking for a solution that will minimize the need to make “hard code” changes when new requirements arise. 
Conclusion  
In order to accomplish these objectives, FMS believes it needs a solution with a very carefully detailed architecture.  A modular, configurable design is an absolute pre-requisite for building a system that can handle the full set of payment processing requirements while ensuring a highly manageable system.  Building such a manageable system will likely require standardized business logic combined with configurable technologies.  Finally, FMS has a strong bias towards solutions that leverage COTS components.  Ideally, the system architecture will consist of an integrated set of packaged SW applications with a minimum of customization and new development.

<DESC>The Government is seeking sources interested in producing Coupling Half, Quick Disconnects (CHQDs), NSN: 4730-01-391-8461, P/N: 5-1-1086.  The government intends to issue a Best Value solicitation for an estimated total quantity of 1.4M CHQDs. However, because these items are urgently needed the government intends to solicit with a very compressed delivery schedule. The government requires deliveries at a rate of appr oximately 175,000 to 350,000 per month. In order to meet the required monthly rate, the government may make more than one contract award. A First Article Test (FAT) is required 60 days after contract award. The government may consider waiving FAT for those  contractors that have previously produced this item. If FAT is waived deliveries will be required to commence 60 days after the contract is awarded.  If  FAT is required deliveries will commence 60 days after FAT have been approved. If your firm is intere sted and has the capacity to produce in a compressed schedule at a very high rate, immediately notify the point of contact in this notice by 3 Mar 04.  The CHQD is an assembly that is a part of the drink system for the M40 Series Protective Gas Mask.  The quick disconnect end of the CHQD interfaces with the M1 Canteen Cap allowing the user to drink water from a canteen when the plunger within the CHQD housing is actuated.  The other end of the CHQD attaches to an external rubber drink tube leading to the ma sk.  Within the aluminum housing of the CHQD is a spring, plunger, gasket and end fitting.  As part of this assembly, a curved (90 degree nominal) aluminum tube elbow connects to the end fitting within the housing.  The overall length of the CHQD assembly is approximately 2 1/8 inches consisting of the housing (approximately 1 1/2 inches long, .438 inch nominal diameter) and the bent aluminum tube.  The tube (3/16 approx. outside diameter) before bending measures approximately 1 1/4 inches in length.  Since  the CHQD is part of the mask system, this assembly must not leak when not in use for drinking.  To assure proper performance, leakage and air flow resistance testing is required of the assembly.  Technical POC: Glen Broman (309)782-4550 and Willie Felix/L ead Engineer (309)782-8024.

<CONTACT>Mary Hill, 309-782-6654
<DESC>The M70 Series Cable assemblies are the method used to transfer fuze power from the delivery aircraft to electronic bomb fuzes and target detecting devices to initiate the energetic explosive. Cables are identical except for length. The cable assembl y consists of 2 lengths of cordage, with a fuze plug on one end of each and a 1 1\2 inch plastic receptable that joins the other end of each. The fuze plug consists of contact rings and pin, then injection molded with silicone/thermoplastic rubber compound . The metal contacts are connected to the receptacle and then potted to prevent moisture intrusion and electrical failures.  The cable assembly is very difficult to produce to the exacting First Article and Lot Acceptance Test parameters. Any potential producer must have a highly trained, experienced workforce whom possesses the critical, specialized skills and processes require d to manufacture and test the cable assemblies. Such personnel must assure proper bonding of the silicone/thermoplastic rubber to the contacts and the potting compound to prevent moisture intrusion and electrical failures. Additionally, personnel must assure proper adhesion of the molding material to areas without voids. Proper handling of the molding compound is an essential skill that is required to be mastered for the molding process. Also, exact installation of a spacer is critical to ensure necessary alignment of the 300-volt pin, a positional requirement. Certified solderers are also required to assure critical electrical contact of the components and assembly. Some examples of the specialized equipment are: plastic injection molding machine, multi-cavity fuze plug mold, silicone/thermoplastic rubber transfer processes, dies to stamp the split and lock rings, dispensing machine for potting material, humidity and salt spray chambers, curing oven, optical comparator and continuity/hi-pot testers. The technical data package (TDP) is classified as Distribution D, limited distribution. Distribution Statement D means that interested parties must be registered with the U.S./Canada Joint Certification Program Office to obtain a copy of the top drawings. (see http://www.dlis.dla.mil/jcp/default.asp for registration instructions and DD Form 2345). After receipt of required certification, request a copy of the top drawings via email to hillm@osc.army.mil. Request must include your cage code, Company name, ad dress, phone number, email address, certification number and point of contact.  A respondent to this sources sought survey must have available facilities, equipment, skills and personnel to produce the cable assembly. Only SERIOUSLY INTERESTED U.S./Canadian firms whom feel they are capable of producing the cable assembly are invited t o indicate their interest by providing the Government a brief description and summary of their companys capabilities, including a brief description of their facilities, personnel and past manufacturing experience as it relates to the above criteria. Inform ation should be submitted to: U.S. Army Field Support Command, ATTN:AMSFS-CCA-M/MARY HILL, 1 Rock Island Arsenal, Rock Island, Il 61299-6500, email hillm@osc.army.mil.  Responses due NO LATER THAN 12 MARCH 2004 and identify the M70 Series cable assembly so urces sought survey as the subject of your response. This sources sought is for planning purposes only and shall not be construed as a Request for Proposal or as an obligation on the part of the Government.

<SUBJECT>D -- Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) - Comprehensive Development and Maintenance of new system
<DESC>The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) intends to hold an Industry Day for interested small businesses to discuss the upcoming Federal Business Opportunities (FBO or FedBizOpps) acquisition.  The government requires a contractor for comprehensive development of a new system and/or management of the system currently maintained and operated as the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) System.  FBO serves as the single Government-wide Point of Entry (GPE) for federal agencies and contractors for federal procurement opportunities.  The FBO Industry Day will be held on February 25, 2004 from 9:00 am to 11:00 am, registration starting at 8:30 am, at the GSA Auditorium located at 18th and F Streets N. W., Washington D.C.  To enter the building, security requires two picture ID’s.  Written comments to this synopsis should be submitted by noon (EST) February 20, 2004 to Robert.abood@gsa.gov AND pat.clark@gsa.gov   It is preferable that comments be provided in advance, however additional written comments may be submitted during Industry Day.  The acquisition will be set aside for small businesses, and it is anticipated the award will be a performance based contract.

FBO is mandated by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR Part 5), and supports a key Federal E-Government objective on improving access to open market contracting opportunities through technology.  Through one portal, commercial vendors seeking Federal markets for their products and services can search, monitor and retrieve opportunities from the entire Federal contracting community.  Government buyers are able to publicize their business opportunities by posting information directly to FedBizOpps.  

FedBizOpps can be found at www.fedbizopps.gov or www.fbo.gov   Attached to this synopsis is a link to the current version of the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and related documents.  These documents are located within FedTeDS.  For FedTeDS registration information go to  www.fedteds.gov and click on the “Registering with FedTeDS” link and follow the instructions.  Response to your registration request requires 48 hours.  NOTE:  THE FBO SOO AND RELATED DOCUMENTS ARE LOCATED IN FEDTEDS, HOWEVER INTERESTED VENDORS WHO HAVE REGISTERED WITH FEDTEDS MUST LINK TO FEDTEDS THROUGH THE FBO SYNOPSIS.  

A fixed price incentive contract is anticipated and the term of the contract will consist of a 3-year base period, with 5 potential one year award terms, not to exceed a maximum of 8 years.  When the Government releases the Request for Proposals (RFP), by using this Statement of Objectives (SOO) method, all offerors will be allowed the flexibility to develop cost-effective solutions and will have the opportunity to propose innovative alternatives meeting the stated objectives in the SOO.  The SOO shall be used by the offerors to develop their proposed Performance Work Statement, their Contractor Master Plan which includes their technical approach, performance standards, and a quality assurance surveillance plan, based upon commercial business practices, and any other documents required by the RFP.

<SUBJECT>73 -- REQUEST FOR INFORMATION SOUTHBRIDGE FOOD SERVICES
<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY 

This is not a solicitation for services.  It is only a market research tool.

Statement of Requirements for DFAS-Sponsored Food Services, Southbridge Hotel and Conference Center, Southbridge, Massachusetts

The Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) is seeking interested vendors to provide catered food service for meals and breaks within the Southbridge Hotel and Conference Center, Southbridge, Massachusetts, whenever DFAS is in residence.  The Agency requires both pre-planned and on-demand food services for a variety of DFAS training and conference events that are conducted at the hotel and conference facility each year.  DFAS previously received food service support from the Southbridge in-house restaurant.  The restaurant closed in December 2003, and therefore the Agency requires an alternate food service provider.  The purpose of this RFI is to gauge industry interest and receive feedback in preparation for release of a Request For Quotation.  Response must include a separate pricing estimate for each of the three types of food service listed below. 

The population to be supported will vary depending on the event but will generally be between 15-100 individuals. Vendors should be prepared to make food service available with or without the use of a full kitchen.

The Agency is interested in obtaining three types of food service:

1. A standard “package” of Basic Services (minimum requirement) 
2. Additional “a la carte” services, purchased as needed and priced separately
3. Banquet Services, purchased as needed and priced separately

Examples of representative food and beverage items are included below to assist interested parties with the pricing strategy.  The Government does not require premium fare or unique offerings.  The Government is flexible in its menu requirements and desires to take advantage of bulk pricing and combination orders with other clients where possible.  Requests for “a la carte” items and Banquet Services will be coordinated in advance of the event to ensure the food service supplier will have sufficient time to accommodate the request.

In the FIRST PHASE, or Summary Phase, persons, organizations, and government activities interested in participating will submit a document called a Defense Acquisition Challenge Program Summary Proposal.  A DACP Summary Proposal is a brief summary of the proposed project.  The Summary Proposal compares and contrasts the current technology, or lack there  of, with the proposed technology, its application and benefits.  It will include: 1) a description of the technology, product, or process to be evaluated, 2) a summary of its capabilities and the potential benefit(s) to the program of inserting the techno logy/product/process, 3) identification of the DoD Acquisition Category (ACAT) designation of the program that the capabilities will be aligned and/or incorporated against, 4) a cost estimate, including methodology, for the test article acquisition or prop osed technology or process improvement, and 5) current maturity state of proposed project, including estimated test phases for evaluation approach.  A Summary Proposal and Quad Chart are required during the summary phase.  The Summary Proposal and Quad Cha rt templates can be retrieved on the DACP Bids website (https://www.bids.acqcenter.com/dacp).  Although not required, a letter of interest from the DoD Program Management Office or Program Executive Office responsible for the ACAT program may be submitted in conjunction with the Summary Proposal.  All Summary Proposals received will be subjected to peer and scientific review.  Evaluation criteria for project selection at the Summary Proposal Phase are: (A) whether the proposal has merit; (B) whether the pro posal is likely to result in improvements in performance, affordability, manufacturability, or operational capability at the component, subsystem, or system lev el of an acquisition program; (C) whether the proposal could be implemented in the acquisition program rapidly, at an acceptable cost, and without unacceptable disruption to the acquisition program.  Summary proposals that meet the requirements as outlined  above will be prioritized based on potential for providing innovative and cost-saving technologies or products into existing Department of Defense acquisition programs.  An acquisition program of record (POR) that has been identified as potentially benefi ting from the proposed technology or product will be asked to conduct an independent review of the Summary Proposal.  The DoD Program Manager, in collaboration with the prime system contractor on the program, will decide whether to sponsor, or accept, the proposal.  In the SECOND PHASE, or Final Phase, PORs that have accepted the Summary Proposal will be extended an invitation to develop and submit a Final Proposal to compete for DACP funding to evaluate the proposed technology.  The purpose of the Final Pr oposal is for the sponsoring government program office to identify the issue, the means by which the technology or product will resolve or improve the issue, DACP funding required to evaluate the technology or product, the length of the evaluation will tak e, and the program officeÃ¢Â€Â™s plan to transition the technology or product if it meets the programs requirements.  Final Proposals may request funding for test article acquisition, test and evaluation of the test article, appropriate vendor cost, integr ation costs, and some government program office costs.  DACP funds cannot be used to implement the technology or product if successful.  Persons, organizations, and government activities submitting DACP Summary Proposals that meet the requirements as outli ned above and are accepted by the acquisition program will be extended an invitation to work with the DoD sponsor to submit a Final Proposal.  The DACP Final Proposal will include: key performance parameters (those the technology/product/process must meet) ; test concept and schedule for the test planning, administration, and data analysis; a plan for integration (to include cost and schedule) of the technology or product into the acquisition program; test article cost; and a cost profile for the test and ev aluation of the technology/product/process for the intended application.  The integration plan must include all applicable certifications (safety, flight worthiness, insensitive munitions, operational utility, etc.) required to insert the product/technolog y/process into the acquisition program.  During the second phase a Government-led evaluation team will review all Final Proposals and assess each against the evaluation criteria set forth in Title 10, USC Section 2359b.  The Government review of the Final Proposals at the second and final phase will include all criteria listed above, as well as: (A) an assessment of the cost, ease, and likelihood of adopting the challenge proposal and implementing it in the acquisition program; and (B) consideration of any intellectual property issues associated with the Challenge Proposal.  Proposals will be selected for funding based on the Final Proposal assessment and the availability of Government funding.  Approximately $12 million is available for all FY2005 projects based on the PresidentÃ¢Â€Â™s Budget.  Thus, funding for participation is highly competitive, and cost to evaluate the proposed technology or product should be considered.  The final number of projects and respective funds allocated will be determined once  all final proposals have been received and evaluated and congress appropriates the funding for FY05.  Every attempt will be made to ensure that all submitters are notified of the outcome of their proposal(s).  Final FY05 selections are expected to be fina lized NLT 1 October, 2004.  All submissions into the Defense Acquisition Challenge website must be UNCLASSIFIED.  Classified submissions, up to SECRET, can be a ccepted through the mail.  If a submittal contains classified information, the offeror must first obtain a DOCUMENT IDENTIFIER number through BIDS for tracking purposes and identify in the comments section why the submittal cannot be uploaded and submitted  via the automated system.  The BIDS tracking number must be clearly marked on the mailed submittal.  Classified responses must be appropriately marked, sealed and mailed in accordance with classified handling procedures.  All classified documents must be packaged and shipped in accordance with regulations and instructions pertaining to the level of classification.  Classified proposals must adhere to the same Summary Proposal and Quad Chart formats provided on the website.  For classified submittals, send an email to defensechallenge@osd.mil.  Mailing instructions will provided at that time. Classified documents must be mailed and must be received by the applicable due date and time.  Classification does not in any way eliminate the offerorÃ¢Â€Â™s requireme nt to comply with all instructions in the BAA.  Notification of rejections will be emailed to the Summary Proposal submitter. In general, debriefings of the summary proposals are not anticipated.  It should be generally assumed that the reason a proposal w as not considered for further review was due to failure to meet the requirements for DACP or limited funding availability.  This should not be construed as a commitment by the Government and any information submitted by industry will not constitute an offe r that could be accepted by the Government to create a binding contract. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this Request for Information or otherwise pay for the information solicited.  Persons submitting proposals are advis ed that only the Contracting Officer may obligate the government to any agreement involving expenditure of government funds.  While this BAA and evaluation process meet the requirements for fair and open competition, the final determination will reside wit h the DoD contracting officer from the Sponsoring organization.  Proposals must be received/submitted via the DACP website NLT 2400 hours EST, 1 March 2004.  Summary Proposals submitted after the deadline will have to be submitted as an UNSOLICITED PROPOSA L and may result in the proposal not being considered for funding during the initial selection cycle.  All Summary Proposal submissions must comply with the Submission Guidelines and use the FY05 templates provided on the website.  Failure to comply with t he above instructions may result in the rejection of the proposal during the administrative review.  Questions regarding DACP should be directed to defensechallenge@osd.mil or 703-788-9361.

2.	PROJECT INFORMATION:
The National Pipeline Mapping System (NPMS) is a GIS database that contains the locations and selected attributes of hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipelines, breakout tanks, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities operating in onshore and offshore territories of the United States where the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) has authority to regulate pipeline facilities.  The NPMS was developed as a joint effort between the U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), other Federal and state agencies, and the pipeline industry.  The NPMS originally consisted of pipeline and LNG facility data voluntarily submitted by pipeline operators.  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (codified at 49 U.S.C., 60132) requires that pipeline operators submit their hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipeline and LNG data to the NPMS.  The data collected for the NPMS is necessary for regulatory oversight and for monitoring the security of the pipelines.

The NPMS National Repository is operated and maintained by a contractor working on behalf of OPS.  The current National Repository began operation in 1998. The current contractor has assisted in finalizing the first NPMS Operator Standards in March 1999; developing procedures for collecting, editing, and processing pipeline and LNG geospatial data; developing quality control procedures; advising OPS on technical issues; developing and maintaining the NPMS homepage at www.npms.rspa.dot.gov; developing Web-based GIS applications; providing system integrity and security; providing on-site GIS support in OPS; updating the NPMS Operator Standards in January 2003; and updating the NPMS Repository Standards in March 2003.  The latest standards are available from the NPMS website at www.npms.rspa.dot.gov.

The NPMS originally consisted of a single National Repository and multiple state repositories.  In September 2002, OPS ended the state repository program in favor of using a single National Repository for the processing and storage of the NPMS geospatial data. The National Repository is responsible for processing and maintaining pipeline data, LNG facilities, and breakout tanks.  Pipeline operators are required to make updated submissions to the NPMS as changes occur along their pipeline system.

SELECTION CRITERIA:  See FedBizOps numbered Note 24 for a general description of the selection process. Following an initial evaluation of the qualification and performance data submitted, three or more firms considered to be most highly qualified to provide the type of services required will be chosen for negotiation.  Selection of firms for negotiation will be through an order of precedence based on demonstrated competence and qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the type of professional services required that include the following criteria which are of equal importance: (a) Demonstrated specialized experience and technical competence in: (1) managing and maintaining large relational geospatial databases in a GIS, including demonstrated experience in working with the full line of ESRI software including ArcGIS 8.x, ArcSDE, ArcIMS, ArvView 3.x and Oracle RDBMS, (2) working with U.S. hazardous liquid and gas transmission pipeline companies and their respective data records, and (3) converting digital data, digitizing paper maps, managing relational databases, projecting data, and performing quality-control processes. (b) Demonstrated capacity to accomplish the work in the required time. (c) Adequacy of in-house technical expertise to provide technical writing, Web support, application development, and on-site staffing. (d) The professional qualifications and composition of the proposed project team as a whole, and the experience of individual team members as directly related to the services described in criteria a, b, and c above.  Any firm or joint venture that augments its in-house staff by contracting with consultants must perform a majority of the services with in-house staff.

(vi)	Statement of Work

BACKGROUND
The ship’s service and control air compressors on the T-AO 187 Class vessels need to be replaced.  The Nash liquid ring rotary compressor units are inefficient to operate, costly to repair, and maintenance intensive.  MSC requires a replacement for the current models with a more efficient, more reliable type of air compressor that has an economically feasible preventative maintenance program.  The ship’s service air system requires clean, dry, oil-free air to serve various shops, whistles, atomizing, and tool hose services.  The control air system serves various pneumatically operated valves, main engine clutch control, shaft brake, and various control valves.
