The Government plans to utilize a firm fixed price contract with a 2-year base and three 1-year options.  This is a sole source requirement to Longbow Limited Liability Company (LBL), Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code 04WF2, 5600 Sand Lake Road, Orlando, FL 32819.  LBL is the original developer and manufacturer of the FCR and also current provider of PPSS to the United States Government (USG) and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers, including RSLFAC.  LBL is the only source that can provide the latest technical data and resolve technical problems incident to operation and maintenance of the aircraft, as it is the only source that has access to all current data to include proprietary data, which is only available from the prime contractor.  As such, LBL is the only source capable of providing PPSS for its FCR systems.  Only LBL possesses the technical expertise and experience necessary to execute this requirement.  Under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1), only one source or a limited number of responsible sources are able to satisfy agency requirements.

<CONTACT>Howard D. Bish, Phone 4123865848, Email hbish@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsible for conducting acquisitions in support of the National Institute for Occupation Safety and Health (NIOSH).
<p><br />The Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has a requirement to conduct research, exploratory development, testing, or evaluations of new technologies to improve mine safety, or to adapt technologies from other industries for application in mining environments. The primary interest of this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is to promote the modification or final development of practical robotics technologies or systems that can be adopted by the mining community in a short period of time to support self-escape or mine rescue efforts. Under this specific solicitation, proposals to conduct theoretical or basic research will not be considered.</p>
<p>Focus Areas:<br />Following are four focus areas that are currently envisioned for the use of robotics assistance during escape and rescue operations. These areas are provided to guide responders in addressing the highest priorities of NIOSH. However, NIOSH strongly encourages responders to propose practical robotics solutions to health and safety issues that are outside of these areas.<br /><br />1. Before and during rescue operations there is a need to identify the conditions within the mine and the viability of any trapped miners. These areas may be miles from areas that can be safely accessed by the rescue teams, and therefore can only be reached through boreholes. These boreholes are generally 2 to 8 inches in diameter. OMSHR is interested in robots that can be lowered through the boreholes and then navigated through the mine providing visual and atmospheric information to the operator on the surface.</p>
<p>2. When exploring the mine, rescue teams may encounter conditions in front of their direction of progress that are unknown or could possibly be too dangerous to explore without more information. These areas may be scattered with debris and rock, which makes navigation by a robot challenging, additionally the height of the entry may be as low as three feet. OMSHR is interested in robotics technology that can explore several thousand feet ahead of the rescue teams and provide visual and atmospheric information to the rescued team at the fresh air base.</p>
<p>3. During rescue operations, the rescue members may need to remove injured miners or carry similarly heavy loads into and out of the mine. OMSHR is interested in robotics technology that can provide a "pack mule" capability for the rescue teams on a fully or semi-autonomous basis.</p>
<p>4. A problem which is unique to coal mining and other gassy mining environments facing any robotics development is the possible ignition of methane by electrical energy associated with the robot. The power limitations created by intrinsic safety requirements and additional weight associated with explosion proof boxes, greatly limits the types of robots that can be used. OMSHR is interested in explosion protection technologies that can be applied to robots to minimize or eliminate the possibility of explosion with minimal impact on the mobility and weight of the robots. The proposed solution can be either a general solution or incorporated with a solution to one of the three topic areas described previously.<br />This requirement is solicited on a full and open competition - unrestricted basis.</p>
<p>The complete solicitation document and reference material will be available for downloading at www.fedbizopps.gov on or about 15 calendar days after the posting of this notice. No verbal or written requests for copies will be accepted.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of prospective offerors to stay abreast of additional postings regarding this solicitation at the FedBizOpps Internet site.</p>

<RESPDATE>041314
<CONTACT>Leslie D. Jones, Contract Specialist, Phone 7704882042, Email jxy6@cdc.gov
<DESC>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), intends to award a sole source contract to PerkinElmer, 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT, 06484-4794 for the acquisition of a Perkin-Elmer Sciclone liquid handler system and associated ancillary hardware and software for real-time sequencing of enteric disease isolates for rapid DNA library preparation for public health surveillance of foodborne illnesses.<br />&nbsp;
<p>The statutory authority for this sole source acquisition is 10 U.S.C 2304(c)(1) in accordance with FAR Part 6.302-1- only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy the agency requirement. The NAICS code for this procurement is 334516, Analytical Laboratory Instrument Manufacturing. The period of performance for this procurement is 12 months.</p>
<p>The Enterics Disease Laboratory Branch (EDLB) has performed classic biochemical, phenotypic, and gel-electrophoresis based testing to characterize isolate samples. The advent of next-generation whole-genome sequencing has made rapid, inexpensive and accurate whole genome sequencing of bacterial isolates in real time a possibility. This method provides far greater resolution than any existing biochemical, phenotypic, or gel-based test, as well as comparable data across samples separated by time and geography. Next generation sequencing enables the simultaneous capture of information about variation, virulence, antibiotic resistance, and origin. Following the successful deployment of this approach on listeria isolate samples, EDLB seeks to expand next-generation sequencing to other enteric disease isolates. Preparing DNA samples extracted from specimen isolates for sequencing requires processing to append the correct adapters and indices, and select for desired fragments. The Perkin-Elmer Sciclone Workstation is the only instrument that is capable of performing this preparation in a high-throughput fashion.</p>
<p>Compared to other liquid handler robots, this instrument is unique in its ability to prepare high quality sequencing libraries in a high-throughput format. The Perkin-Elmer Sciclone NGSx Workstation is the only automation system currently on the market that can handle our sample capacity (16-96 samples) as well as supports the different library preparation chemistries we have already validated for next generation sequencing. This instrument is the only one currently on the market that incorporates reagent temperature control. The Sciclone NGSx also rapidly prepares libraries for sequencing which is required for public health disease surveillance.<br />The PerkinElmer system integrates DNA quantification data from a plate reader in its operation and supports a fully automated workflow. It also contains Peltier cooling units to keep reagents on the platform cool before use. This is particularly important for enzymes used in the different library preparations.</p>
<p>This device has many validated programs using off-the-self kits which allow great flexibility in usage. Finally, this device is flexible enough to be adapted as new preparation protocols come to market.</p>
<p>Manufacturers of other high throughput liquid handlers were researched, however, no other vendor has the wide a range of ready and validated programs which are needed in the laboratory.</p>
<p>As a result of this synopsis, no competitive solicitation will be posted on FedBizOpps. We will issue only one solicitation to PerkinElmer. However, all responsible sources that believe they can meet these requirements may submit their capabilities/qualifications statement to provide the services to Leslie Jones via email ONLY at jxy6@cdc.gov with the solicitation number 2014-69546 referenced in the subject line NO LATER THAN April 13, 2014.</p>
<p>A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed action will be based on responses to this notice and are solely within the discretion of the Contracting Officer. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>

<CONTACT>Scott Frankel, Phone 2022456822, Email scott.frankel@ed.gov
<DESC><p>The U.S. Department of Education (Department) has a requirement for the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to collect and report statistical data on the condition of education in the United States. To this end, NCES must work closely with State Education Agencies (SEAs) to ensure that the education data supplied to NCES are uniform, timely, and comparable. The primary purpose of this requirement is to establish a cooperative partnership that allows for NCES to work in support of states efforts to provide NCES with the educational data and information necessary to meet the Departments goal to make informed decisions and improve instruction through the use of data.</p>
<p>This requirement has been developed to meet the goals set for the Partnership Program by establishing a contract mechanism through which NCES will support SEA participation in the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) State Coordinator Program and related efforts to improve the implementation of NAEP in the states and other activities requiring involvement of the SEA's and NCES. NCES is providing funding for states to hire a full-time NAEP State Coordinator who serves as the liaison between the SEA and NCES. The Coordinator's duties include implementing and coordinating the NAEP administration in the state, promoting understanding and use of NAEP, and analyzing and reporting NAEP results.</p>
<p>This requirement also supports participation in the Cooperative System and related projects designed to ensure uniform, comparable, and timely data. NCES anticipates that SEAs will work with the Center in the spirit of cooperation and mutual support that have characterized previous efforts to improve the quality of national education statistics.</p>
<p>The Department seeks to negotiate and award sole-source firm-fixed-price contracts to 50 or how many SEAs in support of Public Law 107-279 Education Science Reform Act of 2002 and Public Law 107-110 No Child Left Behind, the Department will contract with SEAs to support participation in the NCES State Partnership System.</p>
<p>THIS NOTICE IS NOT A REQUEST FOR COMPETITIVE PROPOSALS and a solicitation will not be issued.</p>

<DESC>*** If you are viewing this announcement on any other site, except the FAA Contracting Opportunites website, please go to https://faaco.faa.gov to view it in its entirety with attachments.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has an upcoming requirement for the supply of new, and maintenance of new and existing printers, copiers and scanners, as well as the supply of toner and ink cartridges.  This requirement may support the entire FAA and Department of Transportation (DOT).  The areas of service coverage are both CONUS and OCONUS.

Attachment I entitled, Requirements is included for informational purposes only to outline the broad scope of the envisioned work.  Also included with this survey is Attachment II, Hardware List, which is a draft assessment of the current assets the FAA maintains.  This list is in draft form, and does not include all of the assets the FAA maintains, nor any of DOTs assets.

This market survey is not a Screening Information Request (SIR) or a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred in preparing the response to the market survey.

At this time, the nature of the competition has not been determined.  The FAA may decide to do a full and open competition or set aside all or part of the procurement for small business concerns.

The purpose of this market survey is to solicit statements of capabilities from interested parties.  This market survey is also being conducted in order to obtain the information necessary to determine whether adequate competition exists to set-aside the requirement among small business concerns.  

The principle North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code anticipated for this effort is 333244, Printing Machinery and Equipment Manufacturing, with a small business size standard of 500 employees.  A secondary NAICS code that may be considered for this effort is 334118, Computer Terminal or Other Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing, with a small business size of 1,000 employees.  A wholesale trade or retail trade business submitting a capability statement on a supply acquisition is categorized as a non-manufacturer and deemed small if it has 500 or fewer employees and meets the requirements of 13 CFR 121.406. 

In order to make this determination, the FAA requires the following information from interested vendors:

PLEASE NOTE THERE IS NO PAGE LIMITATION, HOWEVER SUBMISSIONS SHOULD PROVIDE RELEVANT CONCISE INFORMATION ONLY.


Capability Statement  This document should identify:

1. Your companys capability to provide supplies and services to the agency as described by Attachment I, Requirements, including geographical areas where your company can provide services.

<CONTACT>Laura B. Harshbarger, Phone 3014477611, Email laura.harshbarger@dhs.gov
<DESC><p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency intends to negotiate on a sole source basis (IAW FAR 13.5) with PerkinElmer Health Sciences, 710 Bridgeport Avenue, Shelton, CT, 06484-4794, as the only responsible source that can provide PerkinElmer chemical laboratory analysis equipment to the Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP), in Anniston, AL.</p>
<p>PerkinElmer is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of the existing air monitoring equipment that is located in the Chemical, Ordinance, Biological, and Radiological Training Facility (COBRATF) at the CDP. Additional equipment is required in order to maintain a satisfactory level of air monitoring proficiency.</p>
<p>The COBRATF requires two each Clarus 580 Gas Chromatograph (GC) systems and accessories (specific item numbers and quantities attached). The Clarus 580 GC is a GC/ATD/ALS system manufactured and distributed solely by PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. and designed to automatically prep and desorb the COBRATF's 6mm-OD stainless steel Depot Area Air Monitoring System (DAAMS) tubes without any manual manipulation. The COBRATF also requires the GC/ATD/ALS systems' GC columns to switch from ATD to ALS without the need to manually move the columns from one inlet to the other. Since the GC/ATD/ALS systems will be used on a daily basis, the capability to desorb and analyze a minimum of 50 samples is essential to support operations. The GC/ATD/ALS systems must also be equipped with a Flame Photometric Detector that is sensitive to phosphorus compounds.</p>
<p>The GC/ATD/ALS system that best meets the specific laboratory requirements of the COBRATF is limited on the commercial market to PerkinElmer Health Sciences, Inc. Competing vendors provide nearly comparable systems; however, the systems analyzed through research of the marketplace do not meet the requirements for automated decapping (i.e., prepping) and desorption of the DAAMS tubes utilized in the COBRATF's air monitoring program. Notably, the DAAMS tubes utilized at the COBRATF, configured with pin clips and PTFE caps, are required per the COBRATF's laboratory operations and protocols.</p>
<p>In addition to the above information, if this requirement was awarded to a supplier other than PerkinElmer, there is an anticipated duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.</p>
<p>This acquisition is being conducted under simplified acquisition procedures for (IAW FAR 13.5 Test Program for Certain Commercial Items). There are no set-aside restrictions for this requirement. The intended procurement will be classified under North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 334516 with a Small Business Size Standard of 500 employees. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals and no solicitation document exists for this requirement. However, parties interested in responding to this notice will need to submit technical data, sufficient to determine capability in providing the same instruments, meeting the same specifications. All capability statements received within 10 days after publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete based on responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.</p>
<p>Capability statements shall be submitted by email only as a MS Word or Adobe PDF attachment to Laura Harshbarger at laura.harshbarger@fema.dhs.gov. Statements are due by 12:00 PM EST, April 7, 2014. No phone calls accepted.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION:</p>
<p>The Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), intends to negotiate a firm fixed price purchase order, on a sole source basis, with Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC of Thornwood, NY, for the purchase of a NanoPatterning and Visualization Engine (NPVE) upgrade for the CNST Zeiss NVision focused ion beam scanning electron microscope system. Under other than full and open competition by the authority of FAR 13.106(b)(1). Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements:</p>
<p>A sole source determination is based on the following: Only Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC can meet our technical requirements.</p>
<p>Specifically no other vendor can meet the NIST requirements for:</p>
<p>NanoPatterning and Visualization Engine (NPVE) upgrade for the CNST Zeiss NVision focused ion beam scanning electron microscope system.</p>
<p>NIST is the current owner and Zeiss is the original manufacturer of the equipment. <br />This purchase will include both hardware components proprietary to Carl Zeiss Microscopy (Zeiss) and installation and training services requiring expert knowledge of proprietary Zeiss systems.<br />The additional hardware, custom software and engineering expertise required for the NPVE addition are only available from Zeiss because NPVE is a Zeiss proprietary patterning and visualization add-on engine developed for Zeiss microscope systems and sold, installed and maintained through Zeiss. Zeiss does not have authorized service providers or vendors for their product.<br />A modification of the NVision system without Zeiss authorization or by 3rd party vendors without Zeiss authorization will void the current service contract</p>
<p>There are no other re-sellers.</p>
<p>The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this acquisition is 334516, and the size standard is 500 employees.</p>
<p>No solicitation package will be issued.

<DESC>Introduction
<p>The mission of the Division of Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (DAIDS), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is to ensure an end to the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) epidemic by supporting research that can lead to the prevention, treatment, and eventual cure of HIV disease.</p>
<p>HIV-1 replication can be effectively suppressed in HIV infected patients using highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). However, despite effective suppressive therapy, HIV has been known to exist in a state of latency, with the best characterized latent reservoir being the resting memory CD4+ T cells. These resting cells produce HIV when their resting state is reversed following cellular activation. To achieve a cure for HIV disease, an important DAIDS scientific priority, the latent reservoir of HIV needs to be identified and eliminated.</p>
<p>DAIDS supports basic research as well as pre-clinical and clinical evaluation of various HIV eradication strategies. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies at clearing the latent reservoir, a reproducible assay capable of quantifying latent HIV is crucial. The best characterized assay today is the QVOA (Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay), also known as IUPM assay (Infectious Units Per Million) (Siliciano and Siliciano 2005), performed on highly purified resting CD4+ T cells under conditions that reverse latency and induce replication of HIV. However, QVOA measurements require large volumes of blood, are expensive, tedious, and labor intensive and therefore not the assay of choice for many laboratories conducting HIV eradication research.</p>
<p>NIAID has a requirement to provide the QVOA as a service to the HIV research community. This service will allow standardized QVOA measurements so that unbiased comparisons between different eradication strategies can be achieved. Widespread use of the assay will raise the standards for latent HIV detection and reduce the need for surrogate, less accurate assays, presently used by some laboratories.</p>
<p>The scope of the work includes:</p>
<p>&bull;	Performance of the QVOA <br />&bull;	Development of alternative assays to the QVOA. The aim will be the development of assays that are less costly, require smaller amounts of blood, and can be completed more rapidly, while maintaining or exceeding the sensitivity of the QVOA.<br />&bull;	Training investigators to perform the QVOA at the Respondent's site</p>
<p>The Contractor shall use state-of-the art technologies to accomplish the objectives and shall incorporate new and improved technologies into activities when appropriate.</p>
<p>Options: The Government may exercise options, at its discretion, to extend the term of the contract beyond the base period (Year 1), annually, for a total contract period of up to 7 years. Assume that the scope and types of activities as outlined herein (i.e., for Year 1 of the contract) would be continued for each succeeding annual contract period up to 7 total years.</p>
<p>In addition, the Government may exercise options for an increased level of effort that may result from unanticipated increases in demand for the services supported by the base requirements of this contract.  Options for increased services may include the following:</p>
<p>Increased Level of Effort for Additional Services:  During the course of the contract it may be necessary to incorporate additional services to support new NIAID-supported clinical studies and trials.  Such an increase would require an increase in the Contractor's activities to be activated, at the discretion of the Government, as an option.  Each option of this type will implement work commensurate with the addition of .55 FTEs to perform and estimated 80 additional assays.  One (1) but not more than two (2) Options may be exercised in any one year.</p>
<p>Proposals will be evaluated for technical approach, scientific and technical personnel, project management, resources, facilities, equipment, and capability to address options.</p>
<p>Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal which will be considered by the Agency.  This RFP will be available electronically on/about April 14, 2014, and may be accessed through FedBizOpps http://www.fedbizopps.gov/.  This notice does not commit the Government to award a contract.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmissions will be accepted.</p>
<p>For this solicitation, the NIAID requires proposals to be submitted via two methods: (1)<br />Disc (CD or DVD) and (2) Online via the NIAID electronic Contract Proposal Submission (eCPS) website. The content of the disc and online proposals must be identical. Submission of proposals by facsimile or e-mail is not acceptable.</p>

(1) Unless exempted by an addendum to this contract, the Contractor is responsible during performance and through final payment of any contract for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government?s reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document. (2) (i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, ?doing business as? name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in Subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day?s written notification of its intention to: (A) Change the name in the SAM database; (B) Comply with the requirements of Subpart 42.12 of the FAR; (C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor must provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support the legally changed name. (ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (t)(2)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (t)(2)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of Payment? paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract. (3) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR Subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM database. Information provided to the Contractor?s SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the ?Suspension of payment? paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract. (4) Offerors and Contractors may obtain information on registration and annual confirmation requirements via SAM accessed through https://www.acquisition.gov. <BR> <BR>(u) Unauthorized Obligations. (1) Except as stated in paragraph (u)(2) of this clause, when any supply or service acquired under this contract is subject to any End Use License Agreement (EULA), Terms of Service (TOS), or similar legal instrument or agreement, that includes any clause requiring the Government to indemnify the Contractor or any person or entity for damages, costs, fees, or any other loss or liability that would create an Anti-Deficiency Act violation (31 U.S.C. 1341), the following shall govern: (i) Any such clause is unenforceable against the Government. (ii) Neither the Government nor any Government authorized end user shall be deemed to have agreed to such clause by virtue of it appearing in the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. If the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement is invoked through an ?I agree? click box or other comparable mechanism (e.g., ?click-wrap? or ?browse-wrap? agreements), execution does not bind the Government or any Government authorized end user to such clause. (iii) Any such clause is deemed to be stricken from the EULA, TOS, or similar legal instrument or agreement. (2) Paragraph (u)(1) of this clause does not apply to indemnification by the Government that is expressly authorized by statute and specifically authorized under applicable agency regulations and procedures. (End of Clause) Alternate I (Aug 2012) When a time-and-materials or labor-hour contract is contemplated, substitute the following paragraphs (a), (e), (i), (l), and (m) for those in the basic clause.

The Government will perform inspections and tests in a manner that will not unduly delay the work.

Except as otherwise specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this clause, the cost of replacement or correction shall be determined under paragraph (i) of this clause, but the ?hourly rate? for labor hours incurred in the replacement or correction shall be reduced to exclude that portion of the rate attributable to profit. Unless otherwise specified below, the portion of the ?hourly rate? attributable to profit shall be 10 percent. The Contractor shall not tender for acceptance materials and services required to be replaced or corrected without disclosing the former requirement for replacement or correction, and, when required, shall disclose the corrective action taken. [Insert portion of labor rate attributable to profit.] (5) (i) If the Contractor fails to proceed with reasonable promptness to perform required replacement or correction, and if the replacement or correction can be performed within the ceiling price (or the ceiling price as increased by the Government), the Government may?

(ii) Failure to agree to the amount of increased cost to be charged to the Contractor shall be a dispute under the Disputes clause of the contract. (6) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a)(4) and (5) above, the Government may at any time require the Contractor to remedy by correction or replacement, without cost to the Government, any failure by the Contractor to comply with the requirements of this contract, if the failure is due to-- (i) Fraud, lack of good faith, or willful misconduct on the part of the Contractor?s managerial personnel; or (ii) The conduct of one or more of the Contractor?s employees selected or retained by the Contractor after any of the Contractor?s managerial personnel has reasonable grounds to believe that the employee is habitually careless or unqualified. (7) This clause applies in the same manner and to the same extent to corrected or replacement materials or services as to materials and services originally delivered under this contract. <BR> <BR>(8) The Contractor has no obligation or liability under this contract to correct or replace materials and services that at time of delivery do not meet contract requirements, except as provided in this clause or as may be otherwise specified in the contract.

Fractional parts of an hour shall be payable on a prorated basis. (B) The rates shall be paid for all labor performed on the contract that meets the labor qualifications specified in the contract.

(E) Unless the Schedule prescribes otherwise, the hourly rates in the Schedule shall not be varied by virtue of the Contractor having performed work on an overtime basis.

(A) If the Contractor furnishes materials that meet the definition of a commercial item at FAR 2.101, the price to be paid for such materials shall not exceed the Contractor?s established catalog or market price, adjusted to reflect the-- (1) Quantities being acquired; and (2) Any modifications necessary because of contract requirements. (B) Except as provided for in paragraph (i)(1)(ii)(A) and (D)(2) of this clause, the Government will reimburse the Contractor the actual cost of materials (less any rebates, refunds, or discounts received by the contractor that are identifiable to the contract) provided the Contractor?

It is estimated that the total cost to the Government for the performance of this contract shall not exceed the ceiling price set forth in the Schedule and the Contractor agrees to use its best efforts to perform the work specified in the Schedule and all obligations under this contract within such ceiling price. If at any time the Contractor has reason to believe that the hourly rate payments and material costs that will accrue in performing this contract in the next succeeding 30 days, if added to all other payments and costs previously accrued, will exceed 85 percent of the ceiling price in the Schedule, the Contractor shall notify the Contracting Officer giving a revised estimate of the total price to the Government for performing this contract with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during the performance of this contract, the Contractor has reason to believe that the total price to the Government for performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the then stated ceiling price, the Contractor shall so notify the Contracting Officer, giving a revised estimate of the total price for performing this contract, with supporting reasons and documentation. If at any time during performance of this contract, the Government has reason to believe that the work to be required in performing this contract will be substantially greater or less than the stated ceiling price, the Contracting Officer will so advise the Contractor, giving the then revised estimate of the total amount of effort to be required under the contract.

In the event of such termination, the Contractor shall immediately stop all work hereunder and shall immediately cause any and all of its suppliers and subcontractors to cease work. Subject to the terms of this contract, the Contractor shall be paid an amount for direct labor hours (as defined in the Schedule of the contract) determined by multiplying the number of direct labor hours expended before the effective date of termination by the hourly rate(s) in the contract, less any hourly rate payments already made to the Contractor plus reasonable charges the Contractor can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Government using its standard record keeping system that have resulted from the termination. The Contractor shall not be required to comply with the cost accounting standards or contract cost principles for this purpose. This paragraph does not give the Government any right to audit the Contractor?s records.

This part requires engineering source approval by the design control activity in order to maintain the quality of the part. Existing unique design capability, engineering skills, and manufacturing knowledge by the qualified source(s) require acquisition of the part from the approved source(s). The approved source(s) retain data rights, manufacturing knowledge, or technical data that are not economically available to the Government, and the data or knowledge is essential to maintaining the quality of the part. An alternate source must qualify in accordance with the design control activity's procedures,
as approved by the cognizant Government engineering activity. The qualification procedures must be approved by the Government engineering activity having jurisdiction over the part in the intended application.The subject item requires
Government source approval prior to contract award, as the item is flight critical and/or the technical data available has not been determined adequate to
support acquisition via full and open competition. Only the source(s) previously
approved by the Government for this item have been solicited. The time required for approval of a new source is normally such that an award cannot be delayed pending approval of a new source.

The subject requirement provides technical, analytical, and enforcement support for EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance (OECA), Office of Civil Enforcement (OCE). OCE is charged with the development, litigation, and settlement of administrative and civil judicial cases against violators of the environmental laws pursuant to the: Clean Water Act (CWA); Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuary Act (MPRSA); Clean Air Act (CAA); the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships; Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); Oil Pollution Act (OPA); Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); Federal Facility Compliance Act (FFCA); Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA); Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA); Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA); and Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act (Battery Ac t).
OCE's activities are diversely implemented under these authorities and in accordance with federal environmental statutes. Major activities include the following: developing national policy and guidance for technical evaluations, investigations, case development and settlement strategies; developing management controls and data systems for assisting with enforcement of, and monitoring compliance with, all national enforcement initiatives and programs; targeting, developing and implementing compliance assurance activities to monitor and improve compliance of the regulated pollution sources; ensuring effective enforcement of environmental requirements; compliance monitoring, including on-site inspections and investigations of pollution sources; motivating the regulated community to voluntarily discover, disclose and correct violations; developing and implementing, in association with the National Enforcement Training Institute (NETI), enforcement related training and workshops;  monitoring and enforcing federal, and federally-authorized, State programs; and providing support to Regions, States, Territories, Indian Tribes, and other regulatory authorities. 
The resultant contract for the discussed requirement will contain a Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC) clause, stipulating that: During the life of the contract, and for a period of seven (7) years after the completion of the contract, unless prior written approval is obtained from the cognizant EPA Contracting Officer, the Contractor shall not enter into a contract: (1) with owners or operators of facilities that may be impacted by enforcement and compliance activities performed under a Work Assignment, of the resulting contract, as regulated parties under the Clean Water Act (CWA); Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA); Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuary Act (MPRSA); Clean Air Act (CAA); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); Oil Pollution Act (OPA); Pollution Prevention Act (PPA); Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA); Superfund Reauthorization and Amendments Act (SARA); Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); Federal Facility Compliance Act ( FFCA); National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA); Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA); Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act (AHERA); and Mercury-Containing and Rechargeable Battery Management Act (Battery Act); or (2) to act as a consultant to any such regulated parties that may be impacted by enforcement and compliance activities performed under Work Assignment, of the resulting contract.
This will be a recompete of the two previous contracts EP-W-09-032 with Leidos (formerly SAIC) and EP-W-09-033 with ERG. This procurement will be a full-and-open competition with no small business set-asides.

<DESC>This presolicitation notice, in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 5.204, is issued by the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) to announce the intention to issue a solicitation for National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) Production and Science and Technical Intelligence (S&TI) Software Programs (NPSP).  <br> Reference the Sources Sought Notice posted under W911W5-14-R-NPSP on 15 November 2013 and the RFI # MAC0071 posted to https://www.fbo.gov on 20 September 2013. All postings will now be made available under Solicitation Number W911W5-14-R-0002.  <br>  <br> This synopsis is issued by the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC) solely for informational purposes in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) subpart 5.2, Synopses of Proposed Contract Actions. It does not constitute a Request for Proposal (RFP) or a guarantee to issue a formal solicitation. The primary purpose of this notice is to increase competition, broaden industry participation, and assist small business concerns in obtaining contracts and subcontracts. If a formal solicitation is released, it will be publicized via the Army Single Face to Industry (ASFI) acquisition business web site (https://acquisition.army.mil/asfi/) and posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website (https: //www.fbo.gov). It is the responsibility of the interested party to monitor these websites for any information that may pertain to this synopsis. The information provided in this synopsis is subject to change and shall not be interpreted as binding on the Government in any way. <br> The tentative date to post the solicitation W911W5-14-R-0002 to the FedBizOpps (https://www.fbo.gov) website is on, or about, 14 April 2014. Additional information, as it becomes available, will be posted to the FedBizOpps website as amendments to the announcement. It is incumbent upon all interested parties to review this website frequently for any updates and amendments to any and all documents.   <br>  <br> The acquisition strategy is to award a single contract for NPSP Support services. However, the Government reserves the right to make no award at all.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 541511, Custom Computer Programming Services, with a size standard of $25.5M.   <br>  <br> The contemplated contract vehicle is an Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract with a five-year ordering period and maximum ceiling of $49M.  The Government anticipates issuing task orders with Firm Fixed Price (FFP) CLINs for labor and Cost CLINs for materials and travel. The projected award date for the basic contract is August 2014 with a transition period leading up to the first task order period of performance which begins 1 September 2014. The period of performance for the first task order is 12-months from date of award.  The primary place of contract performance is the NGIC's facilities in Charlottesville, VA. <br>  <br> The NPSP requirement is for services supporting software engineering for major intelligence production applications, operations and maintenance support for legacy intelligence production applications, information assurance support to include ICD 503, DCID 6/3, DIACAP and CON process, requirements management, and cloud integration. <br> The Government requirement includes support for the following areas:  <br> 1.	Operations and Maintenance <br> The government requires support to maintain legacy applications through quarterly patch releases, IAVA updates and technology refreshes based on core infrastructure changes.  The NGIC currently deploys multiple different web servers that support JAVA or .NET and multiple database management systems.  The NGIC has roughly 10 applications that will require this support. <br> 2.	Software Engineering <br> The government requires software engineering support to increase and enhance functionality per mission requirements.  The contractor will need to follow a standard software development lifecycle provided by the government to perform this work.  Tasks might include re-architecting legacy applications to work with a newly identified architecture standard.  In most cases the vendor will be working offsite and will need to show a robust software configuration management plan to reduce the risk of integration failures.   <br> 3.	Information Assurance <br> The contract will need to develop the appropriate documentation package per network requirements.  The contractor needs to show experience in writing CON, ICD 503, DCID 6/3, and DIACAP.   <br> 4.	Requirements Management <br> The contractor will need to work with the government to develop a list of current and future requirements per industry standard best practices.    Based on the government prioritization the contractor will communicate the set of requirements to the development for implementation and validate the requirement is implemented to the governments standards during IV and V.      <br> 5.	Cloud Integration <br> The contractor will need to migrate identified legacy applications to Army, DoD or IC clouds.  The contractor needs to show experience in different cloud architectures and cloud data migration practices. <br> The NPSP acquisition will be a best value procurement utilizing FAR Part 15 competitive procedures. Based upon market research, the Government will conduct the NPSP procurement as a Total Small Business set aside. The contracting effort will be performance-based in accordance with FAR Subpart 37.6. <br>  <br> Performance requires a TOP SECRET contractor facility clearance.  Contractor personnel performing under this contract shall be U.S. Citizens, have a final TOP SECRET clearance with a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI), and shall be eligible for indoctrination to the Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) level.  Some positions may require a Polygraph examination if additional accesses are required.  The contractor is responsible for obtaining all necessary security clearances for contractor personnel.  This TOP SECRET level contractor facility clearance requirement may also apply to affiliates, team members, and subcontractors if they have access to classified information. <br>  <br> Matters of a routine or administrative nature concerning this acquisition should be addressed to William T. Bickley, Contract Specialist, phone (434) 980-7596 or email william.t.bickley.civ@mail.mil.  The Contracting Officer, Jessica C. Mullins, may be contacted at phone 434-951-1653 or email jessica.c.mullins.civ@mail.mil.

Since the data required to manufacture the KC-135 Wheel Heat Shields is limited to Messier-Bugatti, interested vendors would have to be willing to invest the time, funding, and manpower required to reverse engineer the entire KC-135 wheel and brake package at their own expense in order to qualify the Heat Shields with the rest of the system.
<p>Interested parties may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for proposals. Information received will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. All potential offerors should contact the buyer/PCO identified in this posting for additional information and/or to communicate concerns, if any, regarding this acquisition.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought Notice. It is NOT an invitiation for bid, solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the capabilities of qualified offerors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP) is seeking technical assistance from an offeror with expertise in designing and conducting clinical vaccine trials among older adults to assess the immune response to hepatitis A vaccine in accordance with possible use for post-exposure prophylaxis. The offeror will conduct a clinical trial with approval by the CDC and local Institutional Review Boards (IRB) and in compliance with IRB protocol and other appropriate HHS/CDC requirements for scientific research. The applicable NAICS code is 541712 with a size standard of 500 employees.
<p>Data are lacking on the effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccine for post-exposure prophylaxis among adults 40 years and older. The results of this study will inform development of updated U.S. post-exposure prophylaxis recommendations affecting adults &gt; 40 years of age. The current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations state that for persons aged &gt; 40 years, immunoglobulin (IG) is preferred; vaccine can be used if IG cannot be obtained. Hepatitis A vaccine generally is more readily available than IG for immediate use after exposure. Hepatitis A vaccination has the advantage over IG of inducing long-term protection and potential individual benefits, such as knowledge of protection against future exposures.</p>
<p>The primary objective is to determine the immunogenicity and safety of hepatitis A vaccination among healthy susceptible adults age &ge; 40 years by decade of life in comparison to a control group of healthy susceptible adults age 30-39 years.</p>
<p>Eligible offerors must have the access and capability to conduct research in a clinical setting, including appropriate confidentiality and protection of human subject assurances, and demonstrated experience with applying for and receiving local IRB approval for clinical trials. Eligible offerors will recruit subjects, determine eligibility of subjects, obtain blood samples, perform vaccinations, monitor safety, send aliquoted blood samples to the CDC Hepatitis Reference Laboratory for analysis, inform subjects of the results or laboratory testing, and document immunogenicity.</p>
<p>CDC has the following objectives:</p>
<p>1) To write a protocol consistent with the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) guidelines for conducting clinical research for a vaccine trial, and that will meet local and federal requirements for IRB approval. <br />2) To recruit an appropriate study population for the trial as specified in the performance work statement, including obtaining informed consent and collecting a medical history.<br />3) To collect and properly store blood samples (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HEV/PDFs/HRL_PCRSampleHndlgShpg_20080615.pdf), and ensure privacy and confidentiality; properly store vaccines (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/vac-storage.pdf).<br />4) To have laboratory capabilities to conduct laboratory tests for antibody titers, serology, and liver function. <br />5) To provide clinical staff who meet legal and licensure qualifications ensuring the ability to administer vaccine.<br />6) Demonstrated experience to perform scientific data analysis and prepare manuscripts for peer reviewed scientific journals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to assess the capabilities/experience, the offeror must have proven capabilities in the areas listed below. These areas will be the core requirements for the contemplated contract.</p>
<p>(1) Does your company have an OHRP assurance to conduct clinical research on human subjects?</p>
<p>(2) Does your company have demonstrated experience in writing a protocol for a vaccine trial that will meet local and federal Institutional Review Board approval?</p>
<p>(3) Does your company have demonstrated experience in designing and managing a clinical trial?</p>
<p>(4) Does your company have access to an appropriate patient population in order to recruit sufficient subjects such that the sample size for the study groups and controls is adequate to demonstrate a statistically significant effect with consideration of loss to follow-up? (The minimum sample size for each age group (40-49, 50-59, 60-69) is 100 and for the control group (30-39) is 50.)</p>
<p>(5) Does your company have demonstrated success in publishing peer-reviewed manuscripts with rigorous data analysis?</p>
<p>(6) Does your company have demonstrated experience in confidential collection and proper storage of blood samples; ability to conduct laboratory tests for antibody titers, serology, and liver function?</p>
<p><br />Teaming Arrangements: All teaming arrangements shall include the above-cited information and certifications for each entity on the proposed team. Teaming arrangements are encouraged.</p>
<p>Responses shall be limited to seven (7) pages, excluding the business information, single spaced, minimum Font Size 10, Times New Roman or Arial. Capability statements will not be returned and will not be accepted after the due date. Responses must be submitted via email no later than April 11, 2014, 4:00PM EST to Kim Morris at ycy1@cdc.gov.

<CONTACT>Sheliah Sheliah, Contract Specialist, Phone 2406126160, Email sheliah.j.mcdaniel.mil@mail.mil - Ramona L. Hanson, Contracting Officer, Phone 240-612-6192, Email ramona.l.hanson2.civ@mail.mil
<DESC>1. This is a Sources Sought for market research purposes only, and is not a Request for Proposal (RFP). A solicitation is not being issued at this time and this notice shall be not be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, nor does it restrict the Government to a particular acquisition approach.
<p><br />2. This sources sought is being published to identify potential sources capable of providing crime scene processing supplies to Headquaters Air Force Office of Special Investigations (HQ AFOSI) and the Department of Defense (DoD). AFOSI is seeking to establish a contract with a leader in the crime scene supplies industry to provide DoD inestigative agencies with access to purchasing crime scene supplies on-demand through a centralized on-line ordering platform. There are two primary requirements for which solutions are being sought. The first deals with the types of items the government needs to purchase, and the second deals with the ordering, approval, and distribution of items from the vendor.</p>
<p>3. The first requirement is to be able to establish a price scheme for a wide variety of common crime scene supplies and equipment allowing the DoD investigative agencies the ability to standardize the quality of materials we purchase in support of our investigative missions. There are approximately 250 supply items ranging from fingerprint backing cards and tamper resistant tape, to electro-static dust print lifters and metal detectors that will need to be satisfied through this contract. Ideally, this DoD catalogue would be a subset of the vendor's already established supply chain system.</p>
<p>4. The second requirement is that the vendor provide the government with an online<br />marketplace. The marketplace is expected to allow for orders to originate from any one of over 300 DoD locations worldwide, with a delivery address to the ordering location. An administrative user account with the ability to set and control each agency's spending limit(s) is reqiuired. Additionally, it should have the capability of establishing a central approval office within the ordering DoD agency that will approve orders prior to them being placed. Furthermore, the capability to establish separate user accounts for order requests and order approvals for multiple agencies is required. The designated approval agency/account will hold final approval authority to submit orders for delivery to the originating DoD location. Lastly, the central approval office for the appropriate DoD agency will be responsible for reviewing invoices for payment through the marketplace once supplies have been delivered and accepted by the Government. Payment methods may include Wide Area Work Flow (WAWF), GPC, etc.</p>
<p>5. The North American Industry Classification Systems (NAICS) Code identified for this effort is merely a suggestion and is used to meet posting requirements for FedBizOps.Gov ONLY. All interested parties shall provide suggestion(s) for potential NAICS to include supporting rationale.</p>
<p><br />6. This potential requirement will be a competitive acquisition. All interested parties shall submit a capability briefing to include your proposed NAICS code and identify your business size (large or small) in relation to this NAICS code as well as business status. In the event the potential vendor is a small business, the government is interested in businesses certified by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) as an 8(a), Historically Underutilized Business Zone, Small Business, Woman-Owned Small Business or Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses capable of performing work outlined on this sources sought. Small businesses are advised that FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting, would apply wherein at least 50 percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern.</p>
<p>7. Interested parties are requested to submit a statement of capability outlining past work that is related to this requirement as stated in draft PWS. The capability briefing shall include:</p>
<p>a) Company name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and FAX numbers, website address (if available), and the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of a point of contact having the authority and knowledge to clarify responses with Government representatives.</p>
<p>b) Name, title, telephone number, and e-mail addresses of individuals who can verify the demonstrated capabilities identified in the responses.</p>
<p>c) DUNS number, CAGE Code, Tax Identification Number, and company structure (Corporation, LLC, partnership, joint venture, etc.). Companies also must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM, at www.sam.gov) to be considered as<br />potential sources.</p>
<p>d) The capability briefing shall be UNCLASSIFIED.</p>
<p>8. Any information provided by industry to the Government as a result of this sources sought is strictly voluntary. Responses will not be returned. No entitlements to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges to the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses, or the Government's use of such information. The information obtained from industries' responses to this notice may be used in the development of an acquisition strategy and a future RFP (if applicable). The limit for all responses is not to exceed fifteen (15) single-sided, a minimum of 12 font size, a maximum of 8 &frac12; x 11-inch pages. <br />9. All interested parties shall submit a capability briefing via e-mail to Contract Specialist TSgt Sheliah McDaniel at Sheliah.J.McDaniel.Mil@mail.mil and copy Mrs. Ramona Hanson at Ramona.L.Hanson2.Civ@mail.mil. Electronic submissions are required.</p>
<p><br />10. Questions shall be submited on or before 10 April 2014, 2:00 p.m. Easter Time Zone. Responses shall be received not later than 25 April 2014, 3:00 pm Eastern Time Zone.</p>
<p><br />11. E-mail submissions are subject to size and type restrictions (typically limited to less than<br />5 megabyte in size and only non-executable attachments such as .doc or .pdf files) as well as any other appropriate network security measures. It is the respondent's responsibility to verify the e-mail was received and can be viewed. All responses must address each of the above stated requirements.</p>

<DESC>"This is a Small Business Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding: (1) the availability and capability of qualified small business sources; (2) whether they are small businesses; HUBZone small businesses; service-disabled, veteran-owned small businesses; 8(a) small businesses; veteran-owned small businesses; woman-owned small businesses; or small disadvantaged businesses; and (3) their size classification relative to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for the proposed acquisition. Your responses to the information requested will assist the Government in determining the appropriate acquisition method, including whether a small business social-economic set-aside, competitive or non-competitive method is possible, and to determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government's requirement.
<p><br />An organization that is not considered a small business under the applicable NAICS code should not submit a response to this notice."</p>
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The mission of National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes (NINDS) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. This entails bringing novel therapeutics, diagnostics, and other technologies to patients who need them. Despite the use of antithrombotic drugs for the prevention of recurrent strokes, 10% of patients who experience a cerebral ischemic event will go on to have a stroke within 90 days. The development of new treatment strategies for prevention of the various forms of recurrent stroke is an important issue for modern medicine. The principle for the use of E-selectin is the increasing evidence that a state of chronic, subtle immune dysregulation that leads to inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of strokes. Control of such molecular inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation can be achieved by induction of mucosal tolerance. This approach to stroke prevention differs from conventional measures. It will very likely synergize with existing clinical regimens for prevention of stroke and will stimulate a great deal of research in this under-explored area.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: This requirement is for the purchase of service for the creation and production of current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) grade recombinant human E-selectin (rhE-selectin) drug substance using a Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS) in an insect cell platform. Services include the creation, production and maintenance of a cGMP Master Virus Seed Bank, Master Cell Bank and optional Working Cell and Virus Seed Banks. Volume of final product will be enough to support toxicology and two clinical trials</p>
<p>Project requirements: This requirement includes:<br />a) Creation and maintenance of a cGMP Master Virus Seed Bank and possibly an optional Working Virus Seed;<br />b) Creation and maintenance of a Master Cell Bank and optional Working Cell Bank;<br />c) Creation and testing of End of Production Cell Bank<br />d) Creation and maintenance of Reference Standard;<br />e) Manufacturing scale up using proposed or newly optimized manufacturing plan;<br />f) Procurement and receipt all necessary raw materials; maintenance of appropriate inventory control<br />g) Qualification of all critical raw material vendors and any testing sub-contractors<br />h) Production of cGMP grade recombinant E-selectin drug substance using a Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS) in an insect cell platform in amounts to be specified;<br />&bull; The amount of rhE-selectin required will be presented in the final contract. The working estimates are that approximately 100 mg will be required from early batch for rodent model studies, approximately 2,000 mg for toxicology and additional research studies, and approximately 1,000 mg for clinical studies, <br />&bull; Specifically, the 282aa recombinant human E-selectin that (i) contains a secretory signal peptide, which is removed during secretion, (ii) has complete homology to the human E-Selectin sequence except for a signal peptide and the two amino acid residues (Arg-Ser) at the carboxy terminus, which are derived from the translation of linker sequence in the baculovirus expression vector and (iii) any c-myc, histidine or other tag sequences are eliminated. There are significant advantages in recombinant protein quality, productivity, post-translational processing and biological activity, and therefore we expressly require, that the expression be done in insect cells. Molecular mass specifications are the 282 amino acid sequence of the amino terminal of the extra membranous domain of human E-selectin comprised of lectin, epidermal growth factor, and complement regulatory factor repeats beginning with &lsquo;WSYNT...' and ending with &lsquo;....CKAVT'.<br />i) Performance of fill and finish for vialed sterile drug product for use in clinical trials<br />j) Development and qualification of analytical assays to support in process testing, release testing for drug substance, release testing for drug product, stability testing for drug substance and stability testing for drug product;<br />k) Performance of product release and provision of Certificate of Analysis for rhE-selectin DS and DP, using tests and preliminary acceptance criteria specified Table 3 and Table 5;<br />l) Performance of stability testing of drug substance and drug product with assays specified in Table 6;<br />m) Provision of radiolabelled E-selectin, approximately 60-70 mg.<br />n) Provision of experienced staff with to write CMC portions of IND and participate in any required written or verbal interaction with FDA. <br />o) Provide deliverables that include human E-selectin product in a time frame allowing for production and the start of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology and immunotoxicology testing in twelve to fifteen months from time of contract release;<br />p) Capability to develop formulations of recombinant proteins for long-term stability and can perform accelerated and long term stability testing using appropriate assay testing;<br />q) Assure the recombinant E-selectin shall be purified and tested for stability, sterility, purity, identity, strength and potency, and dose concentrations;<br />r) Provide placebo, consisting of formulation without protein;<br />s) Prepare and approve all necessary GMP documentation and maintain a Quality System necessary to support GMP manufacturing.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: The anticipated period of performance 24 months from the date of contract award.</p>
<p>Capability statement /information sought. Interested parties are expected to review this notice to familiarize itself with the requirements of this project. Failure to do so will be at your firm's own risk.</p>

<DESC>This is a Sources Sought notice. This is NOT a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, or quotations. The purpose of this notice is to obtain information regarding the availability and capability of all qualified sources to perform a potential requirement.
<p>This notice is issued to help determine the availability of qualified companies technically capable of meeting the Government requirement and to determine the method of acquisition. It is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation or ultimately award a contract. Responses will not be considered as proposals or quotes. No award will be made as a result of this notice. The Government will NOT be responsible for any costs incurred by the respondents to this notice. This notice is strictly for research and information purposes only.</p>
<p>Background: The mission of National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Strokes (NINDS) is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. This entails bringing novel therapeutics, diagnostics, and other technologies to patients who need them. Despite the use of antithrombotic drugs for the prevention of recurrent strokes, 10% of patients who experience a cerebral ischemic event will go on to have a stroke within 90 days. The development of new treatment strategies for prevention of the various forms of recurrent stroke is an important issue for modern medicine. The principle for the use of E-selectin is the increasing evidence that a state of chronic, subtle immune dysregulation that leads to inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of strokes. Control of such molecular inflammation at the sites of endothelial activation can be achieved by induction of mucosal tolerance. This approach to stroke prevention differs from conventional measures. It will very likely synergize with existing clinical regimens for prevention of stroke and will stimulate a great deal of research in this under-explored area.</p>
<p>Purpose and Objectives: This requirement is for the purchase of service for the creation and production of current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) grade recombinant human E-selectin (rhE-selectin) drug substance using a Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS) in an insect cell platform. Services include the creation, production and maintenance of a cGMP Master Virus Seed Bank, Master Cell Bank and optional Working Cell and Virus Seed Banks. Volume of final product will be enough to support toxicology and two clinical trials</p>
<p>Project requirements: This requirement includes:<br />a) Creation and maintenance of a cGMP Master Virus Seed Bank and possibly an optional Working Virus Seed;<br />b) Creation and maintenance of a Master Cell Bank and optional Working Cell Bank;<br />c) Creation and testing of End of Production Cell Bank<br />d) Creation and maintenance of Reference Standard;<br />e) Manufacturing scale up using proposed or newly optimized manufacturing plan;<br />f) Procurement and receipt all necessary raw materials; maintenance of appropriate inventory control<br />g) Qualification of all critical raw material vendors and any testing sub-contractors<br />h) Production of cGMP grade recombinant E-selectin drug substance using a Baculovirus Expression Vector System (BEVS) in an insect cell platform in amounts to be specified;<br />&bull; The amount of rhE-selectin required will be presented in the final contract. The working estimates are that approximately 100 mg will be required from early batch for rodent model studies, approximately 2,000 mg for toxicology and additional research studies, and approximately 1,000 mg for clinical studies, <br />&bull; Specifically, the 282aa recombinant human E-selectin that (i) contains a secretory signal peptide, which is removed during secretion, (ii) has complete homology to the human E-Selectin sequence except for a signal peptide and the two amino acid residues (Arg-Ser) at the carboxy terminus, which are derived from the translation of linker sequence in the baculovirus expression vector and (iii) any c-myc, histidine or other tag sequences are eliminated. There are significant advantages in recombinant protein quality, productivity, post-translational processing and biological activity, and therefore we expressly require, that the expression be done in insect cells. Molecular mass specifications are the 282 amino acid sequence of the amino terminal of the extra membranous domain of human E-selectin comprised of lectin, epidermal growth factor, and complement regulatory factor repeats beginning with &lsquo;WSYNT...' and ending with &lsquo;....CKAVT'.<br />i) Performance of fill and finish for vialed sterile drug product for use in clinical trials<br />j) Development and qualification of analytical assays to support in process testing, release testing for drug substance, release testing for drug product, stability testing for drug substance and stability testing for drug product;<br />k) Performance of product release and provision of Certificate of Analysis for rhE-selectin DS and DP, using tests and preliminary acceptance criteria specified Table 3 and Table 5;<br />l) Performance of stability testing of drug substance and drug product with assays specified in Table 6;<br />m) Provision of radiolabelled E-selectin, approximately 60-70 mg.<br />n) Provision of experienced staff with to write CMC portions of IND and participate in any required written or verbal interaction with FDA. <br />o) Provide deliverables that include human E-selectin product in a time frame allowing for production and the start of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology and immunotoxicology testing in twelve to fifteen months from time of contract release;<br />p) Capability to develop formulations of recombinant proteins for long-term stability and can perform accelerated and long term stability testing using appropriate assay testing;<br />q) Assure the recombinant E-selectin shall be purified and tested for stability, sterility, purity, identity, strength and potency, and dose concentrations;<br />r) Provide placebo, consisting of formulation without protein;<br />s) Prepare and approve all necessary GMP documentation and maintain a Quality System necessary to support GMP manufacturing.</p>
<p>Anticipated period of performance: The anticipated period of performance 24 months from the date of contract award.</p>

<RESPDATE>041114
<CONTACT>Ashlie N. Evans, Phone 2022608527, Email ashlie.evans@hhs.gov
<DESC><strong>SUMMARY:</strong> ASPR/NHPP promotes research and analysis aimed at further validating fundamental preparedness healthcare capabilities and associated outcomes. This RFI seeks information about the market capability of sources and information in helping ASPR/NHPP create stronger linkages between healthcare coalitions' to daily healthcare delivery-and promote practices that motivate communities to adopt sustainable healthcare preparedness efforts. ASPR recognizes the need to improve the science of healthcare preparedness. In response to this, the mission and scope of NHPP's evaluation branch has taken on a broader mission and a new name-the Science Healthcare Preparedness Evaluation and Research (SHARPER) Branch. NHPP will emphasize a more rigorous, evidence-based, outcome driven approach to healthcare preparedness and response. This enhanced mission and new approach must also be reflected in how NHPP's measurement of healthcare preparedness, for both process and summative outcomes. To accomplish our goal of further improving the nation's ability to prepare, respond, and recover from healthcare emergencies, NHPP intends to restructure how it measures the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) outcomes and describes the impact of the program on overall healthcare preparedness. In particular, NHPP seeks comments about strategies to leverage existing resources and data, as well as, new data sources to better capture, triangulate, and understand demonstrated progress in healthcare preparedness. NHPP will consider alternative approaches that would best achieve these stated goals of the HPP. NHPP is particularly interested in vendors who have successfully improved outcomes, through integrating exercise and training analysis into enhanced grant measurement and capability techniques.
<p>ASPR will use this information collected through this Request for Information notice to better define capabilities in the market place that may result in a future procurement proposal.</p>
<p><strong>DATES:</strong> Submit electronic comments by 4:00 pm Eastern on <strong>Friday, 11 April 2014.</strong></p>
<p><strong>RESPONSE FORMAT:</strong> ASPR/NHPP requests responses to this RFI in the form of a white paper. White papers shall be submitted in Microsoft Word (Times New Roman, 12-point font) and are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>due no later than Friday, 11 April 2014 4:00 p.m. EDT.</strong></span> White papers shall be submitted via email only to the primary point of contact listed below. ASPR will not accept hard-copy responses.</p>
<p>ASPR is requesting that you provide your information in the following format:</p>
<p><strong>Section I.</strong> Name, mailing address, phone number, fax number, and email of designated point of contact.</p>
<p><strong>Section II.</strong> The name and contact information for the business or other organization whose views are represented in the paper, if that contact information differs from that provided in Section I.</p>
<p><strong>Section III (NO MORE THAN 12 PAGES).</strong> Complete and considered responses to each of the questions listed any other information that might be helpful to the Government.</p>
<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> In recent years, ASPR's HPP has evolved from a hospital specific focus to defining a more prominent role for healthcare coalitions in healthcare preparedness. While HPP has learned a lot related to this transition from hospitals to healthcare coalitions, there is a need to be more precise and more informed about the impact and interactions of healthcare coalitions, healthcare preparedness capabilities, and how that relates to the conventional healthcare delivery system. As a result, there is a need to ensure that HPP program measures and evaluation strategies are developed to accurately reflect the evidence and support the current science and applied research in healthcare preparedness, which leverages and better integrates with the daily healthcare system outcomes, so optimal preparedness may be sustained in fiscally constrained periods.</p>
<p>To better meet the HPP mission as well as legislative and GAO requirements and recommendations, there is a need to identify and describe gaps, weaknesses, and alternative approaches for measurement for healthcare preparedness. These include the conduct of evaluation studies to include the establishment of research questions and applied research methods that effectively address the intersection between healthcare preparedness and the daily healthcare delivery system. There is also need to develop new and refine existing performance measures that reflect the mission of HPP and position the division to effectively assess the level of preparedness for coalitions and healthcare organizations.</p>
<p>The responses this RFI generates will help inform ASPR's efforts in the performance measurement process as well as methods for the validation of self-reported data report in performance measures.</p>
<p><strong>QUESTIONS:</strong> This RFI seeks comment from members of the public about how ASPR can best assess program performance through the use of performance measures and other applied research methods that may be used to augment performance measures. The feedback from this RFI may be used to enhance the Government's ability to obtain a quality service. ASPR asks that each respondent address each of the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Describe applied research and/or program evaluation methodologies in your experience that would help the Government assess awardee data from cooperative agreement programs in the area of healthcare system preparedness?</p>
<p>2. Describe new or existing methods to assess data collected from cooperative agreement awardees and determine performance-capability-based outcomes. Describe your experience in conducting these types of evaluations.</p>
<p>3. Describe ways and methods of leveraging and integrating other federal or private sector methodologies and policies into an existing program evaluation framework for a national cooperative agreement program.</p>
<p>4. Are there abilities in the marketplace that can use complex and historical programmatic, performance measurement, and/or exercise and training data to develop new performance measures for a national program?</p>
<p>5. Is there an understanding in the marketplace of the daily (conventional) healthcare delivery system and how it impacts and intersects with overall healthcare preparedness?</p>
<p>6. Based on your experience, are there new or existing ways to enhance the data quality and data analysis of self-reported data? Additionally, are there new or existing methods used to validate self-reported data in order to address processes and summative outcomes for a national program?</p>
<p>7. Describe new or existing strategies to make inferences related to the identification of strengths and weaknesses from real world incidents or events and make recommendations to inform national programs-specifically in the areas of medical and public health response.</p>
<p>8. Identify new or existing methods to develop benchmarks and targets for indicators for the purposes of performance measurement?</p>
<p><br /><strong>SPECIAL NOTE TO RESPONDENTS:</strong> Respondents are asked to draw their responses from objective, empirical, and actionable evidence and to cite this evidence within their responses. ASPR particularly interested in the findings of research in the areas of healthcare preparedness and health services delivery, community resilience, healthcare preparedness, data validation, public policy and/or the administration of complex policy programs, innovation diffusion, and other disciplines that can inform national healthcare preparedness.</p>

<DESC>VA intends to award an Architect/Engineer contract for complete design services (preliminary concepts and layouts, program development, investigative services, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services) to  Upgrade Secondary Electric Service project # 528A7-14-705
This is a 100% total service disabled veteran owned small business set aside. 
This design encompasses the upgrade of the secondary electric service at the Syracuse VA Medical Center.  Design will encompass at least two phases.    A comprehensive electrical master plan has previously been developed which will be supplied to the highest rated firms A/E for this design.  A/E will be expected to use the master plan as a starting point for the conceptual layouts and fully understand the long range plan so as to accommodate those plans into the designs.
Phase #1:  Upgrade and replacement of normal switchgear and substations.  This phase will replace the existing secondary substations and normal power switchgear. In addition this phase will redesign the 480V circuits currently feeding high voltage imaging equipment on ground, 2nd and 3rd floors of building #1.  Removal of step up transformers and associated appurtances in main electric room will address a number of electrical clearance deficiencies and create necessary space in electrical rooms for subsequent phases.  Electric rooms will be reworked requiring some minor architectural design. Substations to be right sized to handle existing and future growth.
All connection points should be outside the main electrical room (e.g. pipe basement), in order to reclaim as much useable space inside the switchgear room as possible.
Phase #2: Replace and upgrade of emergency switchgear, transfer switches and emergency generators.  This phase will also complete the separation of emergency circuits into a code compliant emergency distribution system.  Emergency power system to be right sized to handle existing and future 208V load.
Services shall include, multi-disciplinary investigative services, initial conceptual drawings, attending required design/review meetings, preparation of contract drawings and specifications, cost estimating services, and construction period services which shall include final punch list compilation and as-built drawings. Deliverables being provided to the VA will include initial conceptual drawings, 30%, 60%, 90%, and 100% drawings and specifications for review and approval, and 100% construction documents provided in multiple sized copies. A copy of the space plan will be distributed to the highest ranked top three selected firms. 
The intent is for the design to occur during FY2014 and continue through FY2015 with construction in early FY2016 or FY2017.
The following evaluation factors will be used when reviewing submitted SF 330 data and will comprise the basis of information to be used by VAMC Syracuse for A/E evaluation and selection.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for this requirement is 541380 and the size standard is $14.0 million. Interested persons may identify their interest, in writing, to the Government point of contact. Responses to this notice must be received no later than 12:00 PM, Eastern Standard Time, 10 April 2014.

<DESC><strong>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE</strong>. This is a Special Notice that includes a Request for submission of Statement of Capability (SOC) addressing the capability to provide Oracle Support for Business Systems Modernization-Energy (BSM-E) Enterprise Level System. This Special Notice is issued solely for information and planning purposes - it does not constitute a Request for Quote (RFQ) or Request for Proposal (RFP) or a promise to issue an RFQ or RFP in the future. This SOC does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. The information provided in the SOC is subject to change and is not binding on the Government.
<p>The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) is not at this time seeking proposals and will not accept unsolicited proposals for the work described in the attached documents. Responders are advised that the DLA will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in responding to this SOC.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Request for Statement of Capability</strong></p>
<p><br />The purpose of issuing this Statement of Capabilities (SOC) under SP4706-14-SOC-BSME-DCSOE is to identify potential contractors and assess their capability to provide Information Technology (IT) services to Energy Applications, DLA Information Operations, Defense Logistics Agency, to continue sustainment and provide decommissioning support services for the Business Systems Modernization-Energy (BSM-E) Enterprise Level System. These services include project management, infrastructure and configuration management, product upgrades, application maintenance, Information Assurance (IA) validation of application security controls for the BSM-E Enterprise Level System, 24x7 On-Call Support, Tier 2 helpdesk support, testing, database administration, and decommissioning services to support DLA Energy. The BSM-E Enterprise Level System consists of Oil Enterprise Downstream (OED/OEDA), Reporting Data Store (RDS), Oracle Government Financials (OGF), Discoverer, Redwood Cronacle Enterprise Job Scheduling Software applications and Locally-Developed Products and Extensions that provide additional functionality.<br />The Performance Work Statement entitled: "Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Information Operation Sustainment and Decommissioning Support of the Business System Modernization - Energy (BSM-E) Enterprise Level System" is provided for information and reference in order to facilitate the ability to respond to the SOC response areas detailed below (see attached PWS)</p>
<p>1. Provide a brief narrative discussing your capability to provide Information Technology (IT) services for maintenance of operational capabilities, sustainment and decommissioning for the BSM-E Enterprise Level System based on OED Version 6, a software application used exclusively and solely by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) worldwide within the BSM-E system of systems. The narrative discussion shall address the capability to provide sustainment and decommissioning without OED having the benefit of a product support organization upon which to rely as an informational and training resource; with OED code "wrapping" and inaccessibility which prohibits making changes to the code; the complexity of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System architecture which requires the movement of data between multiple databases based on a proprietary data transfer framework [Replicated File System (RFS), Workgroups, and sequence numbers]; the necessity to create data manipulation scripts to provide work arounds to OED "bugs' and limitations; and maintaining the more than one-thousand Redwood jobs performed in the daily and nightly schedule runs; the ability to analyze, cleanse and migrate OED data and ability to develop an application/database environment retirement strategy and a recovery capability strategy. The narrative shall set forth an implementation plan for sustainment and decommissioning services highlighting and detailing resources, experience, knowledge, certifications, and past performance as it relates to a world-wide enterprise information technology system for commodity management and financial accountability.</p>
<p>2. Provide a brief narrative discussing your capability to provide Information Technology (IT) services for operations, sustainment and decommissioning of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System based on the knowledge, experience and the ability to interpret DOD Policy, Manuals and Instructions; DLA-specific Policy, Manuals and Instructions; DLA Energy Business Rules, processes, procedures and regulations for standard accounting policy and procedures; and the application of these policies while performing efforts which facilitate and support the sustainment and decommissioning of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System. The narrative shall demonstrate possession of the required knowledge and experience, and provide examples of the application of this knowledge and experience via the business accounting and inventory functions as it relates to DLA's system of record for DLA Energy's financial and inventory data. The narrative shall describe and demonstrate the capability to leverage existing legacy and up-to-the-minute subject matter expertise to provide analysis of tables, fields, data elements and financial relationships within the BSME-E Enterprise Data System and for applications interfacing with BSM-E to contractors supporting Energy Convergence. In order to perform this effort, the capability to provide subject matter expertise regarding the BSM-E business processes, DLA standard accounting procedures and financial impacts are necessary. The contractor shall include a discussion on the capability to provide recommendations and alternatives to DLA Energy if specific tables, fields or data elements are not retained for migration and needed after decommissioning in order to maintain DLA Energy's financial policies and the ability to develop an application/database environment retirement strategy, a recovery capability strategy and ability to shut down the applications and perform project close out. The contractor will provide resources at the staffing level assigned within the scope of the contract.</p>
<p>3. Provide a brief narrative discussing your capability to provide Information Technology (IT) services for maintenance of operational capabilities, sustainment and decommissioning of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System based on code that has been locally developed around various COTS applications which are at the "heart" of the BSM-E Enterprise Level System. The narrative discussion shall address the capability to provide maintenance and sustainment of locally developed code that has increased in size and criticality as a result of added functionality which consist of products and extensions listed in Section 3.5 of the PWS. The discussion should include the capability to maintain local code that impacts the COTS application interfaces, reports in the report repository and bug fixes within OED that due to code "wrapping" and inaccessibility require development of processes to support Energy Convergence rollouts by geographical areas and data cleansing activities by DLA Energy. The extensions, consisting of 2.6 million lines of code, contain complex business rules and require the sustainment and maintenance of DLA Energy's business rules. The narrative shall demonstrate a plan for maintenance and support to troubleshoot technical and functional issues, recommendations and alternatives on proposed business processes and/or system defect workarounds, code development and maintenance of existing code that interfaces with OED, development of specifications, development of test documentation and training guides, and maintenance of code required for data migration as a result of decommissioning.</p>
<p>4. Provide responses to the SOC response area detailed above based on the following required formatting:</p>
<p>a. Four pages or less for each question</p>
<p>b. Times New Roman 12 Point Type</p>

<DESC>MARKET SURVEY ANNOUNCEMENT

HUMAN FACTORS R&D SERVICES FOR IMPROVED ROTORCRAFT OPERATIONAL SAFETY

1.  Introduction/Purpose

The FAA has a requirement for human factors research and development (R&D) services.  The requirement is to develop scientific and technical information that will support recommendations for regulatory guidance that are intended to improve rotorcraft operational safety.  

Although no funding has yet been programmed for this area of safety-critical human factors scientific effort, we are planning a significant, multi-year program of research and development to address current and emerging human factors challenges to rotorcraft operational safety.  Initially, there are six identified focus areas for this R&D program to characterize and address human factors issues in rotorcraft technologies and procedures, including:

a.  NVIS (NVG) Operations. Data is needed to address night vision goggle (NVG) single crew operations into unimproved landing zones.  The data will inform decisions for minimum crew and type of operation, including cognitive task and information needs analysis relative to visual cueing with and without NVG, considering no landing zone (LZ) preparation.  A human factors cognitive task analysis and subsequent simulation research would be used to obtain the needed data.  Mandating use of NVG at night in all environments might create human factors safety concerns.  Additional R&D will address these considerations.

b.  Inflight Weather Decision Making. In order to mitigate continued visual flight rules (VFR) flight into instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) during HEMS operations, there is a need for human factors R&D to develop procedures and tools to assist the flight crew in airborne weather assessment and decision making.  This is a priority safety initiative to reduce HEMS controlled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT) and wirestrike events in deteriorating weather.  The R&D goal is to provide authoritative guidance to HEMS crews through decision support and training.  This will mitigate mission pressures to continue VFR flight during adverse weather. The current web-based aviation digital data service (ADDS) HEMS tool addresses preflight planning considerations, but does not mitigate problems related to continuing VFR flight into adverse weather after the mission has launched.  One approach under consideration would ask a joint government (FAA-NASA) and industry team to characterize the flight crew information needs, and then to develop recommendations for follow-on research.  The research would develop and evaluate mitigations including airborne tools (e.g., iPAD applications), displays, operating heuristics, and associated training to reduce the incidence of airborne weather decision making errors.  

c.  Fuel Mismanagement. Fuel mismanagement human factors issues may account for increased accidents. A research assessment of these accidents will identify the nature and scope of the problem and lead to recommendations for research to develop appropriate mitigations.

d.  Runway Safety and Runway Incursion Mitigation. Research is needed to develop guidance for 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 91 and 135 helicopter operators and regulatory oversight personnel. The guidance will implement operating procedures and emphasize pilot actions to maintain awareness during taxi operations, reducing the incidence of runway incursions.  Unique issues are related to rotorcraft operations in the airport environment.  Land pad locations, with or without taxiway access, landing pad safety areas, landing on taxiways, non-standard approaches to landing areas, hover and air taxi operations, and visibility of signage and markings are areas of concern.  In FY12, a Category A runway incursion occurred at White Plains, NY (HPN) due to a rotorcraft, and several Category C events involving rotorcraft have also been reported.  A study of runway incursion event data would identify common causal factors related to rotorcraft operations in and around runway and landing pad safety areas.  Recommendations would be formulated for potential mitigations to lower the risk of rotorcraft runway incursions and accidents.  

e.  Single Pilot Required Navigation Performance (RNP) Operations.  Single pilot helicopters conducting RNP operations may exceed pilot workload (minimum crew / type of operation) and safe operating practices.  A simulation study would provide data that would identify the potential need for operating limitations and mitigations for excessive workload in single pilot RNP operations.

f.  Human Factors Aspects of Improved Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) Airways in Metroplex and Other Congested Areas.  Improved IFR airway structure in specific regions of the National Airspace System is a priority of the Vertical Flight Committee (VFC).  This will improve safety of IFR operations in high density helicopter operations areas, and will separate these operations from other commercial operations in metroplex areas.  The development of improved IFR infrastructure will improve operational safety in EMS and other commercial helicopter operations.  Additionally, this infrastructure will also help to provide separation of helicopter operations from eventual unmanned aircraft operations in these congested areas.  Human factors research will facilitate development of this improved infrastructure.

Note that the focus areas for the R&D program are subject to the needs of the FAAs regulatory policy organizations.  Therefore, the scope and emphasis areas may vary substantially from the time of this announcement until issuance of a formal solicitation and negotiation of an award, expected early in fiscal year 2015.

2. Acquisition Landscape, Strategy, and Size

There is currently no incumbent contractor for this procurement.  The FAA welcomes market survey information from all potential offerors.
 
3. Nature of Competition

The acquisition strategy for the procurement has not been determined at this time.   The FAA may choose to make no award, a single award, or multiple awards, and these could include various types of agreements such as Cooperative Agreements, Other Transaction Agreements, and contract awards, through either an unrestricted competition or a set-aside.  The particular acquisition strategy to be used for the procurement will be chosen depending on the responses to the market survey.

Based on initial funding and technical requirement estimates, we anticipate projects of one year duration, with options for up to three subsequent one-year awards without further competition.  In the past, agreements of this nature have included year-long R&D efforts with award values in the $200,000 to $300,000 range.

4. Notes to Interested Parties

a.  This is not a Screening Information Request or Request for Proposals of any kind;

b.  The FAA is not seeking or accepting unsolicited proposals;

c.  The FAA will not pay for any information received or costs incurred  in preparing the response to the market survey; and

d.  Any costs associated with the market survey submittal is solely at the interested vendors expense

<DESC>Solicitation No. F14PS00379
Region 3, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service intends to sole source a requirement for acoustic telemetry receivers and transmitters to track progression of the Asian Carp in areas of the Upper Mississippi River. The Contractor is VEMCO, Nova Scotia, Canada. This requirement is in collaboration among the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Missouri Department of Conservation, West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, and the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources. These ultrasonic transmitters and coded acoustic receivers will be used for tracking Asian Carp using fixed receivers and mobile tracking devices. Compatibility is a major concern when attempting to share cooperatively gathered information on movements and facilitate sharing of data. Transmitters and receivers, rated at 69 KHz, are currently used. To maintain complete compatibility among agencies, the continuation of 69 KHz for transmitters and receivers are required. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code is 335999, with a business size standard of 500. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. A determination by the Government not to compete this requirement, based on responses, is solely within the discretion of the Government. Please contact Rick Hillard at richard_hillard@fws.gov for any questions.

<DESC>NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD - SOLE SOURCE
<p>Description:<br /><br />The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Vehicle Research Testing Center (VRTC) currently owns MATLAB software licenses and contracts for maintenance. Extension of MATLAB licenses and renewal of maintenance is required. NHTSA/VRTC has been using MATLAB for over 18 years to support vehicle research with modeling, simulation and analysis tools. MATLAB is a highly complex and technical software that performs sophisticated mathematical analysis on both the desktop and server-based computers. Therefore the continued use of MATLAB as the research tool for day-to-day research is absolutely vital and in the Governments best interest.</p>
<p>NHTSA/VRTC intends to negotiate on a sole-source basis, with MathWorks, Inc. of Natick, MA to extend the software licenses and maintenance coverage for a 12 month Base plus the Option to exercise four additional 12-month options through March 2019. The effective date of the order is to be determined.</p>
<p>This sole-source procurement is processed under 41 U.S.C. 253(c)(1) "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Supplies or Services Will Satisfy Agency Requirements."</p>
<p>This notice of intent is not a request for competitive quotes. No solicitation document is available and telephone requests will not be accepted. However, any vendor that believes it can meet these requirements stated above may give written notification to the Contracting Officer within 10 days of the posting date of this announcement. Supporting evidence must be furnished in sufficient detail, to demonstrate the ability to comply with the above requirements. Capability statements may be sent to the Contracting Specialist at Omari.Fennell.ctr@dot.gov and Contracting Officer at Robin.Gates@dot.gov. Responses received will be evaluated however; a determination by the Government not to compete the proposed procurement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.

<a href="mailto:roger.k.batchelor2.civ@mail.com">US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity</a>
<DESC>1.	CONTRACTING ACTIVITY: The contracting activity for this action is the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) in support of the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense (USAMRICD). <br> 2.	DESCRIPTION OF ACTION: This approval is being requested for a firm-fixed price commercial award to Agilent Technologies, Inc., 2850 Centerville RD, Wilmington, DE, 19808-1610. USAMRAA will issue a service award as authorized under Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 13 Simplified Acquisition Procedures.     <br> 3.	DESCRIPTION OF SUPPLIES/SERVICES:  USAMRICD has a requirement for the delivery of preventive maintenance (including software) and remedial repair support services for the Agilent Bravo Liquid Handling Platform. The current Bravo platform, 384ST and 96LT heads, and VWorks software all function properly and are currently being used.  Award will be issued with a 12-month base period and four option year periods.   <br> 4.	AUTHORITY CITED: This procurement is being conducted under the authority of Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 13.106-1(b). <br> 5.	REASONS FOR AUTHORITY CITED:  Agilent is the manufacturer of the Agilent Bravo Liquid Handling Platform.   Agilent field service employees are factory trained and therefore uniquely qualified to repair and maintain the highly complex, multiple, and in some cases proprietary systems that comprise these state of the art instruments. Repairs will be completed using components and repair parts manufactured specifically for Agilent to ensure that the instruments are maintained to factory specifications.  Service performed by someone other than Agilent authorized support would invalidate Agilent warranties. <br> 6.	EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COMPETITION: Not applicable.  No competition will be obtained as Agilent is the only source that can satisfy the Government's requirement. <br> 7.	ACTIONS TO INCREASE COMPETITION:  It is the policy of USAMRAA to promote the use of competitive procedures whenever and wherever possible. Market research with future procurements of this nature will include a search for competitive suppliers that can provide specific products that can meet the Government's minimum requirement.  <br> 8.	MARKET RESEARCH: Field service engineers employed by Agilent are uniquely trained and qualified to service and maintain the platform to factory specifications using manufacture replacement parts and components. This knowledge base and experience cannot be duplicated by other vendors. Market research is continuous. Technical personnel conducted web searches and reviewed vendor specifications for this requirement. Since this research is on-going, other potential vendors were cost prohibitive and would require substantial duplication of effort.   <br> 9.	INTERESTED SOURCES:  Agilent is the only source capable of completing the services as indicated above.  No other sources have expressed interest in this requirement and no other sources are known that can satisfy the Government's requirement. A notice of intent to sole source this action will be posted to FedBizOpps.  Any response to the notice shall be considered prior to issuance of an award, though no responses are expected to be received.  The resultant award planned is W81XWH-14-P-0190 which includes a 12- month base year and four option years.   <br> 10.  OTHER FACTS:  A trade-in value for these instruments is only applicable if the warranty is maintained. The trade-in value is contingent upon the instruments remaining under a service contract with Agilent until they are uninstalled.  The resultant award for this approved document will be W81XWH-14-P-0190, which includes a 12-month base year and four optional service years.

The Corrections Program, established with these funds, exists to help the Government of Mexico (GoM) improve its prison system at the Federal, State, and Municipal level. Mexico's federal penitentiary system has taken great strides in improving its operations in terms of security, but also in conditions of confinement, the treatment of prisoners, professionalization of the officer corps, and supervision of offenders. On the other hand, the Mexican state penitentiary system, despite improvements in a handful of locations, remains one of the most neglected components of public security and is plagued by overcrowding, violence, and corruption.</p>
<p>Purpose: <br />The Corrections Reform Program Coordinator is the lead subject matter expert on corrections in Mexico and will interact on a daily basis with GOM corrections officials and respond to requests for U.S. assistance. The Coordinator will plan, design, develop, implement, monitor, budget, and evaluate the program in coordination with the INL Office of Western Hemisphere Programs (INL/WHP), and in consultation with the INL Office of Criminal Justice Assistance and Partnership (INL/CAP).</p>
<p>In addition, the Coordinator advises on wide-ranging policy and technical corrections matters relative to U.S. contributions and participation in penitentiary development programs. The Coordinator works with the GOM to develop and implement basic and advanced projects to improve the capacity of Mexican federal, state, and municipal corrections services.</p>

<p>Maintain Political Liaison:<br />&bull; Generate support for and actively advance U.S. policy objectives with key Mexican officials.<br />&bull; Work with U.S. Department of Justice and other Law Enforcement Agencies at post, as well as with the U.S. Agency for International Development, to coordinate efforts in the criminal justice sector.</p>
<p>Program Planning, Development, and Execution:<br />&bull; Plan, develop, and execute projects in accordance with US Embassy and US State Department goals and objectives and in close consultation with the Government of Mexico. <br />&bull; Provide strategic planning and process development on all phases of project execution from development though implementation, including planning, scheduling, budgeting, monitoring, and coordination.<br />&bull; Work with Mexican federal, state, and municipal corrections agencies to develop opportunities for U.S. assistance. <br />&bull; Submit training initiatives with US federal, state, and municipal corrections agencies to access training and coordinate opportunities for Mexican federal, state, and municipal corrections programs and their corrections academies.

<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p><br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>
<p>(A) Change the name in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(B) Comply with the requirements of subpart 42.12 of the FAR; and</p>
<p>(C) Agree in writing to the timeline and procedures specified by the responsible Contracting Officer. The Contractor shall provide with the notification sufficient documentation to support he legally changed name.</p>
<p>(ii) If the Contractor fails to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this clause, or fails to perform the agreement at paragraph (c)(1)(i)(C) of this clause, and, in the absence of a properly executed novation or change-of-name agreement, the SAM information that shows the Contractor to be other than the Contractor indicated in the contract will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the electronic funds transfer (EFT) clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>
<p>(ii) If located outside the United States, by contacting the local Dun and Bradstreet office.</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>
<p>"System for Award Management (SAM)" means the primary Government repository for prospective Federal awardee and Federal awardee information and the centralized Government system for certain contracting, grants, and other assistance-related processes. It includes-</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>(2) A statement that the Contractor believes that the levy may result in an inability to perform the contract, including rationale and adequate supporting documentation; and</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

<p>(ix) The provision at FAR 52.212-2, Evaluation - Commercial Items (Jan 1999), applies to this acquisition as follows:</p>
<p>52.212-2 Evaluation-Commercial Items (Jan 1999)<br />(a) The Government will award a contract resulting from this solicitation to the responsible quoter whose quote conforming to the solicitation will be most advantageous to the Government, price and other factors considered.</p>
<p>This is a Best Value Procurement. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers:</p>
<p>1. Technical Approach and Understanding<br />The Government will evaluate the degree to with the Quoter's proposed solution will meet the Government's requirements as described in the Statement of Work (SOW), and the extent to which the Quoter's solution is feasible.<br /><br />2. Past Performance<br />The Government will evaluate the relevance, breadth and quality of the Quoter's recent past performance on similar type of work. The Government will assess the quality of the Quoter's past performance based on the past performance references provided in the Quoter's submission and/or other information obtained from references provided by the Quoter, as well as other relevant past performance information obtained from other sources known to the Government. A Quoter without a record of past performance or for whom information on relevant past performance is not available will be evaluated as neutral.</p>
<p>3. Price (non-rated)</p>
<p>The Technical Approach and Understanding will be accorded more weight than Past Performance. Technical Approach and Understanding and Past Performance, when combined, are significantly more important than price. As the technical quotes become more equal, price becomes more important in making the award determination. In the event that two or more quotes are determined not to have any substantial technical differences, i.e., are technically equivalent, award may be made to the lower priced quote. It should be noted that award may be made to other than the lowest priced quote if the Government determines that a price premium is warranted due to technical merit. The Government may also award to other than the highest technically rated quotation, if the Government determines that a price premium is not warranted.</p>
<p>A written notice of award or acceptance of a quote, mailed or otherwise furnished to the successful quoter within the time for acceptance specified in the offer, shall result in a binding contract without further action by either party. Before the offer's specified expiration time, the Government may accept an offer (or part of an offer), whether or not there are negotiations after its receipt, unless a written notice of withdrawal is received before award.</p>
<p>(x) Quoters shall include a completed copy of the provision at 52.212-3, Offeror Representations and Certifications-Commercial Items, with its offer, or indicate that representations and certifications are available on-line in the Reps &amp; Certs section of their System for Award Management (SAM) record available at https://www.sam.gov.</p>

Failure to provide this information may render an offeror's quote non-responsive and may not be considered for award.<br /><br />A strong history of relevant past performance may be more advantageous to the Government than a less relevant record of favorable performance.

The proper address for AMC level protests is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil <BR> <BR>If you have complaints about this procurement, it is preferable that you first attempt to resolve those concerns with the responsible contracting officer.  However, you can also protest to Headquarters, AMC.  The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for resolution.

Wherever the words "offer", "proposal", "offerors", or similar terms are used in this solicitation, they shall be read to mean "quote", "quotation", "quoter", ?vendor? or similar corresponding term to reflect that this solicitation is a Request for Quotations, not a Request for Proposals or an Invitation for Bids. <BR> <BR>Quotes must be submitted per unit price.

If the lowest priced offer is not technically acceptable, the vendor does not have acceptable or neutral past performance, or both, then the Government will evaluate the second lowest priced quote for technical acceptability and acceptable or neutral past performance.  This method will continue until the lowest priced, technically acceptable quote, by a vendor with acceptable or neutral past performance, is determined.

SECTION C - CONTRACT CLAUSES

C.1  FSS RFQ INTRODUCTORY LANGUAGE
  The terms and conditions of the contractor's FSS contract (including any contract modifications) apply to all Blanket Purchase Agreements (BPA) and task or delivery orders issued under the contract as a result of this RFQ.  When a lower price has been established, or when the delivery terms, FOB terms, or ordering requirements have been modified by the BPA or task/delivery order, those modified terms will apply to all purchases made pursuant to it and take precedence over the FSS contract.  Any unique terms and conditions of a BPA or order issued under the contract that are not a part of the applicable FSS contract will govern.  In the event of an inconsistency between the terms and conditions of a BPA or task/delivery order and the Contractor's FSS terms, other than those identified above, the terms of the FSS contract will take precedence.
C.2  VAAR 852.203-70 COMMERCIAL ADVERTISING (JAN 2008)
  The bidder or offeror agrees that if a contract is awarded to him/her, as a result of this solicitation, he/she will not advertise the award of the contract in his/her commercial advertising in such a manner as to state or imply that the Department of Veterans Affairs endorses a product, project or commercial line of endeavor.
(End of Clause)
C.3  VAAR 852.211-73  BRAND NAME OR EQUAL (JAN 2008)
  (Note: as used in this clause, the term "brand name" includes identification of products by make and model.)
  (a) If items called for by this invitation for bids have been identified in the schedule by a "brand name or equal" description, such identification is intended to be descriptive, but not restrictive, and is to indicate the quality and characteristics of products that will be satisfactory. Bids offering "equal" products (including products of the brand name manufacturer other than the one described by brand name) will be considered for award if such products are clearly identified in the bids and are determined by the Government to meet fully the salient characteristics requirements listed in the invitation.
  (b) Unless the bidder clearly indicates in the bid that the bidder is offering an "equal" product, the bid shall be considered as offering a brand name product referenced in the invitation for bids.
  (c)(1) If the bidder proposes to furnish an "equal" product, the brand name, if any, of the product to be furnished shall be inserted in the space provided in the invitation for bids, or such product shall be otherwise clearly identified in the bid. The evaluation of bids and the determination as to equality of the product offered shall be the responsibility of the Government and will be based on information furnished by the bidder or identified in his/her bid as well as other information reasonably available to the purchasing activity. CAUTION TO BIDDERS. The purchasing activity is not responsible for locating or securing any information that is not identified in the bid and reasonably available to the purchasing activity. Accordingly, to insure that sufficient information is available, the bidder must furnish as a part of his/her bid all descriptive material (such as cuts, illustrations, drawings or other information) necessary for the purchasing activity to:
      (i) Determine whether the product offered meets the salient characteristics requirement of the Invitation for Bids, and
      (ii) Establish exactly what the bidder proposes to furnish and what the Government would be binding itself to purchase by making an award. The information furnished may include specific references to information previously furnished or to information otherwise available to the purchasing activity.
    (2) If the bidder proposes to modify a product so as to make it conform to the requirements of the Invitation for Bids, he/she shall:
      (i) Include in his/her bid a clear description of such proposed modifications, and
      (ii) Clearly mark any descriptive material to show the proposed modifications.
    (3) Modifications proposed after bid opening to make a product conform to a brand name product referenced in the Invitation for Bids will not be considered.

  (b) Electronic payment requests. Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this clause, the contractor shall submit payment requests in electronic form.

  (c) Data transmission. A contractor must ensure that the data transmission method and format are through one of the following:
      (1) VA's Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment System. (See Web site at http://www.fsc.va.gov/einvoice.asp.)
      (2) Any system that conforms to the X12 electronic data interchange (EDI) formats established by the Accredited Standards Center (ASC) and chartered by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The X12 EDI Web site (http://www.x12.org) includes additional information on EDI 810 and 811 formats.
  (d) Invoice requirements. Invoices shall comply with FAR 32.905.
  (e) Exceptions. If, based on one of the circumstances below, the contracting officer directs that payment requests be made by mail, the contractor shall submit payment requests by mail through the United States Postal Service to the designated agency office. Submission of payment requests by mail may be required for:
      (1) Awards made to foreign vendors for work performed outside the United States;
      (2) Classified contracts or purchases when electronic submission and processing of payment requests could compromise the safeguarding of classified or privacy information;
      (3) Contracts awarded by contracting officers in the conduct of emergency operations, such as responses to national emergencies;
      (4) Solicitations or contracts in which the designated agency office is a VA entity other than the VA Financial Services Center in Austin, Texas; or
      (5) Solicitations or contracts in which the VA designated agency office does not have electronic invoicing capability as described above.
(End of Clause)
C.5  VAAR  852.246-70  GUARANTEE (JAN 2008)
    The contractor guarantees the equipment against defective material, workmanship and performance for a period of NLT one (1) year or manufacturer's standard warranty, said guarantee to run from date of acceptance of the equipment by the Government. The contractor agrees to furnish, without cost to the Government, replacement of all parts and material that are found to be defective during the guarantee period. Replacement of material and parts will be furnished to the Government at the point of installation, if installation is within the continental United States, or f.o.b. the continental U.S. port to be designated by the contracting officer if installation is outside of the continental United States. Cost of installation of replacement material and parts shall be borne by the contractor.
(End of Clause)
C.6  VAAR 852.246-71  INSPECTION (JAN 2008)
  Rejected goods will be held subject to contractors order for not more than 15 days, after which the rejected merchandise will be returned to the contractor's address at his/her risk and expense.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>
<p><br />12. This solicitation does not have a Defense Priorities and Allocation System (DPAS) rating.</p>
<p><strong>13. Responses to this solicitation are due&nbsp;April 1, 2014 10:00 am local time, Norfolk, VA.</strong> Please reference the solicitation number on your quote.

(D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Contractor will be required to provide consent for TIN validation to the Government as a part of the SAM registration process; and</p>
<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(2) Prospective contractor-submitted annual representations and certifications in accordance with FAR subpart 4.12; and</p>
<p>(3) Identification of those parties excluded from receiving Federal contracts, certain subcontracts, and certain types of Federal financial and non-financial assistance and benefits.</p>
<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(2) The Contractor shall not change the name or address for EFT payments or manual payments, as appropriate, in the SAM record to reflect an assignee for the purpose of assignment of claims (see FAR subpart 32.8, Assignment of Claims). Assignees shall be separately registered in the SAM. Information provided to the Contractor's SAM record that indicates payments, including those made by EFT, to an ultimate recipient other than that Contractor will be considered to be incorrect information within the meaning of the "Suspension of Payment" paragraph of the EFT clause of this contract.</p>
<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract. The Contractor shall communicate any change to the DUNS number to the Contracting Officer within 30 days after the change, so an appropriate modification can be issued to update the data on the contract. A change in the DUNS number does not necessarily require a novation be accomplished. Dun &amp; Bradstreet may be contacted-</p>
<p>(i) Via the internet at http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform or if the Contractor does not have internet access, it may call Dun and Bradstreet at 1-866-705-5711 if located within the United States; or</p>

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System +4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern.

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see FAR 32.11) for the same parent concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>

<p>MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>

The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

The purpose of this clause is to ensure that the contractor and its subcontractors: (1) Are not biased because of their financial, contractual, organizational, or other interests which relate to the work under this contract, and (2) Do not obtain any unfair competitive advantage over other parties by virtue of their performance of this contract. (b) Scope. The restrictions described herein shall apply to performance or participation by the contractor, its parents, affiliates, divisions and subsidiaries, and successors in interest (hereinafter collectively referred to as ?contractor?) in the activities covered by this clause as a prime contractor, subcontractor, co-sponsor, joint venturer, consultant, or in any similar capacity. For the purpose of this clause, affiliation occurs when a business concern is controlled by or has the power to control another or when a third party has the power to control both. (c) Warrant and Disclosure. The warrant and disclosure requirements of this paragraph apply with full force to both the contractor and all subcontractors. The contractor warrants that, to the best of the contractor's knowledge and belief, there are no relevant facts or circumstances which would give rise to an organizational conflict of interest, as defined in FAR Subpart 9.5, and that the contractor has disclosed all relevant information regarding any actual or potential conflict. The contractor agrees it shall make an immediate and full disclosure, in writing, to the Contracting Officer of any potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or the existence of any facts that may cause a reasonably prudent person to question the contractor's impartiality because of the appearance or existence of bias or an unfair competitive advantage. Such disclosure shall include a description of the actions the contractor has taken or proposes to take in order to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any resulting conflict of interest. <BR> <BR>(d) Remedies. The Contracting Officer may terminate this contract for convenience, in whole or in part, if the Contracting Officer deems such termination necessary to avoid, neutralize or mitigate an actual or apparent organizational conflict of interest. If the contractor fails to disclose facts pertaining to the existence of a potential or actual organizational conflict of interest or misrepresents relevant information to the Contracting Officer, the Government may terminate the contract for default, suspend or debar the contractor from Government contracting, or pursue such other remedies as may be permitted by law or this contract. (e) Subcontracts. The contractor shall include a clause substantially similar to this clause, including paragraphs (f) and (g), in any subcontract or consultant agreement at any tier expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold. The terms ?contract,? ?contractor,? and ?Contracting Officer? shall be appropriately modified to preserve the Government's rights. (f) Prime Contractor Responsibilities. The contractor shall obtain from its subcontractors or consultants the disclosure required in FAR Part 9.507?1, and shall determine in writing whether the interests disclosed present an actual, or significant potential for, an organizational conflict of interest. The contractor shall identify and avoid, neutralize, or mitigate any subcontractor organizational conflict prior to award of the contract to the satisfaction of the Contracting Officer. If the subcontractor's organizational conflict cannot be avoided, neutralized, or mitigated, the contractor must obtain the written approval of the Contracting Officer prior to entering into the subcontract. If the contractor becomes aware of a subcontractor's potential or actual organizational conflict of interest after contract award, the contractor agrees that the Contractor may be required to eliminate the subcontractor from its team, at the contractor's own risk. (g) Waiver. The parties recognize that this clause has potential effects which will survive the performance of this contract and that it is impossible to foresee each circumstance to which it might be applied in the future.

GO: To be technically acceptable, all of the technical requirements as specified in this solicitation are met by the quoter. The technical capability factors are as follows: (1) Authorized Lexis Nexis Reseller: the quoter must provide evidence that it is an authorized Lexis Nexis software reseller. The vendor must provide a Corporate line card that clearly states this information. For verification, the vendor must provide a website where the information is available. The authorized reseller must be able to provide all of the technical requirements that are specified in the RFQ.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.     <br>      <br>   DUE DATES:   <br>      <br>   Initial Offer: 	14 Apr 2014   <br>   Best and Final Offer: 	21 Apr 2014   <br>      <br>   SUMMARY:   <br>      <br>   The Government is requesting an offer to lease a minimum of 2,070 net usable to a maximum of 2,254 gross square feet (gross square feet to include any common area factor) in El Paso, Texas within a delineated area of:  Highway 180 North, I-10 South, Airway Boulevard East and Trowbridge Drive West for a period of five years, with 30-day termination rights for the Government subsequent to the first year, except that the lease shall be subject to the availability of appropriations as stated on the attached sample lease for real property (Enclosure 1). The desired occupancy date is September 30, 2014 or as soon as possible thereafter.   <br>      <br>   Armed Forces Recruiting Facilities are to be located in defined geographical areas that contain businesses and other establishments that are of a compatible nature.

Offeror shall obtain a minimum of one bid (three are preferred) from qualified contractors and an itemized list of construction costs which shall be submitted on the Construction Bid Worksheet (Enclosure 7) or on a similar computer-generated facsimile of this format.  The construction bid shall be subjected to an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) review and all bids shall be studied for accuracy and to ensure a determination of fair market value for the proposed construction services.   <br>      <br>   D. Restoration of tenant improvements installed under the terms of the lease shall be waived by Lessor.   <br>      <br>   E.

Paragraph B9 of this request shows the number of Government-Owned Vehicles (GOV) assigned to this facility.  GOV's will remain overnight at the leased premises.  While the lease cannot specify the number of parking spaces for Privately-Owned Vehicles (POV) , it should be noted that the personnel who will work at this facility normally drive their POV's to work and will use the GOV's during the course of their recruiting duties and will leave their POV's at the facility.  There will be eight (8) personnel permanently assigned at this proposed facility.   <br>      <br>   J. Prior to the final acceptance and execution of the lease by the Government, in accordance with public law, the negotiated lease terms must satisfy an appraisal of fair market value.

By submitting this offer, the Offeror agrees to cooperate with the Realty Specialist by providing information on recent leases on the comparable lease worksheet form (Enclosure 13).  All information provided by Offeror shall be held confidential.   <br>      <br>   K. If, during the term of the lease, the Services may require tenant improvements to their leased space, Lessor shall provide construction services (may be through qualified third party General Contractor).  However, only Realty Specialists of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) have the authority to request alterations or improvements to the leased space.  If the Government pays for the improvements, a Supplemental Agreement (SA) to the lease shall be prepared by the COE Realty Specialist as follows.  The Realty Specialist shall provide the construction specifications for the improvements and the Lessor shall then provide a construction cost estimate, which shall be subjected to an Independent Government Cost Estimate (IGCE) review to ensure that fair market value is achieved. If the estimate satisfies the IGCE review, no other bids are required. The contractor shall then be selected and an SA detailing specifications and cost shall be prepared by the Realty Specialist. Once the SA is signed by the lessor it shall be routed to the Chief of the Fort Worth COE Real Estate Division, or other duly authorized Contracting Officer, for execution.  An executed original copy shall be sent to the Lessor and the Lessor shall then direct the selected contractor to proceed.  Work should never be started before the Lessor receives an executed SA.  When the work is completed and accepted by the Government, the lump sum payment (if applicable) shall be released to the Lessor.     <br>      <br>   ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CONSERVATION - SLAT LEASES (SEP 2010)   <br>      <br>   A.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for reasons of unusual and compelling urgency or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program shall be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>8. NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program. It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum, rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the contracting officer or Ombudsman.<br />Informal forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the cognizant contracting officer. If the contracting officer is unable to satisfy the concerns, the interested party is encouraged to contact the USCG Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process, the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, contracting officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).<br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the contracting officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an independent review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the contracting officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103. If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. This will not preclude re-filing of the protest to meet the requirement. To be timely, protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>
<p>Department of Homeland Security<br />United States Coast Guard (CG-9131)<br />Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests<br />1900 Half Street, SW, Room 11-0602<br />Washington, D. C. 20593-0001<br />FAX: 202.475.3904</p>
<p>9. Questions and quotes shall be emailed to Donald.r.dean@uscg.mil . Contractors are responsible for verifying receipt of quotes.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GENERAL INFORMATION <br /></strong><br /></span>The Request for Proposal (RFP) and all applicable documents for the JBCC Performance Based Remediation (PBR) solicitation have been posted/uploaded onto the FEDBIZOPPS website. <br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Please note the following due dates:</strong> <br /><br /></span>Questions/Comments Due: 2:00 PM CT on 3 March 2014 <br />Proposal Due Date: 2:00 PM CT on 9 April 2014<br /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>DESCRIPTION OF WORK PROPOSED: <br /></strong><br /></span>The 772d Enterprise Sourcing Squadron/Environmental Contracting (772 ESS/PKS) at Joint Base San Antonio (JBSA) Lackland, TX, has been asked to provide environmental services to achieve minimum performance objectives and support progress to Site Closeout through remedial action at JBCC, MA. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. The Period of Performance (POP) will be 120 months from date of award.<br /><br />This requirement is to provide a PBR approach to achieve minimum performance objectives and support progress to Site Closeout involving remedial action efforts at the JBCC, MA. The PBR initiative has an overarching goal to implement remedies as necessary to protect human health and the environment that maximizes the number of SCs or advance sites as close to SC as practicable during the POP in a cost effective manner. It is desirable to the Government that Life-Cycle Costs (LCC) be reduced. If SC with no new institutional controls is not obtainable within the POP of this effort, the Contractor shall outline the Optimization Exit Strategy (OES) that will be implemented to accomplish SC. The Contractor shall perform all necessary environmental remediation activities required to meet the performance objectives identified in the Performance Work Statement. Reference the latest PWS dated 16 January 2014 and attachments posted to FEDBIZOPPS for the latest documents.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL:</strong> <br /><br /></span>The 772 ESS/PKS intends to award a single, Firm Fixed Price (FFP) PBR contract for remedial action efforts at JBCC, MA. Source selection procedures as prescribed in FAR Part 15 and FAR supplements thereto will be followed. The resultant contract is contemplated to be a stand-alone "C" contract with a FFP pricing arrangement. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code for this Acquisition is 562910. <strong>This requirement is being issued as a 100% Small Business Set-Aside.<br /></strong><br /><strong>Notice to Offeror(s)/Supplier(s):</strong> Funds are not presently available for this effort. No award will be made under this solicitation until funds are available. The Government reserves the right to cancel this solicitation, either before or after the closing date for receipt of proposals. In the event the Government cancels this solicitation, the Government has no obligation to reimburse an offeror for any costs. <br /><br />The anticipated award of the resultant contract is in the fourth quarter of FY14. The maximum POP for this contract, if all options are exercised, is 120 months from the date of award.<br /><br />Based on executing the current Air Force environmental restoration strategy, the Air Force's rough order of magnitude (ROM) for this PBR is anticipated to be between $25,000,000 and $32,000,000. Offerors will not automatically be non-compliant if the proposed price exceeds the ROM.<br /><br />Proposals shall be submitted in accordance with the RFP requirements and the date indicated in this announcement. <br /><br />Copies of this solicitation are available by INTERNET ACCESS ONLY. All solicitation documents are posted with this announcement and made available for viewing in FedBizOpps (http://www.fbo.gov). Any amendments to the RFP (if required) will be posted in FedBizOpps. Interested parties are reminded that they are responsible for checking FedBizOpps for new information concerning this requirement.<br /><br />Any communications with the Government from the date of this solicitation through contract award shall be directed in writing to the Procuring Contracting Officer (PCO), Ms. Linda L. Cavazos. Email correspondence shall be sent to Ms. Cavazos with a copy to the contract specialist, Mr. Thomas Steinman. <br /><br /><strong>System for Award Management (SAM) Requirements:</strong> Offerors must be registered in the SAM database. If registration is not complete by the required time, the Contracting Officer will proceed to award to the next otherwise successful registered Offeror. Offerors may obtain information on registration at https://www.acquisition.gov.<br /><br /><strong>Environmental Insurance (EI):</strong> The Air Force is currently NOT proposing to require Cleanup Cost Cap (CCC) or any other type of Environmental Insurance (EI) for this PBR.<br /><br /><strong>Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI):</strong> An organizational conflict of interest may result when factors create an actual or potential conflict of interest on a contract, or where the nature of the work to be performed on the contract creates an actual or potential conflict of interest on a future acquisition. Some restrictions may apply to your firm under the proposed future action. This requirements requires offerors to address OCI issues. In accordance with the parameters set forth in FAR Subpart 9.5, the Contracting Officer must ensure that there are no conflicting roles that might bias a contractor's judgment and must ensure that an OCI does not give rise to an unfair competitive advantage. Performance of past clean-up related work at JBCC may have created an OCI concerning this PBR effort. OCIs may exist in the following three ways.<br /><br />a. Unequal access to information - access to non-public information that gives a contractor an unfair competitive advantage.<br /><br />b. Biased ground rules - when a contractor has in some sense set the ground rules for another procurement action creating the potential that the contractor may have tilted the playing field in the new competition (usually toward its own strengths and away from its weaknesses).<br /><br />c. Impaired objectivity - when the contract requires exercise of judgment and the independence of its judgment may be affected (e.g., when the contractor may be required to evaluate its own work in a way that could be adverse to its economic interests). Please keep in mind OCI or potential OCI issues your firm (including all subsidiaries, legacy companies, teaming partners, and subcontractors) may have with respect to the scope of effort at these sites.<br /><br /><strong>Proprietary Information Shall be Properly Marked by Offerors.</strong> The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safeguarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations and Source Selection Procedures.</p>

<DESC>Q&amp;A:<br /><br /><br />Q.&nbsp; "[We have been]advised that it would be too late to submit a SAR package last month following the release of the RFI, even though we are currently overhauling a very similar actuator..."<br /><br />A.&nbsp;I am not sure as to why your company has been advised that it is "too late" to submit a SAR package. It should never be "too late" to submit a SAR package. A SAR package should be accepted any time one is submitted, regardless of the stage of the acquisition or even if there is an active RFI/RFP/etc. or not. While your company might not obtain qualification before award of this specific requirement, once your company is determined to be a qualified source, your company would be included in the qualified source list for all future acquisitions of this same requirement. Therefore, I highly encourage your company (and any other interested sources) to submit a SAR package. Based upon the acquisition time line, there still seems to be a reasonable amount of time left for review and consideration of a SAR package. Although, please keep in mind that we cannot guarantee your company will receive a response before award. Should your SAR package become approved before award, and your company had submitted an offer BEFORE the RFP closed, the offer could then be considered for award (assuming it was otherwise evaluated as technically acceptable IAW section M of the RFP).<br /><br /><br /><br />Q.&nbsp; I think that all bidders should be aware that we have seen damaged Jack End Fitting Assemblies, PN 4720357-2. (About 20%) This item is not stock listed. Until recently, we were unable to get pricing from the OEM. We now have pricing with a lead time of 45 days. The cost, however, doubles the cost of the repair. Would you consider making this an O&amp;A item?<br /><br /><br />A.&nbsp; The Jack End Fittings are not the type of items that would be considered for "pre-approved" O&amp;A under this contract. Further, the Appendix A document for this contract contains the statement "The Contractor is advised to include the cost of replacing a percentage of re-usable and recoverable components...in their remanufacture cost proposal." A review of the list of materials for this actuator would lead an experienced technician to assume that some percentage of assets would suffer various levels of wear on that specific component part. It is up to the individual offeror to establish what that percentage is, and price the offer accordingly. As such, your firm is advised to include the cost of replacing a percentage of the jack end fittings in your remanufacture cost proposal.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Q.&nbsp; ...when replacing the seal, p/n 300-016 (Figure 10-1, Index 38) which is a mandatory replacement part per Appendix A of the subject solicitation, the grooved pin, p/n 541200H0625B (Figure 10-1, Index 34) must be removed. Once removed, the pin should be discarded and replaced. If this is correct, the pin should be added to the 100% mandatory replacement part list.&nbsp;<br /><br />
<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.5pt; mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family: Calibri">A.&nbsp; The 100% replacement list on the Appendix A is intended to supplement the instructions contained in TO 16A1-5-10-3.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the Appendix A lacks specific information on a particular component, then the instructions contained in the TO shall be followed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The TO states that when the pin is removed during the disassembly process, it should be discarded and replaced with new.</span></p>

<DESC>The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) may issue solicitation W52P1J-14-R-0001 for base operations support and security services at various locations throughout the country of Kuwait at a later date.   <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island will hold a Pre-Solicitation Industry Day at Camp Arifjan, Kuwait on May 10, 2014; time TBD, in conjunction with the Site Visit on May 7-8, 2014. The purpose of the Site Visit coupled with the Industry Day is to promote the early exchange of information between industry and the United States Government (USG) to enhance efficiencies in the execution of the K-BOSSS 2.0 acquisition.  The target audience for Industry Day will be industry representatives who are interested in competing as prime contractors.   <br>  <br> Contractors will have the opportunity to have a 30 minute one-on-one audience with Contracting on May 10, 2014. Contractors may use this time to provide feedback generated from the Site Visit and Draft Request for Proposals.   <br>  <br> Interested parties should submit the attached Intent to Attend K-BOSSS 2.0 Site Visit & Industry Day form and required supporting documentation to USARMY.RIA.acc.mbx.kbosss2@mail.mil, no later than April 14, 2014. Please reference K-BOSSS 2.0 Site Visit in the subject of your e-mail. <br>  <br> The proceedings will be consistent with the Procurement Integrity Act.  All questions generated from the Site Visit and Industry Day shall be submitted in English to USARMY.RIA.acc.mbx.kbosss2@mail.mil no later than May 15, 2014, at 0800, CDT. Following the Industry day, the USG will publish all questions and answers to industry via an ASFI/FBO announcement. <br>  <br> This announcement neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the USG to an ultimate acquisition approach. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the USG for any purpose.  <br>  <br> ORIGINAL NOTICE:  <br>  <br> The Army Contracting Command - Rock Island (ACC-RI) may issue solicitation W52P1J-14-R-0001 for base operations support and security services at various locations throughout the country of Kuwait at a later date.   <br>    <br>  This is an announcement for a site-visit that will be held in Kuwait on May 7-8, 2014.  ACC-RI will host a tour of the various camp locations throughout the state of Kuwait.  This site-visit is to familiarize companies with the requirements and physical locations of performance for services that will be performed under the future Kuwait Base Operations & Security Support Services 2.0 (K-BOSSS 2.0) contract.  A draft of the Performance Work Statement (PWS) will be forthcoming.   <br>    <br>  Previously, a sources sought announcement was issued on September 26, 2013, under solicitation number W52P1J-14-R-KBOS, seeking interest from industry prior to release of a potential solicitation.   <br>    <br>  ACC-RI intends to conduct a full and open, best value competition to award a single-Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF) contract with non-fee bearing Cost Reimbursable Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) and an overall Award Fee Plan. The Period of Performance is anticipated to be one base year plus four one year evaluated option periods. It is estimated that a Request for Proposal will be issued September 29, 2014.  However, this date is subject to change.  Future notices will provide updates of the anticipated solicitation release date.  <br>    <br>  The successful offeror for this acquisition will be required to support the Area Support Group - Kuwait (ASG-KU) for those interconnected base operations support services that are critical to mission accomplishment, and cannot be efficiently acquired independently via separate competitive acquisitions.  This requirement supports all USG Army installations in the State of Kuwait, including but not limited to:  Camp Arifjan, Camp Buehring, Udairi Range Complex, Camp Patriot on the Kuwait Naval Base (KNB), the Aerial Port of Debarkation (APOD) located at the Kuwait City International Airport (KCIA)), and Sea Port of Debarkation (SPOD) located at the Kuwait Port of Shuaiba, and other locations in support of the DCA between the governments of the State of Kuwait and the USG.  The Contractor will be required to successfully integrate and execute the following services in support of a USG presence in the region: Logistics; Engineering Services; Installation Support Services (Morale Welfare and Recreation (MWR)); Information Management; Administrative Publications and Forms and Copiers; Postal Operations; Support Services for Medical Office; Operations; Security, Fire and Emergency Services; and, Safety.      <br>    <br>  It should be noted that any interested parties considering responding to a future solicitation for these requirements must be able to demonstrate the existence of a current U.S. facility clearance to the SECRET level IAW DODD 5220.22, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual.  This SECRET level clearance may also apply to affiliates, team members, and subcontractors if they have access to classified information.  At the time a future solicitation is issued, all respondents will be required to submit Facility Clearances for all entities who will be handling classified information (to include, but not limited to: subcontractors, teaming, and any joint ventures) in accordance with the directions delineated in said solicitation document.  <br>    <br>  The maximum number of site-visit representatives from each interested organization is three.  Transportation and security will be provided by the Government while conducting tours of each location as well as to and from the tour sites and the Hilton Kuwait Resort.  For security reasons, all participants must use the Government provided transportation.  (NOTE: Although this is the location for pickup and drop-off for site-visit participants, lodging is at the discretion and choice of each party.)   All parties are responsible for transportation to and from the country of Kuwait, entry into Kuwait (securing visa), transportation to and from Kuwait City International Airport (KCIA) and their choice of lodging.    <br>  Interested parties should submit the attached Intent to Attend K-BOSSS 2.0 Site Visit form and required supporting documentation to USARMY.RIA.acc.mbx.kbosss2@mail.mil, no later than April 14, 2014. Please reference K-BOSSS 2.0 Site Visit in the subject of your e-mail.  <br>    <br>  Access to the secure USG facilities is restricted. Information submitted on this form will be used for installation access to secure facilities during the site visit. Failure to submit the Intent to Attend K-BOSSS 2.0 Site Visit form and required supporting documentation will result in forfeiture of the right to attend this site visit. Attendees will be required to present two forms of state-issued identification upon arrival to secure locations.  <br>    <br>  This site-visit announcement neither constitutes a Request for Proposal or Invitation for Bid, nor does it restrict the Government to an ultimate acquisition approach. This announcement should not be construed as a commitment by the Government for any purpose.   <br>

<DESC>The Multifunction Electronic Warfare (MFEW) system will be a systems of systems that provides electronic attack (EA) and electronic warfare support (ES) capability to the Brigade Combat Team, including aerial, mounted, dismounted, and fixed site variants. It is anticipated that MFEW will have a Milestone B decision sometime in FY17. Before that Milestone B decision, PdM CREW is developing the Architecture for MFEW. MFEW will adhere to the Modular Open System Architecture concept. The Architecture will allow easy upgradability of hardware and software, maximize commonality of components between variants and allow scalability to increase or decrease capability depending on the variant size. Periodically, PdM CREW will release RFIs to industry of Draft Architectures in order to keep industry informed and solicit comments for inclusion into the architecture. This is the first release of the Functional Architecture for MFEW. Please provide comments to the MFEW Functional Architecture, Architectures you have used in the past and other comments by to:   <br>    <br>  Steve Abbott   <br>  Steve.abbott@us.army.mil   <br>  443-987-8494   <br>    <br>  All comments are due by 24 April 2014.   <br>    <br>  The RFI shall not be considered as a Request For Proposal (RFP) or as an   <br>  obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any services, hardware,   <br>  or material. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only.   <br>  No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by or to   <br>  the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission of responses   <br>  to this announcement or the Government use of such information.

Reagan Test Site is a U.S. Army Test and Evaluation (T&E) range located at Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of Marshall Islands.  One of the missions of RTS is to conduct T&E of long range missile systems.  Ensuring public safety is an important aspect of the mission planning and execution of missile tests.  As missile capabilities and ranges have increased it has been more difficult to develop test scenarios that both meet mission test objectives and ensure public safety.  This has resulted in an increased dependence upon flight safety analysis and probabilistic risk modeling as part of the mission planning process.  <br>    <br>  USAKA/RTS has a continuing need for Range Safety Analysis as a part of the risk management and mission planning/preparation processes performed for missions conducted at RTS.  The requirement also includes systems engineering support to assist the Government in performing Improvement and Modernization, mission test planning, execution and program management activities.     <br>    <br>  Tasking may be provided to perform any of the following requirements:    <br>    <br>   	Flight Safety Analysis Support  <br>   	Ground Safety Support, Modeling  <br>   	Modeling, Simulation and Mission Planning Tools Development  <br>   	General Technical Support  <br>     <br>    <br>  CAPABILITY:  <br>    <br>  It is the Government's intent to perform this acquisition as a total small business set-aside.

The intent is to provide input to help industry focus their R&D programs (without any financial reimbursement) toward existing and future Army capabilities, which will benefit both industry and the U.S. Army.    <br>    <br>  This is a Request for Information in accordance with FAR 15.201(b).  THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION.  RFIs are used to gather information from industry without any promise of a current or future contract or requirement.  The ARCIC will use the responses to this RFI to determine what emerging technologies may be available in the market place.  This is not a solicitation for bids or offers.  Information provided cannot be used to create a binding contract.  Respondents to this RFI will not be reimbursed for the information they provide to the ARCIC.  This is a RFI from companies already conducting independent research and development in relevant areas, not a request for companies that may be able to conduct research.  Only those companies with demonstrated success at addressing Department of Defense warfighting capabilities in their independent R&D programs are requested to respond.   <br>    <br>  The ARCIC TIE focus is on supporting our Army's Soldiers and the small unit formation, while maintaining the capacity to deter and defeat potential adversaries by:  1) identifying achievable requirements; applying best practices in acquisition and sustainment; seeking incremental improvements; and harnessing network-enabled capabilities to solve near-term capability gaps; while 2) investing in military-unique revolutionary and evolutionary technologies to solve future capability gaps.  The Army will emphasize long range planning to define future decision points that consider equipment age, degradation of overmatch abilities, industrial base viability and closure of capability gaps in the near term (FYs 14-18), mid-term (FYs 19-27), and long term (FYs 28-48) time frames, while allowing for cost-informed decisions that balance force generation needs with the Total Force modernization posture.   A detailed description of the Army Warfighter Outcomes is available on the Defense Innovation Marketplace  website at the following URL:  (http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/resources/FY13_WFOs_vF.pdf)   <br>    <br>  The Army Warfighter Outcomes should be used when responding to this RFI to help focus TIE discussion topics.  When responding, please provide the following:  a brief description and depth of the company independent R&D program; a one-page summary of past R&D success satisfying DOD capability needs; a one-to-two page description of each of the R&D programs/projects that apply directly to WFOs; and, points of contact for further coordination if necessary.  Contact the TIE Coordinator listed below, who will provide format for topic white paper/point paper.    <br>    <br>  Based on the information provided, your company may be selected to participate in an ARCIC-hosted TIE sessions for addressing specific issues within your independent R&D program.    <br>    <br>  IMPORTANT INFORMATION:  Forward responses to: Mr. Hamilton, TIE Coordinator. Address: TRADOC ARCIC Science & Technology Division (ATFC-ET) Concept Development and Learning Directorate, 950 Jefferson Ave, Joint Base Langley-Eustis, VA 23604-5763, Telephone: (757) 501-5528 Email: kenneth.hamilton4@us.army.mil or kenneth.d.hamilton.civ@mail.mil.   <br>    <br>  COMPANIES SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER PLACING PROPRIETARY TOPIC INFORMATION FOR ARCIC AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES to review and consider at http://www.defenseinnovationmarketplace.mil/.

<DESC>INTENT TO AWARD A SOLE SOURCE ORDER
<p>The U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) intends to award a sole source order to McGraw Hill for Residential Housing Pipeline Database Subscription.

According to preliminary market research conducted, McGraw Hill is the sole provider of a subscription to a database that contains the most complete data and tools for analyzing the multi-family&nbsp;housing market nationwide. These data and research products will be used by HUD's field economists in the Economic and Market Analysis Division in their ongoing studies of local housing market conditions by providing much needed market data, particularly relating to residential housing construction information.</p>
<p>This is a unique online tool that allows the user access to various housing related data, pipeline analytics and pipeline residential data by geographic area throughout the country. The multi-family data included is at a level of coverage that provides a number of variables in many market areas for analysts to access and study. The online nature of the database will allow HUD's field economists to access the data they need for specific geographic areas across the country when they need it. In addition to providing housing related pipeline data, the subscription also provides data analytics, pipeline residential data, and data by Metropolitan Statistical Areas.</p>

<p>This is a Request for Information (RFI) to determine industry interest in a proposed solicitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not a request for proposals.</p>
<p>Background: The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) plans to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) in the near term, for a firm fixed-price contract to dismantle the USS AVENGER (MCM 1) after its decommissioning in San Diego, CA on 30 September 2014, with an option in Fiscal Year 2015 for the dismantling of USS DEFENDER (MCM 2) upon being decommissioned on 01 October 2014.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Both hulls will be stripped of re-usable equipment prior to decommissioning to support the remaining AVENGER Class vessels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A small portion of the equipment removal work for heavy items requiring commercial/industrial handling, packaging and shipping capabilities will be part of the proposed dismantling contract. The Contractor will be responsible for accepting custody of the vessel(s) in San Diego upon their decommissioning and move them to a facility to accomplish the equipment removal and dismantling work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The process for removing equipment and dismantling the vessel(s) must include the capability of removing them from the water in a safe, environmentally-compliant manner, thus all methods will be considered reasonable if the approach is described in a way that can be evaluated for technical acceptability. The Contractor will be responsible for the proper disposal of the wood hull, other solid and liquid wastes and any hazardous materials and/or wastes generated. The contractor will assume title to all scrap materials including anything able to <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>be salvaged (sold) <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>as a scrap commodity in a fully dismantled, non-reusable form.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If the option is exercised for dismantling of USS DEFENDER, the circumstances and scope of work will be the same as USS AVENGER, and the Contractor would be expected to affect removal of the vessel(s) within 15 calendar days from date of award of the base contract and the option for second vessel.</p>
<p>Description:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The vessel USS AVENGER (MCM 1) is an AVENGER Class Mine Countermeasures vessel constructed between 1983 (keel laid) and 1987 (delivered). The principal characteristics of the vessel are length overall 224 feet, extreme beam 39 feet, maximum draft 15 feet, light ship displacement of 1,253 tons, and is constructed of chemically-treated wood except for propulsion engines and auxiliary equipment. The vessel is scheduled to be decommissioned on September 30, 2014 in San Diego, CA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The vessel USS DEFENDER (MCM 2) is an AVENGER Class Mine Countermeasure Ship, constructed between 1983 (keel laid) and 1989 (delivered).

These projects are to demonstrate the value of integrated design that balances historic significance with current needs; balances aesthetics, cost, constructability, and reliability; and creates environmentally responsible and superior workplaces for civilian Federal employees.</p>
<p>In this context, GSA announces an opportunity for performance of Architect-Engineering Design Services in accordance with GSA quality standards and requirements. As required by law, all facilities will meet Federal energy targets and security requirements.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Project Description:</strong></span> <br />The Ron De Lugo Federal Building and U. S. Courthouse is a three story building constructed in 1975, is approximately 93,000 gross square feet and occupies a prominent harbor site in Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. The building is occupied by the United States Virgin Islands District Courts and other government agencies.</p>
<p>Architect-Engineering Design services are needed for the Capital Security Enhancement project at the Ron De Lugo Federal Building and U. S. Courthouse located at 5500 Veterans Drive Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, United States Virgin Islands which involves design of judges parking garages, U. S. Marshal's vehicle sally port, new elevators, and renovation and reconfiguration of the building's interior layout to separate judges' and U.S Marshal's prisoner circulation from public circulation. This anticipated procurement will also improve site security and incorporate redesign of some electrical and/or mechanical equipment associated with the building re-configuration. The design must comply with the Guiding Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance and Sustainable Buildings. <br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Scope of Work:</span></strong> <br />The scope of professional services will require at a minimum: professional architectural, structural engineering, mechanical and electrical engineering, and security design services for concept design documents, design development documents, construction documents, specifications, phased construction plan services, and computer aided design and drafting (CADD).</p>
<p>The project is to include content to comply with the GSA Design Standards, U.S. Courts Design Guide, U.S. Marshals Requirements and Specifications for Special Purpose and Support Space Manual, conformance to the GSA P-100 (Facility Standards for Public Buildings), conformance to federal statutes and regulations to include waste reduction, use of recovered materials, energy conservation, the Buy American Act, and the Competition in Contracting Act.<br />The selected A-E firm will be required to perform all necessary building survey work for this project, such as verifying existing conditions, prepare drawings and specifications in sufficient detail such that qualified construction firms can prepare accurate and timely proposals for the desired construction work. Microsoft Project scheduling and management software will be used by both the A&amp;E and Contractors to allow for regular tracking of schedules and work by the GSA. All work must be designed within a specified construction budget limit, within the range of $10,000,000 - $20,000,000. Progressive design phases are as follows: Pre-Design Survey/Concepts Phase, Final Concept Phase, Design Development Phase, Construction Documents Phase (consisting of: 50% Construction Documents Submission, 95% Construction Documents Submission, 100% Construction Documents Submission, and Final Construction Documents Submission). Additional optional work included in the scope is services for: Design Concept Partnering Session, Construction Procurement Phase, Construction Delivery Phase, and Closeout Phase.<br /><br /><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Selection Process:</span></strong> <br />This is a Request for Technical Proposals (RFP) from A/E Firms. The A/E Firm as used in this RFP means an individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity permitted by law to practice the profession of architecture or engineering that will have contractual responsibility for the project design. The procurement will be evaluated using the Brooks Act. This acquisition is set aside for small businesses. The NAICS code for this procurement is 541310, and the size standard is $7 million.</p>

<p>All SF 330's must be current reflecting a date not more than one year from the date of this notice.</p>
<p>All responsive offers will be evaluated by The Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), consisting of a private section peer and representatives of the client and GSA. After the technical proposals are evaluated and any necessary clarifications are obtained, a competitive range (of the highest technically rated firms) will be established and all offerors outside the competitive range will be notified that their offers have been eliminated from further consideration. Interviews will be conducted with all offerors in the competitive range by the SSEB. The most highly technically qualified A-E firm will be asked to submit a price proposal. Negotiations will be conducted with this A-E firm, if necessary.</p>
<p>In the event that GSA is unable, for any reason, to enter into an agreement with the selected A-E firm, GSA reserves the right to terminate discussion with that A-E firm without incurring any liability. GSA will then proceed to negotiate with the next highest ranked A-E Firm.</p>

<AWARDEE>CasePro, Inc
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award sole source bridge contracts, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): Only one responsible source or only a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of services will satisfy the needs of the agency to:<br />- CasePro, Inc., 21738 Hardy Oak Blvd 105, San Antonio, TX 78258-4984<br />- Catalyst Professional Services Inc., 1490 Garden of the Gods Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80907<br />- Cherokee Medical Services, RR 3, Box 498 Stilwell, OK 74960<br />- Chesapeake Educational Services, LLC, 1934 Old Gallows Rd Ste 350, Vienna, VA, 22182-4050<br />- OMV Medical Inc., 6940 Carroll Avenue Takoma Park, MD 20912-4432<br />- Professional Performance Development Group, Inc., 5441 Babcock Road 200, San Antonio, TX 78240-3989<br />- Saratoga Medical Center, Inc., 11094-D Lee Hwy Ste 103 Fairfax, VA 22030-5014<br />- TCMP Staffing Services LLC, 6551 Loisdale Ct. Ste 500, Springfield, VA, 22150-1821
<p>as the only responsible sources that can provide the existing Physician, Allied Health, Advanced Practice Nurse, Nurse, Technologist, Technician and Assistant services in support of the Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL; Naval Health Clinic Pensacola, FL; Naval Health Clinic Corpus Christi, TX and their affiliated clinics within Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. This action will result in eight firm-fixed price contracts with an ordering period of nine (9) months beginning 04 May 2014. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 622110, a Small Business Size Standard of $35.5 million.</p>
<p>CasePro, Inc. Catalyst Professional Services Inc., Cherokee Medical Services, Chesapeake Educational Services, LLC, OMV Medical Inc., Professional Performance Development Group, Inc., Saratoga Medical Center, Inc., and TCMP Staffing Services LLC have the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain services currently performed under contracts N62645-09-D-5000, N62645-09-D-5001, N62645-09-D-5002, N62645-09-D-5003, N62645-09-D-5004, N62645-09-D-5005, N62645-09-D-5006 and N62645-09-D-5007, respectively. No sources other than the incumbents can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a follow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. For the reasons noted above, NMCL intends to award sole source bridge contracts to ensure that Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL; Naval Health Clinic Pensacola, FL; Naval Health Clinic Corpus Christi, TX and their affiliated clinics within Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas are able to maintain their mission without any lapse in service while the competitive process for the follow-on acquisition is completed.</p>
<p>This Notice of Intent to Award sole source contracts is not a request for competitive proposals. No contracts will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. There is no solicitation document. No Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available for competitive proposals. Phone calls will not be accepted. The point of contact for this action is Kerry McKean (Contract Specialist, NMLC). Ms. Kerry McKean can be reached at kerry.mckean@med.navy.mil.</p>
<p>Please note, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be posted within 14 days of award.</p>

<AWARDEE>TCMP Staffing Services LLC
<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award sole source bridge contracts, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): Only one responsible source or only a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of services will satisfy the needs of the agency to:<br />- CasePro, Inc., 21738 Hardy Oak Blvd 105, San Antonio, TX 78258-4984<br />- Catalyst Professional Services Inc., 1490 Garden of the Gods Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80907<br />- Cherokee Medical Services, RR 3, Box 498 Stilwell, OK 74960<br />- Chesapeake Educational Services, LLC, 1934 Old Gallows Rd Ste 350, Vienna, VA, 22182-4050<br />- OMV Medical Inc., 6940 Carroll Avenue Takoma Park, MD 20912-4432<br />- Professional Performance Development Group, Inc., 5441 Babcock Road 200, San Antonio, TX 78240-3989<br />- Saratoga Medical Center, Inc., 11094-D Lee Hwy Ste 103 Fairfax, VA 22030-5014<br />- TCMP Staffing Services LLC, 6551 Loisdale Ct. Ste 500, Springfield, VA, 22150-1821 <br />as the only responsible sources that can provide the existing Physician, Allied Health, Advanced Practice Nurse, Nurse, Technologist, Technician and Assistant services in support of the Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL; Naval Health Clinic Pensacola, FL; Naval Health Clinic Corpus Christi, TX and their affiliated clinics within Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. This action will result in eight firm-fixed price contracts with an ordering period of nine (9) months beginning 04 May 2014. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 622110, a Small Business Size Standard of $35.5 million.<br />CasePro, Inc. Catalyst Professional Services Inc., Cherokee Medical Services, Chesapeake Educational Services, LLC, OMV Medical Inc., Professional Performance Development Group, Inc., Saratoga Medical Center, Inc., and TCMP Staffing Services LLC have the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain services currently performed under contracts N62645-09-D-5000, N62645-09-D-5001, N62645-09-D-5002, N62645-09-D-5003, N62645-09-D-5004, N62645-09-D-5005, N62645-09-D-5006 and N62645-09-D-5007, respectively. No sources other than the incumbents can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a follow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. For the reasons noted above, NMCL intends to award sole source bridge contracts to ensure that Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL; Naval Health Clinic Pensacola, FL; Naval Health Clinic Corpus Christi, TX and their affiliated clinics within Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas are able to maintain their mission without any lapse in service while the competitive process for the follow-on acquisition is completed.<br />This Notice of Intent to Award sole source contracts is not a request for competitive proposals. No contracts will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. There is no solicitation document. No Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available for competitive proposals. Phone calls will not be accepted. The point of contact for this action is Kerry McKean (Contract Specialist, NMLC). Ms. Kerry McKean can be reached at kerry.mckean@med.navy.mil.<br />Please note, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be posted within 14 days of award.<br />

<AWARDEE>Arrays at Commercial Timescales Technical Area 2 (ACT TA2), 7755 E MARGINAL WAY S., SEATTLE, WA 98108 US
<DESC><p>In BAA-13-26 DARPA solicited innovative research and development (R&amp;D) proposals to create electromagnetic interface arrays capable of being fielded at timescales paced by rapidly advancing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components, i.e., Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT). Today's electromagnetic systems increasingly use antenna arrays to provide unique capabilities, such as multiple beam forming and electronic steering, that are important for a wide variety of applications, e.g., communications, signal intelligence (SIGINT), radar, and electronic warfare. However, the widespread use of arrays has come at a severe cost in terms of the system development time and the ability to upgrade capabilities in the field. While the commercial market has set the pace of the evolution of electronic systems, the development of military electronics has a cadence that lags behind the design and fielding cycles of commercial equipment. For example, a fielded military system based on decade-old electronics (e.g., a Xilinx Virtex 2 FPGA) has a small fraction of the capabilities of a system based on 2012 components (e.g., a Xilinx Virtex 7). In particular, the performance gap is widening between the RF capabilities of a fielded military system and the continuously improving digital electronics surrounding the system. A system with static RF or analog features cannot leverage the advancements of the underlying digital electronics and, therefore, will exhibit fixed capability in an evolving threat space.

<AWARDEE>The Boeing Company, 7755 E MARGINAL WAY S.
, SEATTLE, WA 98108 US
<DESC><p>In BAA-13-26 DARPA solicited innovative research and development (R&amp;D) proposals to create electromagnetic interface arrays capable of being fielded at timescales paced by rapidly advancing commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) electronic components, i.e., Arrays at Commercial Timescales (ACT). Today's electromagnetic systems increasingly use antenna arrays to provide unique capabilities, such as multiple beam forming and electronic steering, that are important for a wide variety of applications, e.g., communications, signal intelligence (SIGINT), radar, and electronic warfare. However, the widespread use of arrays has come at a severe cost in terms of the system development time and the ability to upgrade capabilities in the field. While the commercial market has set the pace of the evolution of electronic systems, the development of military electronics has a cadence that lags behind the design and fielding cycles of commercial equipment. For example, a fielded military system based on decade-old electronics (e.g., a Xilinx Virtex 2 FPGA) has a small fraction of the capabilities of a system based on 2012 components (e.g., a Xilinx Virtex 7). In particular, the performance gap is widening between the RF capabilities of a fielded military system and the continuously improving digital electronics surrounding the system. A system with static RF or analog features cannot leverage the advancements of the underlying digital electronics and, therefore, will exhibit fixed capability in an evolving threat space. It is imperative to define a path toward shorter design cycles and infield updates. Research must push past the traditional barriers that lead to 10-year array development cycles, 20- to 30-year static life cycles, and costly service life extension programs.</p>
<p>Array programs within the government tend to constitute a unique (i.e., highly targeted one-off) design effort with little consideration for design re-use. ACT will develop a separable building block asset in which as much as 70% to 80% of an array's development cycle cost is built-in.</p>

<DESC>The Naval Medical Logistics Command (NMLC) intends to award sole source bridge contracts, under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1): Only one responsible source or only a limited number of responsible sources and no other type of services will satisfy the needs of the agency to:<br />- CasePro, Inc., 21738 Hardy Oak Blvd 105, San Antonio, TX 78258-4984<br />- Catalyst Professional Services Inc., 1490 Garden of the Gods Road, Colorado Springs, CO 80907<br />- Cherokee Medical Services, RR 3, Box 498 Stilwell, OK 74960<br />- Chesapeake Educational Services, LLC, 1934 Old Gallows Rd Ste 350, Vienna, VA, 22182-4050<br />- OMV Medical Inc., 6940 Carroll Avenue Takoma Park, MD 20912-4432<br />- Professional Performance Development Group, Inc., 5441 Babcock Road 200, San Antonio, TX 78240-3989<br />- Saratoga Medical Center, Inc., 11094-D Lee Hwy Ste 103 Fairfax, VA 22030-5014<br />- TCMP Staffing Services LLC, 6551 Loisdale Ct. Ste 500, Springfield, VA, 22150-1821 <br />as the only responsible sources that can provide the existing Physician, Allied Health, Advanced Practice Nurse, Nurse, Technologist, Technician and Assistant services in support of the Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL; Naval Health Clinic Pensacola, FL; Naval Health Clinic Corpus Christi, TX and their affiliated clinics within Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. This action will result in eight firm-fixed price contracts with an ordering period of nine (9) months beginning 04 May 2014. The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code for this requirement is 622110, a Small Business Size Standard of $35.5 million.<br />CasePro, Inc. Catalyst Professional Services Inc., Cherokee Medical Services, Chesapeake Educational Services, LLC, OMV Medical Inc., Professional Performance Development Group, Inc., Saratoga Medical Center, Inc., and TCMP Staffing Services LLC have the necessary knowledge, experience, and staff to maintain services currently performed under contracts N62645-09-D-5000, N62645-09-D-5001, N62645-09-D-5002, N62645-09-D-5003, N62645-09-D-5004, N62645-09-D-5005, N62645-09-D-5006 and N62645-09-D-5007, respectively. No sources other than the incumbents can satisfy this short-term need given the transition period that would be required, and conducting a follow-on acquisition for this need would result in unacceptable delays in fulfilling the agency's requirements. For the reasons noted above, NMCL intends to award sole source bridge contracts to ensure that Naval Hospital Jacksonville, FL; Naval Health Clinic Pensacola, FL; Naval Health Clinic Corpus Christi, TX and their affiliated clinics within Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas are able to maintain their mission without any lapse in service while the competitive process for the follow-on acquisition is completed.<br />This Notice of Intent to Award sole source contracts is not a request for competitive proposals. No contracts will be awarded on the basis of responses received to this notice. There is no solicitation document. No Request for Proposal (RFP) will be available for competitive proposals. Phone calls will not be accepted. The point of contact for this action is Kerry McKean (Contract Specialist, NMLC). Ms. Kerry McKean can be reached at kerry.mckean@med.navy.mil.<br />Please note, a Justification for Other Than Full and Open Competition will be posted within 14 days of award.<br />
