The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR), are collaborating on the subject Broad Agency Announcement.  The NIAID and NCRR encourages the submission of grant applications and/or contract proposals for the establishment of Regional and National Biocontainment Laboratories, respectively, in order to further the research capabilities of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID), NIAID, to conduct research on Category A, B, and C priority pathogens that are considered to be of significant research importance. The list of pathogens is provided at the following weblink: (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/dmid/bioterrorism/bandc_priority.htm).  Only domestic (U.S.), non-Federal, public or private non-profit organizations that support biomedical research are eligible to apply.  Awards under this program are contingent on availability of appropriated funds and NIAID appropriations authority provided at the discretion of Congress.  In February of 2002, the NIAID developed a strategic plan for biodefense research in consultation with a Blue Ribbon Panel to accomplish short- and long-term goals aimed at protection of the United States and the world population against attacks by these agents.  The NIAID strategic plan emphasizes both basic research and the application of the basic research to the development of products such as diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.  The Biocontainment Laboratories being solicited through this Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) will be an integral part of the biodefense research agenda of the NIAID.  This BAA will consist of two parts:  Part A - Regional Biocontainment Laboratories (RBLs) to be awarded as grants and Part B - National Biocontainment Laboratories (NBLs) to be awarded as contracts.  PART A - RBLs:  The overall planned objective of the RBL construction program is to provide funding to design, build, renovate, certify and install fixed equipment into state-of-the-art BSL-3 biocontainment laboratories and the necessary associated BSL-2 labs, animal facilities, and research support space.   RBLs will be required to preferentially support the research activities of NIAID Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (RCE), as well as other NIAID funded biodefense and emerging infectious diseases research.  RBLs will be part of the NIAID RCE Biodefense Network and will serve as a regional resource for research institutions in the region.  In addition, RBLs will be required to be available and prepared to assist national, state, and local public health efforts in the event of a bioterrorism emergency.  PART B - NBLs:  The overall objective of the NBL construction program is to provide funding to design, build, and certify comprehensive, state-of-the-art BSL-4 biocontainment laboratories and the necessary associated BSL-3 labs, BSL-2 labs, animal facilities, and research support space. NBLs will serve as a national resource for efforts in conducting clinical and laboratory (in vitro and in vivo) research and testing on hazardous biological agents in support of the NIAID?s Biodefense Agenda.  NBLs will be required to preferentially support the research activities of NIAID Regional Centers of Excellence for Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (RCE), as well as other NIAID funded biodefense research.  NBLs will be part of the NIAID RCE Biodefense Network and will serve as a national resource for research.  In addition, NBLs must be available and prepared to assist national, state, and local public health efforts in the event of a bioterrorism emergency.   BAA-NIH-NIAID-NCRR-DMID-03-36 will be available electronically on or about October 15, 2002, and may be accessed through the NIAID Contract Management Branch (CMB) home page at http://www.niaid.nih.gov/contract.  Any responsible offeror may submit a proposal that will be considered by the Government.  This announcement does not commit the Government to make an award.  No collect calls will be accepted.  No facsimile transmission will be accepted.  The Point of Contact for Grant Applications for RBLs is Mary Kirker, Grants Manager Officer, Phone 301-402-6400, Email mk35h@nih.gov, Fax 301-480-3780 and Linda Shaw, Grants Management Specialist, Phone 301-402-6611, Fax 301-480-3780, Email ls15k@nih.gov.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL

BUYUSA.COM CONTRACTED PARTNERSHIPS

UNITED STATES & FOREIGN COMMERCIAL SERVICE


I. 	Background
The U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service ("US&FCS" or "U.S. Commercial Service") is the worldwide client service delivery arm of the International Trade Administration (ITA), operating over 100 U.S. Export Assistance Centers (USEACs) domestically, and approximately 150 Commercial Posts in 80 countries overseas. The US&FCS is statutorily mandated to provide export promotion and facilitation services, products and programs to small and medium-sized U.S. business enterprises (SMEs) globally. Commercial Officers and Specialists in our overseas posts, and Trade Specialists in our USEACs in the United States, counsel such firms; offer strategic export planning expertise; assist with trade mission and event participation; and develop and deliver client-requested market intelligence and trade data. The US&FCS also provides on a cost recovery user-fee basis a wide range of market research, trade contacts, matchmaking (i.e., U.S. seller with foreign buyer) and business facilitation products and services.

The BuyUSA program of the US & FCS is specifically structured to connect the BuyUSA.com web site users to the global network of US&FCS trade experts, thereby offering U.S. exporters and international buyers and distributors Internet-based export services and customized export solutions.   The BuyUSA.com web site is fully US Government-owned, and is located at  www.buyusa.com

II.	Purpose
This Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued to obtain responses from firms interested in working cooperatively with the US&FCS to structure and implement public-private partnerships resulting in increased marketing, promotion and subscription sales for the BuyUSA.com website and program. The US&FCS specifically does NOT seek to fund such activities, and partnerships are to be proposed at no cost to the US&FCS. Where a proposal seeks to obtain revenue for the partner submitting the proposal, such revenue may be sought through a sharing, between the partner and the US&FCS, of the subscription income generated by that partner's marketing activities.  

Increased marketing, promotion and sales activities under this RFP should include all or some but not necessarily be limited to the following, all of which are part of the US&FCS/BuyUSA program:

1.	Placement of the BuyUSA logo, and accompanying text, on the marketing partner's web site in an area viewed by large numbers of small and medium-sized businesses engaged in, or likely to be interested in, exporting U.S.- made goods and services.

2.	Creation of web site links from various partner web sites to BuyUSA.com for the specific purpose of bringing potential users of and subscribers to BuyUSA.com to the appropriate links or location(s) on BuyUSA.com and/or other relevant US&FCS websites.

3.	Creation of web site links from BuyUSA.com to various partner web sites where the link clearly adds value to US&FCS efforts to demonstrate the potential value of BuyUSA.com to business seeking to export from the U.S. or increase U.S. exporting activities.

4.	Direct mail, email and similar direct marketing activities that publicize and promote BuyUSA.com to appropriate U.S. exporters and encourages such businesses to become BuyUSA.com members.

5.	Development of export education seminars, conferences and other outreach activities, either independently or in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Commerce, that include publicizing, promoting and marketing the U.S. Commercial Service and its programs, including BuyUSA.com when appropriate. 

6.	Offering US SMEs, through BuyUSA.com or other cooperative Partner/US&FCS activities, export assistance products and services not offered by the US&FCS, and which through the partnership, allow the US&FCS to reach greater numbers of US exporters, or add clear value to existing US&FCS programs. 

III. 	Scope
This solicitation seeks public-private partnership proposals including as described above from U.S. firms that are:

1.	Currently engaged in Internet based business activities which can clearly enhance one or both of the below and are pursuing such activities wholly or in part via a dedicated Internet business model or presence, and
2.	Currently engaged in the facilitation of buying, selling, or promoting U.S. goods and services; and/or 
3.	Currently engaged in promotion and/or facilitation of exporting of goods and services from the United States. 

Number/Length of Partnerships
The Department of Commerce reserves the right to make multiple awards as a result of this RFP while also reserving the right to limit new awards when it determines that a desired competency has been satisfied. The period of performance for each resulting award will be not less than a one (1) year period and not more than a three (3) year period of service with the option to renew by agreement of both parties.  The Department of Commerce reserves the right to decline proposals from entities that currently have contracts or agreements in areas that potentially overlap with the subject of this RFP, (e.g., agreements for U.S. export promotion facilitation, including exporter referral and matching services and U.S. exporter databases).  In the alternative, the Department may require the termination of such contracts or agreements prior to or as a precondition to the initiation of a contract or agreement resulting from this RFP.

Partnership Activation Schedule
Because this solicitation may result in multiple awards and partnerships of differing natures, selected partners may be incorporated in the BuyUSA program and activated on the BuyUSA.com site at anytime following selection,   subject to considerations such as the value of partner's offerings to BuyUSA subscribers, ease and cost of integration, compatibility of partner's offerings with BuyUSA capabilities and brand, and others. Detailed plans and timelines will be agreed upon mutually between the US&FCS and each selected partner. 

IV. 	Business Considerations Related to this Solicitation.
In order to assist firms considering or preparing a response to the RFP, the following areas will be of interest to the US&FCS in the formation and operation of any business relationship (s) resulting, and will be addressed in any subsequent implementation of partnerships.
 
1.	Revenue Generation. As noted above, such US&FCS partnerships will be on a no-cost basis to the Department of Commerce; i.e., partners will not be paid with US Government funds for their services.  Rather revenues under partnerships resulting from this RFP may  be derived by a sharing of subscription revenue between the partner and the US&FCS. Apportionment of  revenue shares will be agreed upon between the US&FCS and contracted partners prior to incorporating partner offerings into the BuyUSA program.

2.	Data and Related Rights.  All rights in data, trade and service marks, materials, logos licensing and  other Intellectual Property Rights issues arising from contracted partner offerings, will be expressly agreed upon between the US&FCS and such partners prior to incorporation of these offerings into the BuyUSA program and web site.

V. 	Evaluation Criteria
 
Proposals submitted will be evaluated using these evaluation criteria, which are listed in order of importance.

1.	Company's demonstrated sustained operation for at least two (2) years, in combination with a sustainable business plan and model. 

2.	Proposal's consistency with the US&FCS Statutory Mandate (included at end of this document) and commitment to working under all applicable U.S. Government  statutes, regulations, policies and priorities.

3.	Company's/Proposal's suitability for presence on a U.S. Government web site, which will be evaluated in terms of, but not limited to, the following considerations: criminal or civil violations charged or pending; debarment or suspension actions; documented unfair trade practices; inappropriate or illegal business practices; reasonable potential for embarrassment to the U.S. Government; or any other consideration which could jeopardize the US&FCS mission of promoting U.S. exports abroad or the objectives of BuyUSA.com.

4.	Company's demonstrated success in the development and operation of internet-based services and tools that provide at least one type of export assistance to U.S. businesses. 

5.	Proposing company is widely recognized by U.S. firms as having expertise in various elements essential to exporting, including export education, market research and other export intelligence, trade promotion, trade partner matchmaking, trade finance, export shipping and logistics, export compliance, export risk management, and international financial transactions and settlement.

6.	Proposing company has established business relationships with large (eg. 5000 or more) client databases that include companies that are appropriate targets for BuyUSA.com promotional campaigns. Where multiple respondents offer similar marketing activities, preference may be given to respondents who are better able to demonstrate a greater reach in terms of raw numbers and the greater reach to exporting or export ready U.S. SME's.

7.	Compatibility of the partner's mission, programs, products and services with US&FCS programs; specifically, the respondent must be engaged in providing export assistance to significant numbers of US businesses and demonstrate current, active selection of export-related products and services intended and appropriate for small and medium-sized firms.

VI. 	Instructions to Interested Firms  (Note: This supersedes previous Request for Proposals)
Proposals will be accepted for 90 (ninety) days from the date of issuance. Any proposals submitted after the date and time for receipt will be considered if a programmatic need still exists and US&FCS resources permit. 
E-mail response is preferred and should include the subject: "BuyUSA.com Contracted Partnerships". Email responses should be submitted to the following individuals:

VIII. 	Additional  Information on Selection Process. 

1.	Non-exclusivity.   The US&FCS can not under this process provide or warrant to any contracted partner exclusive rights to offer any type of product, service, or capability within the BuyUSA program; thus multiple awards for the same or similar export-enhancing offerings may result.

2.	Partner Selection and Implementation.  Selection will be made by the US&FCS based on (1) assessment of offeror responses against criteria provided above; and (2) direct discussions between the US&FCS and offerors addressing business, programmatic, technical and business aspects of possible contracted partnerships.  Resulting partnerships may be implemented at any time mutually agreed upon by the US&FCS and selected partner(s) and need not await the closing date of this solicitation and/or consideration of all proposals received.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Robert Morris Acquisition Center for the Natick Soldier Center, Natick, MA intends to procure improved, commercially available materials to fabricate Chemical Patient Wraps with.  This is not a synopsis for the manufacture of the Chemical Pat ient Wraps.  This acquisition will be performed using Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items procedures.   Due to the complexity of the requirements and need for an attachment to the Request for Proposal, this is not a combined synopsis/solicitation.  This solicitation is being conducted as a Request for Proposal (RFP).  The RFP number is DAAD16-03-R-0002.  The RFP may be downloaded on/or about November 22, 2002 at https://www3.natick.army.mil (go to Business Opportuni ties, then to Ongoing Acquisitions, then to RFP number DAAD16-03-R-0002).  Prospective Offerors are advised to read this entire synopsis before downloading the RFP and attachment.  The attachment is available for downloading at this time at the same web si te as above.  This competition is being conducted as full and open.  The acquisition will be procured using two separate vehicles and will consist of three steps.  Step 1 will be government evaluation of fabric submitted with offerors proposal; Step 2 wil l be a purchase order(s) for limited quantities of material; Step 3 will consist of those companies whose material has passed all Government evaluation criteria (see below), receiving award of a separate five-year Indefinite Quantity/Indefinite Delivery co ntract (please see limitations detailed below).  The applicable NAICS Code for this acquisition is 313312.  For the purpose of this requirement, any concern employing 500 or fewer employees is considered a small business.  The Berry Amendment does not appl y to this solicitation  The U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center at Natick is seeking firms with the capability of manufacturing the next generation of materials for a product improvement of the Chemical Protective Patient Wrap defined by MIL-C-44313 (GL) (MIL SPECS are provided for t echnical guidance only).  This item is a chemical agent protective system to protect uncontaminated/decontaminated litter patients from chemical agent exposure while awaiting evacuation to a field hospital and during movement through a contaminated area. The wrap shall be capable of providing respiratory and percutaneous protection for unmasked, uncontaminated patients for a minimum of six hours after initial exposure to all known potential chemical warfare agents.   Design of the patient wrap is expected to remain the same as defined in MIL-C-44313 (GL) except for minor modifications to port areas and closures.  New and improved fabric technologies are being sought for the three (3) components of the patient wrap system  a ground cloth, a permeable top la yer, and a clear window material.   Ground cloth material must be totally impervious to moisture of any kind, including liquid chemical agents, and must be capable of being seam-sealed using available seam-sealing technologies for chemical protective items.  The color on both sides of the ma terial shall approximate Camouflage Green 483 (color chip #34094 of FED-STD-595). The permeable top layer must allow for exchange of O2/CO2.  A laminated fabric system is preferred for this layer but fabric systems consisting of separate shell and liner will also be considered.  Shell fabric or upper surface of a laminate must be water repellent so that the protective characteristics of the fabric system will not be degraded by exposure to moisture such as mist, rain, snow, or salt water spray.  Color shall be Woodland Camouflage print.    The chemical protective window material must be transparent to allow clear visibility of patient.  Material must also be capable of being seam-sealed using available seam-sealing technologies for chemical protective items.   All component materials for the wrap must be declared safe for use by the Office o f the Surgeon General (component materials passing the skin toxicity tests performed by the Government will be considered safe for use).  All candidate fabrics shall meet all the requirements detailed in the tables posted in the PATIENT WRAP INFORMATION PA CKAGE, which can be viewed/downloaded at https://www3.natick.army.mil  (go to Business Opportunities, then to Ongoing Acquisitions, then to this solicitation number).   The posted package will contain the following:  program description, listing of tests t o be performed, test methods to be used, and test criteria.   RFP DAAD16-03-R-0002 will contain information/instructions to Offerors, the down-selection process, and evaluation criteria.   Each company may submit only one candidate material for each of the material requirements i.e. ground cloth, breathable top layer, and window material.  Multiple submissions from a company and its subsidiaries, partners etc. will be disallowed.  Any compan y submitting more than one material for each requirement will be asked to choose the one material they wish to have included in the competition.  Companies will be required to submit ten (10) linear yards of material with its proposal, at no cost to the Go vernment, along with test data and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) for all substances used in the manufacture of the materials for Government consideration.   The four (4) areas to be evaluated are the Technical Performance Area, Suitability for Manufacturing into End Items Area, Price Area, and Past Performance Area.  Technical is the most important area and slightly more important than Suitability for Manufact uring into End Items.  Both are greater in importance than the Price Area and Past Performance Area, which are of equal importance to each other.   Technical Performance Area is greater than Suitability for Manufacturing into End Items Area, which is greater than the Price Area, which is equal to the Past Performance Area. When all evaluation factors other than price are combined, they are significantly more important than price. Initially, candidate materials will be evaluated for skin toxicity and conformance with basic physical performance requirements (thresholds), which must be met in order to remain in the evaluation process.  Those candidates passing for skin toxicity and in itial physical properties performance will then be subjected to chemical agent swatch testing.  Those candidates passing for chemical agent swatch testing will then be further evaluated and will receive weighted scores and ranking.  Factors used for the ra nking will include: Ground Cloth:  Strength (tear, break, abrasion resistance) Permeable top layer: chemical protection, O2/CO2 exchange/ air permeability, laminate construction vs. two layer system, liquid repellency Window Material:  Window material must be resistant to chemical agents and transparent to allow full visibility of patient.  Material must also be capable of being seam-sealed using available seam-sealing technologies for chemical protective items. Up to three vendor(s) for each material category (ground cloth, top cloth, and window) receiving the highest weighted scores and rankings may receive a purchase order for the successful materials (50  100 linear yards of Ground Cloth and Permeable Top Lay er material and 25 - 50 linear yards of Clear Window Material).   This means the Government may award up to nine (9) purchase orders (up to three (3) for each material).  A series of prototype wraps encompassing all possible combinations of the materials procured through the purchase orders will be constructed by the Government using submitted materials in order to evaluate suitability of the materials for use in the patien t wrap system.  Materials will be evaluated and ranked for ease of manufacturability by technical experts based on the following factors:  ability of a material to be stitched to the other components of the patient wrap system, ability to be seam-sealed using current seam-sealing technologies for chemical protective items, compatibility with other component materials, and user evaluation panels assessment of suitability for mission use.  Past Performance and Price will be evaluated after the t echnical evaluation is completed and prior to the award of purchase order(s).      For those materials  passing manufacturability requirements, a 5-year Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (ID/IQ) contract is contemplated for this action.  This is the only synopsis notice of the five-year ID/IQ requirement that will be published.  Th e 5-year life of the contract will consist of the base year plus 4 option years.  The Government anticipates a minimum of one and a maximum of up to three contract awards for each type of material (CLIN).  The minimum and maximum quantities to be purchased  under the 5-year life of this effort are as follows: If only one contract is awarded per CLIN, Minimum and Maximum Quantities will be as follows: Ground Cloth, minimum 7,500 linear yards  maximum 97,500 linear yards Permeable Top Layer, minimum 7,500 linear yards  maximum 97,500 linear yards Clear Window Material, minimum 2,500 linear yards  maximum 32,500 linear yards If two contracts are awarded on any CLIN, Minimum and Maximum Quantities will be as follows for each contract: Ground Cloth, minimum 3,750 linear yards  maximum 48,750 linear yards Permeable Top Layer, minimum 3,750 linear yards  maximum 48,750 linear yards Clear Window Material, minimum 1,250 linear yards  maximum 16,250 linear yards If three contracts are awarded on any CLIN, Minimum and Maximum Quantities will be as follows for each contract: Ground Cloth, minimum 2,500 linear yards  maximum 32,500 linear yards Permeable Top Layer, minimum 2,500 linear yards  maximum 32,500 linear yards Clear Window Material, minimum 833 linear yards  maximum 10,834 linear yards Delivery of materials will be required within 30 days of receipt by the contractor(s) of a signed delivery order.  The Offerors must propose a delivery schedule within this timeframe, and note quantities required for cost breaks and specific delivery timel ines for those quantities.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of Logistics Management, on behalf of Overseas Buildings Operations, anticipates awarding ONE indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery contract to an eligible 8(a) Architect/Engineer (A/E) (not an E/A) concern pursuant to the provisions of section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, as amended (1S U.S.C. 637(a)). The small business concern shall be a professional, licensed architectural firm to provide architectural and engineering services for new construction projects, project planning, facility renovation, rehabilitation, restoration, and system replacement projects, physical and technical security upgrades, and the construction and renovation of post communications centers at foreign service posts worldwide. The applicable NAICS code is 541310.  At least fifty percent of the cost of contract performance incurred for personnel shall be expended for employees of the concern. Construction projects are not expected to exceed $5million.  Projects may include design-build definition or bridging work. Such projects may affect the A/E's ability to participate in follow-on work or design-build teams for that project. Each contract shall consist of a one-year base period with four one-year optional service periods.  The Government guarantees a minimum of $100,000 in task orders over the life of the contract.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>REQUEST FOR INFORMATION - ENTRY EXIT SYSTEM

This notice is a follow-up to notices posted on May 2, 2002, May 24, 2002, May 28, 2002, July 12, 2002 and August 21, 2002 identifying the Department of Justice (DOJ), Immigration and Naturalization Service's (INS) intent to acquire an integrated, automated information system (AIS), which will be known as the "United States Entry Exit System (EES)."


The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is issuing this Request for Information (RFI) to solicit information from commercial entities capable of providing the services and products described herein.  The work efforts will include the design, development, assembly, construction, integration, deployment and on-going support for a system to record the arrivals and departures of individuals to and from the United States of America and its territories.

The system, known as the Entry Exit System (EES), will have to be designed to comply with multiple architectural, technical, security, business processes and legislative requirements.  The system must enable the verification of the identity of individuals who intend to enter and exit the United States, note if an individual overstays the terms of their entry conditions and produces reports of all tracked activities.

The new EES will interface with multiple existing, and future, Government and commercial industry databases.  The successful offeror will be required to demonstrate the interoperability, scalability, security, and evolvability in an open architecture environment using generally accepted standards and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products to the maximum extent possible.  Proposed solutions must address the inclusion of various biometrics identifiers that are both currently available and planned.

This RFI is not a Request for Proposal (RFP), but rather, is an exploratory request to identify capabilities, obtain expressions of interest, determine the availability of COTS products, market information, and contractor capabilities for Government planning purposes.  The Entry Exit Program Team is seeking to identify and resolve concerns regarding the feasibility of the requirements, integration of the various technologies and other industry concerns or questions related to this acquisition.

BACKGROUND OF THE EES:

The United States has more than 300 air, land, and sea ports-of-entry (POEs) through which international travelers are inspected and permitted to enter the United States in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  Each year, there are more than 500 million entries into the United States through these POEs.  This volume is projected to rise steadily - intensifying the need to improve the Government's ability to manage our borders.  In addition, the Government must effectively and efficiently determine the admissibility of international travelers while maintaining the commitment to an open society.

The primary Government users of the EES will be the Departments of Justice, State, Treasury, Transportation and Homeland Security (when established).  Together, these departments share the principal responsibilities for managing the borders in order to protect the U.S. and its territories from threats to our national security, enforce immigration and customs laws, and promote economic prosperity through the facilitation of legitimate cross-border trade and travel.

Additional background information related to regulatory requirements having an impact on the EES may be found at the following links:

        USC Title 8, Chapter 13, Immigration and Naturalization            Service
	http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/ch13.html,

	USC Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part IX, Sec.         1365a., Integrated Entry and Exit Data System
	http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1365a.html,

	USC Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part II, Section         1187, Visa Waiver Program for Certain Visitors
        http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1187.html,

	Data Management Improvement Act (DMIA) Task Force
	http://www.ins.usdoj.gov/graphics/lawenfor/bmgmt/inspect/dmia.htm

OBJECTIVES:

The Entry Exit Program (EEP) is a joint effort by the aforementioned Departments with the intent of significantly improving the processes, policies, workforce, and systems utilized to manage the pre-entry, entry, stay, and exit of international travelers through established POEs.  Briefly, the focus of the EEP is contained in the following four process areas.

1-	The pre-entry process concerns visa eligibility determinations and the denial of visa applications from inadmissible aliens through the use of more timely, complete, and accurate data, including biometrics.

2-	The entry process concerns the ability to manage travelers at POEs through a more accurate and timely inspection process.  The objective is to improve the accuracy, efficiency and consistency of the overall entry process with respect to detecting fraudulent travel documents, verifying traveler identity, and determining traveler admissibility through the use of more complete and accurate data, including biometric data.

3-	The stay management process will enable the proper determination, validation and reporting of an alien's status which will have a bearing on the eligibility of the alien to receive (or not receive) a requested benefit.  All existing administrative and adjudication functions must be considered in order to address this requirement.

4-	The exit process concerns the ability to capture, record and report on traveler departure data.  This information supports the accuracy, reporting and data integration across the Border Management Community.
	
	In addition, the EES must be designed to accommodate the following characteristics:
	
Collaboration across the Border Management Community through tighter integration of processes and data relevant to travelers, cargo, and means of conveyance.

Cooperation with Federal, State, and local intelligence and law enforcement organizations through improved access to more complete and timely data generated by the Border Management Community, as well as information generated by State and local law enforcement activities when the assistance of the Federal law enforcement community is requested.

The ability to meet legislatively mandated improvements in border management processes and systems within required timeframes.
	
	Together, the above areas illustrate the basic framework for an EES that must (1) integrate the current 26 legacy systems and technical services that ensure interoperability, and (2) allow for the incorporation of emerging security and identification applications into an open architecture environment.
	
	Mission Critical Functions:
	
	The mission critical functions, listed below, encompass a broad perspective of the overall minimal system and functionality requirements.  They are not all inclusive, nor restricted to the supporting definitions.

	Data Capture and Validation:  Input and retrieval times of data should be significantly reduced within the confines of the EES.  Data input should have on-line visibility throughout the chain-of-approval in the processes.  The capture of critical data should take into account current practices, automated commercial manifests, and biometric technology.  There should be only limited use of traditional "batch processing".  (Note: the Program Office is particularly interested in industry comments on the gathering and processing of biometric identifier data without unduly delaying processing times at the border.  For example, how might this issue be addressed as it relates to admitting several foreign nationals arriving at a land POE in one vehicle?)

	Data Integration:  Various points of information critical to the review and approval, or non-approval, of data shall be merged.  The EES shall provide for the ability to merge critical links and facilitate the improvement of the quality of data in the approval/non-approval process.  Information flows, alerts and event triggers should be communicated in real time wherever possible.  These diverse sources are currently being identified through the existing systems and data repositories.

	Solution Integrity:  The EES and its supporting infrastructures shall be redundant without single points of failure.  Integration efforts will be non-disruptive to current operations to the extent practical, without loss of information required to support the mission at all POEs.

	Security:  The system shall meet current and emerging standards of information security and access.  Access to, and the management of, sensitive data is a critical consideration.

	Decision Support and Reporting:  The system shall have an automated workflow capability that allows for leadership, planners and inspectors to request or submit data/information critical to timely review and approval/non-approval of entry and exit decisions.  This functionality should include the capability to model information relevant to policy concerns and overall management concerns.  Through automated and ad hoc reporting capabilities, the system shall rapidly support queries, or data/information interface, to other operational systems with respect to historical or lookout data.  These capabilities shall be presented via a straightforward graphical user interface and on-line electronic forms.

PROCUREMENT STRATEGY:

It is expected that an award for the design, development, integration and deployment of the EES will be conducted in two phases.  The first phase of work to be awarded will consist of a prototype or pilot demonstration effort at several POEs.  The work efforts may be somewhat determined by the offerors in response to the statement of work in the initial RFP.  It is expected that awards in this phase may be made to multiple offerors.

Upon the completion of the prototype demonstration phase, contractors would submit bids for a single award to one vendor team for the implementation / integration phase of the EES.

Due date for response to RFI: 29 November 2002

SUBMISSION OF INFORMATION:

Respondents are asked to provide information which outlines specific capabilities of products and services that may satisfy the broad Governmental requirements as noted herein.  The Government is also interested in relevant experience and contractor qualifications to perform the work envisioned.  Other areas in which the EEP Team is seeking industry input include the following:

Considerations for partnering and the utilization of small business concerns;

Suggested solution(s) related to the complex task of gathering, and processing, biometric identifier data from multiple individuals in a vehicle, for example, at a land POE;

Suggested approaches to technical infrastructure operational support issues;

Identification of methodologies and best practices for product refreshment based on the incorporation of new technologies;

Existing corporate size and presence in the greater Washington D.C. area that would be available to support this effort; and 

Additional information that will be required from the Government in order to develop a sound technical and pricing proposal.

This RFI is NOT to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue an RFP or to ultimately award a contract.  Responses provided by industry will not be considered as proposals nor will any award be made as a result of this RFI.  Any costs incurred as a result of responding to this RFI shall be borne by the respondent and cannot be charged to the Government for reimbursement.  The information in this RFI represents an overview of the anticipated project, is subject to change, and is in no way binding on the Government. 

The Government will not provide any direct feedback to industry in general.  The Government may utilize any information submitted by interested parties to assist in the development of the statement of work for the proposed RFP.  Offerors are advised not to submit any proprietary information that they would not want to be used for this purpose.  A potential offeror may have an idea that does not fit into the existing framework of the current entry exit process, but it may open up the Government to consider the use of a completely new and more effective way of doing business.  Potential offerors are encouraged to suggest any and all ideas they have that can add value to the process.

All information submitted in response to this RFI or requests to be informed of the status of any possible RFP resulting from effort shall be sent to:

Mr. Joseph M. Garforth Jr.
Contracting Officer, Office of Procurement
Immigration & Naturalization Service
425 Eye Street, N.W.
Washington, DC  20536

or via electronic mail to Joseph.M.Garforth@usdoj.gov no later than 3:00 pm on
29 November 2002.  Responses shall be limited to 30 pages in MS Word 97 format and include the name and telephone number of a point of contact having authority and knowledge to discuss responses with government representatives.

<DESC>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) has a requirement to modify, test, maintain, and document the Acquisition Planning and Execution (APEX) system.  The Acquisition Planning and Execution (APEX) system is a web-based system that allows users to electronically develop, save, route for review and approval, and/or print a complete task order requirements package using either Netscape or Internet Explorer browsers.  In addition, APEX guides customers through the process of scoring contractors' proposals in a Fair Opportunity acquisition scenario.  The tool will enable customers to enter a single application (a web browser) and access the form templates they need to develop a requirements package that includes the Statement of Work, the Independent Government Cost Estimate, the funding document, contracting checklist, and other documents, as applicable.  Only Federal Supply Schedule holders will be considered for award.  Specifically, contractors holding GSA schedules under Schedule 70, SIN numbers 132-51 and 132-32.  The period of performance will be one base year and two additional option years.  The Request For Quotation (RFQ) and Statement of Work (SOW) documents can be obtained by e-mail request to bakers@ncr.disa.mil.  Hard copies will not be provided.

Although it is preferred that the vessel be able to transport all personnel on a single run, the Government may allow for staggered departures /arrivals if the proposed vessel(s) will not accommodate all personnel in a single run.

No paper copies of the RFQ and/or amendments will be mailed.  Failure to respond to electronically posted RFQs and associated amendments prior to the date and time set for receipt of quotes may render your quote nonresponsive and result in the rejection of same.

<DESC>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY.  NO PROPOSALS ARE BEING REQUESTED AT THIS TIME


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), located in Atlanta, Georgia, is seeking information in preparation of an anticipated future solicitation for consolidated contact center services.  CDC is known as a trusted and authoritative source of health information on a wide range of public health topics.  CDC currently receives 3 million inquiries a year through telephone calls, e-mails, and written inquiries and these inquiries are handled in a decentralized fashion with variable approaches.  CDC is anticipating moving towards a consolidated commercial performance-based service contract to handle inquiries across the spectrum of public health topics.  CDC would like industry ideas for the application of approaches, best practices, and technologies in the areas of:  customer relationship management (CRM); performance measures; reliable, timely, and confidential inquiry handling; quality assurance; and variations in inquiry volumes related to public health emergencies, news events, and public health media campaigns.


CDC will use the information provided in response to this RFI to assist in developing an acquisition strategy and solicitation.   This RFI is not a Request for Proposals (RFP) and is not to be construed as a commitment by the Government to issue a solicitation, ultimately award a contract or otherwise pay for the information solicited. Responses to this RFI will not be considered as proposals or offers which could be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  CDC is not soliciting company capability statements or marketing materials through this RFI, rather industry feedback and insights on the specific topics noted above.  Responses should be prepared in MS Word format, not to exceed ten pages.  Send responses electronically to CMaddux@cdc.gov no later than 4:00 p.m. (EST), November 20, 2002.  Technical point of contact:  Dottie Knight, Information Resource Management Office, 404-639-2250.

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Port Hueneme Division (NSWC PHD), Port Hueneme, CA, Code 4G60 is seeking additional sources to manufacture the AN/SPQ-9A RADAR Solid-State Driver Amplifier (SSDA).  The SSDA is the first stage RF amplifier for the AN/SPQ-9A RADAR transmitter and has a minimum power gain of 60dB at a bandwidth of 1000MHz.  The SSDA is a single subassembly of the AN/SPQ-9A RADAR.  The AN/SPQ-9A RADAR is installed in U.S. Navy surface combatant ships.  The complete list of technical requirements for the SSDA are described in NAVAL SEA SYSTEMS COMMAND specification control drawing 7002505 (www.phdnswc.navy.mil/procurements, under Synopsis of Proposed Contract Actions).  The shipboard repair procedure for the SSDA consists of disconnecting the connectors and installing a replacement SSDA assembly.  NSWC PHD is considering qualifying one or more sources to meet possibl e future procurement requirements for the SSDA.  IF NSWC PHD decides to proceed with the plan to qualify additional sources, a contract would be let to each selected source to manufacture one first article SSDA.  The contract would require the manufacturer of the first article SSDA to perform all functional, electrical, and environmental tests necessary to demonstrate that their first article SSDA meets the requirements of specification control drawing 7002505.  Additional system compatibility testing will be conducted by NSWC PHD.  If the manufacturer's first article SSDA is proven to meet the specification requirements, and passes the compatibility tests, the manufacturer will be permitted to compete on possible future production contracts for the SSDA. This announcement is not a request for proposal, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information or items submi tted in response to this announcement.  It is anticipated that a solicitation for contract award will be issued in the spring of CY 03.  Parties capable of manufacturing the SSDA should respond in writing no later than 6 December 2002.

<DESC>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, is interested in identifying an industrial partner for the ELF On Hull Antenna Future Naval Capability demonstration. The feasibility of the On Hull ELF receiving antenna was demonstrated during two previous ONR 6.2 Exploratory Development Programs. During FY03, the transition of the technology from those programs to an ONR 6.3 Advanced Development Program will commence. This effort will involve the Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport teaming with an industrial partner to design for manufacturability and build two magnetic core loop Advanced Development Antennas incorporating noise mitigation technologies with platform integration. Successful demonstration of the Advanced Development Antennas may lead to a contract solicitation for production of antennas for each submarine in the fleet plus spares. The Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division, Newport, is interested in conducting a pre-solicitation industry brief to present interested vendors with a more detailed overview of On Hull Antenna technologies and requirements. Vendors with the capability to design and manufacture magnetic core loop antennas who are interested in attending this industry brief (yet to be scheduled) should respond to Ray Smith, as follows: Send your Company Name, Address, Point of Contact, Email Address, Telephone Number, CAGE Code, and reference N66604-03-R-0541 to SmithRD@Npt.NUWC.Navy.Mil.

<DESC>The Internal Revenue Service, Office of Procurement on behalf of Treasury Departmental Offices and its Bureaus, intends to extend the terms and conditions of the current Department of the Treasury Voice Messaging System (VMS) contract number TIRNO-93-D-00024 to Avaya Inc. for up to one year:  the period of March 4, 2003 through September 30, 2003, with an optional period of October 1, 2003 through March 3, 2004.  The current contract, which expires March 3, 2003, consists of software/hardware maintenance, preventive maintenance, installation services, program management, system upgrades/updates including technology refreshment, system engineering, and technical services help desk support. 

The existing VMS Network consists of 79 Avaya Intuity Audix voice messaging systems and three Octel voice messaging systems located throughout the country that are networked together via TCP/IP connectivity to seven Intuity Interchange servers to provide a 24-hour, 7-day a week, state-of-the-art telecommunications system for the Treasury/IRS community.  The IRS Corporate VMS Network supports more than 86,000 IRS employees that use this medium to communicate various types of information to each other in an expeditious manner. The IRS VMS is networked to the Department of Treasury?s VMS Network via an Intuity Interchange server, which allows transmission of messages between Treasury and the IRS.  Treasury?s Voice Messaging Network in the Washington Metropolitan area serves 30,000 employees.  Employees send and receive voice mail from across the country, send messages to groups of employees using mailing lists, schedule messages for future delivery, forward messages they receive to other employees and obtain employee mailbox numbers by using the up-to-date on-line VMS directory feature.  Access is accomplished from an employee's desk phone, desk-top PC (which allows integration with e&#64979;mail, providing unified messaging of voice mail, fax and e&#64979;mail into a single Exchange message access window, such as Microsoft Outlook), or by dialing into the system from anywhere in the country using local, FTS2001, or toll-free service.  The VMS is also accessible by IRS' hearing impaired employees that have a TTY terminal.  IRS employees regularly receive broadcast messages from the Commissioner and other senior executive level staff regarding the filing season and other significant issues.

<SUBJECT>99 -- REQUEST FOR IMPACT INFORMATION ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS POTENTIALLLY AFFECTED BY A PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEE FOR PURCHASE PROCUREMENT LIST
<DESC>This notice does not constitute a request for information, quote or proposal for procurement of products or services.  The Committee for Purchase has been asked to consider adding the below listed product(s) to its Procurement List (PL).  This action would be taken under the authority of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day (JWOD) Act of 1971, whose purposes include providing employment opportunities for persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities through Federal Government purchases from nonprofit agencies employing such individuals.  Product(s) added to the PL must subsequently be purchased from a nonprofit agency(ies) designated by the Committee.  An addition to the PL could have severe adverse impact on a company?s overall financial status.  

Items being proposed are: Bookends, Non-skid, Black, 5" (7520-00-NIB-1632); Markers, Dry Erase, Premium (7520-00-NIB-1428); and U.S. Air Force Technical Manual Binder (7510-00-241-4958).

In determining whether a product is suitable for addition to the PL, the Committee considers the impact on commercial firms who are providing the product(s) to the Government as MAS/BPA vendors.  Specifically, the Committee considers the potential impact on the firm?s sales, and the extent to which the firm is dependent on the income from such sales to the Federal Government.  It is then the Committee's responsibility to determine whether the benefits of adding a product, or a portion thereof, to the PL offset any potential adverse impact on commercial firms. 

To determine whether the addition of the product(s) listed in this notice would have a severe adverse impact on a firm, the Committee will consider its total annual sales from all sources for the most recent 12-month period for which data is available.  It also needs to receive information on the total revenue derived by a company in the same 12-month period from the sale of the products being considered for addition to the PL.  Documents substantiating the total revenue sales figures must also be provided.  If audited data is available, it should be provided.  You may also wish to notify your employees or their representatives about this possible addition to the Procurement List. 

When the Committee assesses impact on a contractor, it takes into account the sales of the parent, subsidiary, and affiliated corporations as well.  If a company is a parent, subsidiary, or affiliated corporation to another corporation, the Committee requests the other corporations to which the company is related and the nature of the relationship be identified, and that total sales information data is provided for the other corporations.  

If the information provided the Committee is considered confidential, please advise and it will be safeguarded.  Because of the tight time constraints associated with adding products to the PL, it is essential that the Committee receive the information by the response date indicated on this notice.  If no information is received by that date, the Committee will consider that there will be no severe adverse impact on any commercial firm should the listed product(s) be added to the PL. 

For more information concerning the Committee and its authority, refer to Title 41 United States Code, Sections 46-48c or Title 41 Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 51.  You may also telephone Mr. Barry S. Lineback, Operations Analyst on the Committee staff, at (703) 603-0035 for further information.
