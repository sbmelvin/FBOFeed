<DESC>The objective of this procurement is to develop state-of-the-art alternatives for the waste package final closure welds at the proposed Yucca Mountain repository.   The alternatives will be developed through an integrated system engineering study and development of next-generation technologies and material products, which are compatible with ultimate disposition requirements of the repository.  Such alternatives will focus on enhancing process efficiency, residual stress management, and metallurgical stability of the final closure weld for the Alloy 22 outer lid of the waste package and offer a more schedule and cost effective alternative to the baseline gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process.  For maximum benefit, the selected alternatives should also have a capability for providing closure welds for the Stainless Steel and Alloy 22 inner lids of the waste package without a redesign of the waste package. This would optimize the fabrication of a complete waste package using a single technology within a single welding facility.
