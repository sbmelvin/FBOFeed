<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure professional services on a sole source basis from Search Technologies, Norcross, Georgia for text mining support. Specialized Information Services (SIS) Division requires the expertise of Search Technology to provide services in developing an operational prototype for a text-mining tool to be used for SIS databases. The SIS Division of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is responsible for information coverage and services for several areas including environmental health and toxicology, AIDS, and directories to other information resources concerned with health and biomedicine. To facilitate a more effective understanding of the database content by both the consumer and the health professionals, SIS is investigating a variety of different data presentation techniques to gain insight into whether pictorial, graphical and/or other different display techniques can enhance the searching and access functionality of the chemical, environmental, toxicology and health information available in the SIS databases. Prototyping with text mining tools and then testing the discovery effectiveness will be a step in meeting this objective. In Task 1 the contract shall - 1) Understand the Hazardous Substance Data Bank (HSDB) fields and their content and explore available index resources that could be applied to each (e.g., MeSH classification). This will include traveling to NLM in Bethesda, MD, for consultation with the NLM staff and a presentation of the planned research. 2) Apply Tech OASIS to HSDB to list and tabulate the parameters of interest (from among the 95 or so candidate fields) ? e.g., particular disease entities and chemicals. 3) Clean the items within the lists of interest?e.g., as needed, apply fuzzy clean-up algorithms to reduce simple variations; develop suitable thesauri (taxonomies) to consolidate variations of particular concepts (different terms for the same disease). 4) Present results to NLM advisors to determine their suitability. 5) Generate Tech OASIS files for two HSDB topical examples of interest to particular toxicology researchers and NLM managers. In Task 2 the contractor shall - 1) Generate a moderate sample of co-occurrence matrices that combine two parameters (lists) to explore perceived value to different research and research management interests. 2) Determine entity extraction and text processing needs to effectively treat particular parameter information. 3) Experiment with two topical search sets to assess how best to extract entities of interest, consolidate pertinent information across fields, and generate effective representations. 4) Extract relationships based upon term co-occurrence ? i.e., generate various maps of key parameters to display the spread of information across the HSDB records, and tailor for different users & their information needs. 5) Obtain NLM feedback [iteratively with the prior tasks]. Based on over twenty-five years of government research experience and nine years experience in developing software for text mining and bibliometers, Search Technology is the only known source to provide this service. The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner in which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the referenced services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information. NLM Synopsis No. NLM 02-183/CYC.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to Cara Y. Calimano, Office Automation Technician, NLM on (301) 496-6127. FAX REQUESTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

This monitoring consist of the processors, file systems,    log files, system processes, memory, event log, & registry    entries.   3. Manage the switches throughout the network and provide Fa   ult Management Connectivity Management, and Switch Managemen   t (such as VLAN information and Cisco MIB information).   4. To raise the level that our customers are receiving by re   ducing the network downtime through faster warning, diagnosi   s, and repair of problems.   5. Integration of Management Applications. Clinical Center i   s in need of all Information Technology (IT) tools to be int   egrated together. Having different management consoles, repo   rts, user training as well as the expertise needed to "tie"    all the tools together is not available. Therefore it is req   uired that the IT supplier provide not only the technology b   ut also the infrastructure for integration.    Based upon these requirements we considered technology from    Tivoli, Hewlett Packard (HP) and Computer Associates (CA).   The technology from Tivoli did offer some of the requirement   s listed but did not seem to be as robust or scaleable when    compared to the other vendors The major limitation of Tivoli   's technology is that the other functionality that they did    not provide will be dependent upon our IT staff to integrate    and maintain. With the volatility of IT platforms and new s   oftware releases this can easily become an on-going drain of    personnel to maintain. The associated cost of the ongoing i   ntegration with the Tivoli solution is not within our budget    or approach.   HP's OpenView technology meets some of the requirements at a    very basic level. It is a collection of utilities, or group    of networking tools and applications.  As a whole these too   ls are oriented toward the HP-UX platform and provide limite   d coverage of key management applications. It does not allow    for a more business-oriented view of the environment. It al   so provides a very limited , functional integration and is t   herefore not a viable solution for the Clinical Center.   Unicenter TNG meets all of our requirements. No other soluti   on is integrated out of the box and takes ownership of the i   nfrastructure. This will enable us to be less dependent on s   taff for its integration and upkeep. It will allow for us to    view our environment from a true business perspective. Bein   g scaleable and flexible to our architecture will give us th   e ability to manage events occurring in the environment clos   e to the sources and correlate information coming from multi   ple sources. The same interface is used no matter what platf   orm you are using (UNIX or NT) therefore learning curves wil   l significantly be reduced and thus result in considerable o   perational efficiencies through ease of use. Given our  inve   stment into the Cisco switches and the partnership and integ   ration between the two technologies we are able to leverage    the use of management tools provided by both Computer Associ   ates and Cisco.

<DESC>The U.S. Army TACOM/ARDEC is contemplating issuing a purchase order to Sypris  Data Systems, Frederick, Maryland on a sole source basis for a “Tape Recorder  101 E” for use in telemetry applications, under the authority of FAR 6.302-1.   This type of tape recorder is required to meet the mission need of obtaining  the greatest degree of fidelity in recording data results for munitions  design.  This analog tape recorder has the capability of recording data being  received at a faster data rate.  This is essential because the new classes of  telemeters are transmitting information much faster than current telemeters.   Only one company, SYPRIS, manufactures a recorder, which will record data at  the required rate of 16Mbits/sec.  In addition, it is the only type of  recorder compatible with the telemetry systems being used to acquire this  data. This notice does not constitute an RFP and is not to be construed as a  commitment by the Government.  See Numbered Note 22.

<DESC>NASA/DFRC plans to issue a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) to the Scaled Composites Company, Mojave, CA for commercial "wet" leasing of the Scaled Composite's Proteus high-altitude, long-duration, aircraft for use as a sensing platform in support of various NASA projects or missions such as instrument development and scientific applications experiments with specific research goals and objectives. These services will be provided through a "Call Order" type arrangement.  Objective: The contractor shall be tasked by NASA with flight missions as needed and shall work directly with research teams to integrate and fly the scientific payload(s).  The contractor will fly the scientific payloads(s) as necessary to achieve the research objectives within the limits of call order schedules and flight-hour budgets as approved under the individual call orders issued by the Contracting Officer.   Flights in support of these mission/tasks will be NASA-sponsored and approved, however, instrumentation, hardware and materials may be owned by NASA, university, industry or other government agencies and operated by their respective personnel. This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/DFRC intends to procure the Proteus Aircraft services directly from the Scaled Composites Company, Mojave, CA.  The authority for other than full and open competition is 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) "Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements".

The media blaster must come with a Reverse Pulse Cartridge Dust Collector with 1200 CFM RPH and a HEPA filter. Polyester cellulose filters are to come with the Reverse Pulse Cartridge Dust Collector.  There is to be a timer switch to activate the reverse air pulse to knock off the caked on dust from the dust collection system.

<DESC>The Government intends to issue and negotiate a sole source firm-fixed price contract with Custom Pools, Inc under the authority of FAR 6.302.  This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals; however, the Government will consider capabilities of other interested parties if received within seven days of this publication synopsis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.  The proposed contract action is to renovate the Randolph AFB Center Pool (approximately 70 years old) to include a new chlorination system, a new drainage system and new pool decking.  The intended work is to either replace the existing piping and disinfection equipment or to retrofit the pool with an improved circulation system.  The pool has a vinyl liner, which would require penetration to get to the return drain lines at the bottom of the pool.  The most critical technical issue is associated with the disinfection system and the distribution system.  Contractor must be an authorized distributor of Natare Corporation in order to maintain the integrity of the pool liner and its warranty.  The applicable NAICS is 235990 and the small business size is 12.0M.  The magnitude of this contract action is between $250,000 and $500,000.

This announcement constitutes the only solicitation, quotations are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number, N00259-02 -T- 0072 (RFQ)  is issued  for reference. Clin 0001: Non-personal service contract for  Research Services at the contractor?s site for the period  01 Sep 2002 to 28  Feb  2003.   Qty: 6 ; Unit of issue: month . The billing method will be monthly in arrears.  The duties to be performed shall be in accordance with the statement of work.  The statement of work reads.   STATEMENT OF WORK: Task Title: ?Preventing Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) by Enhancing Glutathione Pathways?  INTRODUCTION: The Department of Defense Spatial Orientation Center (DSOC) of Naval Medical Center, San Diego (NMCSD) conducts ongoing projects in auditory and vestibular research. 1.1   ABREVIATIONS:  DOD = Department of Defense, NIH = National Institutes of Health, NMCSD = Naval Medical Center San Diego, SIU = Southern University of Illinois, GPOC = Government Point of Contact, DSOC = DOD Spatial Orientation Center, HPLC = High Pressure Liquid Chromatography, GSH = Reduced Glutathione, GSSG = Oxidized Glutathione, GR = Glutathione Reductase, GSH-Px = Glutathione Peroxidase, MDA = Malendialdehyde, NIHL = Noise-Induced Hearing Loss, COL = Colonel, MC = Medical Corp, FY = Fiscal Year.  SCOPE: Contractor will conduct research into the biochemical changes that occur within the cochlea in response to intense noise exposures. This work entails performing a series of studies that will determine the time course of any changes in the cochlear levels of reduced glutathione and the ratio of reduced (GSH) /oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, critical enzymes of the glutathione antioxidant pathway, and cochlear lipid peroxidation markers which will be measured prior to noise exposure, and 0.5, 2, 4 and 6 hours after noise exposure.  2.1     Contract Period:  This contract will run for six months. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:  The contractor will determine the time course of any changes in the cochlear levels of reduced glutathione, and the ratio of reduced (GSH)/oxidized (GSSG) glutathione prior to noise exposure, and 0.5, 2, 4 and 6 hours after noise exposure. This will be accomplished by measuring cochlear glutathione, both GSH and oxidized GSSG with high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on cochleae from animals sacrificed at those time periods.  The contractor will use HPLC to measure reduced glutathione, and the GSH/GSSG ratio, an indicator of oxidative stress. In a second set of experiments the contractor will determine the time course of any changes in cochlear glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), critical enzymes of the glutathione anti-oxidant pathway again at the following time points: prior to noise exposure, and 0.5, 2, 4 and 6 hours after noise exposure. The contractor will accomplish this aim by measuring GR and GSH-Px with HPLC on cochleae from animals sacrificed at those time periods. Also in this set of experiments the time course of changes in cochlear lipid peroxidation markers will be determined via HPLC at the same time periods described above. Contractor will measure with HPLC cochlear malendialdehyde (MDA), a marker for cell membrane oxidative damage, on the same cochleae at those time periods.  DUTIES:  4.1 The contractor shall perform a full range of research procedures, within the scope of their training and experience, on site using SIU furnished facilities, supplies and equipment. The primary workload is a result of experiments generated to pursue the specific aims of research funded by the National Institutes of Health and the DOD Spatial Orientation Center, Naval Medical Center, San Diego under the Task Title: ?Preventing Noise-Induced Hearing Loss (NIHL) by Enhancing Glutathione Pathways?.  The contractor?s primary duty is to assess the cochlear biochemical events following damaging sound exposure utilizing High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).  This will be carried out on cochleae harvested from animals exposed to the conditions as described in section 3.1.  DSOC, NMCSD is responsible for carrying out the chamber exposures to no sound (control conditions) and sound exposures on animals. Biological samples (cochleae) will be humanely collected by DSOC, NMCSD, in accordance with Federal and State guidelines and regulations from anesthetized and euthanized animals and then shipped on dry ice to SIU for analysis. SIU will complete HPLC analysis on a minimal of 60 animals or 120 ears (cochleae) and an additional 6 animals or 12 ears if problems such as technical, methodological or clinical develop.

Work shall be completed between late September and late November 2002, weather permitting.  The Contractor shall provide a brief work plan along with their proposal.  The Government will make an award selection based on Best Value after considering cost and factors other than cost (i.e., Contractor's experience in the management of invasive plants; working in adverse conditions; and working in areas with sensitive plant and animal species).  The Request for Proposal (RFP) will be made available for electronic access on or about August 20, 2002 with responses due 30 days thereafter.  The RFP, including all terms and conditions and project specifications will be available for review/download at:  http://ideasec.nbc.gov.  Paper copies of the RFP will not be mailed.

<DESC>The National Cancer Institute (NCI), Pediatrics Oncology Branch (POB), Microarray Laboratory intends to procure a Typhoon 9210 Scanner  with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., 800 Centennial Avenue, P.O. Box 1327, Piscataway, NJ 08855-1327.  The supplies and services herein are being prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Part 12.  The acquisition is being made in accordance with the test program for using simplified procedures for certain commercial items authorized by FAR Part 13.  The North American Industry Classification System code is 421450 and the business size standard is 100 employees.  The researchers of the Pediatrics Oncology Branch are dedicated to the study and treatment of childhood cancer. Considerable progress has been made in understanding fundamental processes in the pathogenesis of pediatric cancers. New insights in the cell biology and molecular genetics of specific cancers have led to new targets for therapy. Scientists have demonstrated that cDNA microarray analysis can be used to identify for example, genetic fingerprints of a specific type of muscle cancer, rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), and are able to distinguish one type of cancer from another. The imager will be used for array validation and target prep analysis. Minimum Requirements: (1) quantify the amount of each labeled target prep hybridized to the arrays; (2) maintain better quality control over the microarray experiments; (3) scan and quantitate all genes of interest from microarray experiments, that have been validated by Northern blot analysis; and, (4) analyze a wide variety of fluorescent and radiolabeled assays. To accomplish the above the imager shall have the following features/ specifications: two high power excitation sources (633 nm for scanning storage phosphor screens and red-excited fluorescent samples, and 532 nm for scanning green-excited fluorescent and chemifluorescent samples); simultaneous excitation using green and red sources to increase throughput; six (6) fluorescence emission filters and two (2) beam splitters that are automatically selected by protocol; shall allow filters to be substituted and combined up to a maximum of thirteen (13) in the instrument at one time; shall allow beam splitters to be substituted and combined up to a maximum of five (5) in the instrument at one time; scanning protocols shall be linked if required to allow automatic scanning of up to four (4) fluorescent dyes in one sample; shall measures slow decay chemiluminescent samples; system shall have two objectives permitting the excitation source to be focused at two heights to allow optimal scanning of different thickness samples such as membranes, microplates and sandwich gels; system shall be capable of scanning storage phosphor screens, fluorescent DNA, protein gels, chemifluorescent DNA/RNA, protein blots and chemiluminescent Western blots; shall be a general purpose, full size gel and blot imager with microarray imaging capability; shall uses storage phosphor screens based on industry standard Europium crystals that are sensitive to beta, gamma and X-ray radiation; shall have a minimum of two (2) modes of storage available for phosphor scanning to optimize resolution or sensitivity; storage phosphor screens shall be available unmounted in standard film cassettes or mounted on aluminum backing; storage phosphor screen exposure and scanning shall be allowed in room light and at room temperature, with no special darkroom apparatus; system shall allow multiple radioactive samples to be simultaneously exposed to multiple screens for rapid parallel processing and high throughput; system shall allow chemifluorescent and chemiluminescent samples to be scanned at different time points, thereby eliminating the guesswork associated with film; chemifluorescent and chemiluminescent samples shall not require exposure or re-exposure to film; instrument shall require no consumables such as argon/methane gas, in its operation; shall have a linear dynamic range of five (5) orders of magnitude permitting simultaneous quantification of strong and weak signals and allowing for wider latitude in exposure times; system shall include two (2) photomultiplier tubes allowing simultaneous two color scanning; shall have two (2) dichroic beamsplitters for channel separation with negligible loss of sensitivity; shall provide selectable pixel size of 10,25,50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 micron allowing high resolution (better than 10 line pairs per mm in fluorescence modes, and a low resolution pre-scan facility); shall be compatible with existing Government-owned Molecular Dynamics instruments; shall be compatible and work with existing PhosphorimagerTM, Storm? and Typhoon 8600 storage phosphor screens; shall have a TCP/IP Ethernet connection to communicate between the instrument and computer, allowing the system to work with Internet technology; 
shall have a large format (35cm x 43cm) scanning area for scanning sequencing-size samples or multiple smaller samples; shall include image analysis software for Windows? and MacTM; system shall allow images to be acquired in a 16 bit TIFF format (.GEL extension) for quantification and allow data to be exported to an industry standard 8 bit TIFF format for use in a variety of programs (i.e.,Windows, Mac, or SunTM workstation); system shall include integrated software to control the instrument, scan the sample, acquire the image, and analyze data from a wide selection of applications; and, shall be field upgradable. Shall include a one (1) year parts and labor warranty at no additional cost to the Government.

<DESC>It is the intent of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to procure the Relais Enterprise maintenance and support plus programming, training, and technical support from Relais International, Inc. of Ontario, Canada.  The maintenance support provided by Relais International, Inc. includes the access to the Relais International Support website through report problems, monitor the status of problems once they are reported, search a database of FAQs, patches and all reported incidents, plus membership in the Relais User's Group and all Relais Enterprise software upgrades released during the period free of charge.  The services provided by Relais International, Inc. includes training for NLM staff for Relais system version 3.8, custom programming for NLM enhancements required to support a new print solution, and technical support with new configurations.  In 1996, the National Library of Medicine purchased the Relais Enterprise system to automate the processing and handling of over 400,000 DOCLINE requests which reach NLM for distribution to the Collection Access Section and the History of Medicine Division.  Additionally, the system is used to automate the processing, sorting, and accounting for over 13,000 requests submitted by NLM's patrons using the Locatorplus System to submit requests using the Overnight Photocopy Service.  The National Library of Medicine has a requirement for an automated system that can accept orders from multiple external sources in different formats.  The system must identify the requestor, sort documents according to their library location, redirect orders alternate holdings when items are unavailable, manage exception handling for problem orders, convert documents to the format the client requested (e.g. fax, digital, paper), transmit the document to the client, determine billing amounts, and it must know where the order is in the system at all times.  Benefits of the system must include reductions in labor requirements and reduced cycle times for fulfilling ILL.  NLM requires that the system be MS Windows compliant.  It must be network-based and operate under the Novell LAN environment.  The system must run on Oracle.  The system must operate with scanners capable of reproducing journal articles at the rate of 21 pages per minute.  Only Relais International's Relais system carries the unique capabilities which fit the above stated requirements of the National Library of Medicine.  No other product on the market that has been developed for automating library services provides the capabilities of this system or is suitable for this environment.  The Relais System is a proprietary product of Relais International, Inc.  Since Relais International, Inc. is the sole owner of the Relais System, NLM has determined that Relais International, Inc., is the only source with the previous experience and expertise capable of providing the necessary technical support and system upgrades.  The proposed acquisition will be procured under FAR Part 12 - Acquisition of Commercial Items.  This is not a Request for Quotation (RFQ), nor is an RFQ available, however, all responsive sources may submit a proposal in a timely manner which will be considered by NLM.  Firms interested in responding to the notice must be able to provide the services as specified above.  Responses must be in writing and must be received in the office within fifteen (15) calendar days from the publication date of this notice.  Proposal must include pricing information and services described above.  Inquires regarding this procurement may be made to the National Library of Medicine, Office of Acquisitions Management, 8600 Rockville Pike, Building 38A, Room B1N20, Bethesda, Maryland 20894, Attention: Uyen H.

<DESC>The National Park Service intends to award to ATS (Advanced Telemetry Systems, Inc) on a single source basis a contract in the amount of $68,000 for ht e purchase of 20 GPS Collars at $3,000 each =$60, 000, 20 VHF Collars @$300.00 each=$6,000 and one Telemtry receiver at $2,000 for a total of $68,000. These collars are the only collars in the market that have 12 channel capability to collect satellite date. This maximizes our ability to collect data and to determine locations especially in forested area. The serious issue of Chronic Wasting Disease, (CHD), is the concern and inorder to have the most reliable equipment with the best capability ATS is the only one in the market that can provide us with the equipment we need in our location. ATS will also be able to provide on-site consultation and will be able to assist during capture and setup. ATS equipment has antenna adjustment capability that we have not been able to locate in the market elsewhere and this will maximize the masking angle and allow for a much better fit in smaller animals. These collars will be used in a study being conducted to look at Chronic Wasting Disease occurrence and transmission in deer  within and near the Park. This disease has been identifed as a serious threat to cervid populations, and of concern to the public and livestock industry.With the seriousness of this disease, it is important to have the most reliable equipment available to re-locate the deer.This procurement will be made o/a august 15, 2002 . NAICS:334220 P&S:6695 For questions of a technical nature contact Dan Foster at Wind Cave National Park at 605-745-1190 before august 15, 2002.

<DESC>The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) has undertaken a comprehensive, multi-year research program on the subject of wind turbine aeroacoustics. The goals of this effort are to develop a thorough understanding of the mechanisms for generation, propagation, and mitigation of wind-turbine-blade acoustic emissions; to document and disseminate this information in the form of NREL reports, technical papers, seminars and colloquia; and to support the U.S. wind industry in applying rational acoustic-design principles to the development and deployment of advanced wind turbines.

Activities in fiscal year 2000-2001 included a review of previous work, outreach to potential research collaborators, and long-range planning and budgeting.  A successful workshop on ?Fundamental of Aeroacoustics with Application to Wind Turbine Noise? was conducted at the NWTC in July 2001.  It assembled many wind energy researchers and exposed them, through a series of invited lectures, to the current state of knowledge regarding wind turbine aeroacoustics.  Participants also provided their comments and suggestions on NREL?s preliminary aeroacoustics research plan.

Several projects were initiated in fiscal year 2001-2002.  Wind tunnel tests are underway that will measure the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of 6-8 wind turbine airfoils, with emphasis on those profiles currently deployed or under development.   In field tests at the NWTC, acoustic measurements of five small wind turbines were conducted and four other configurations are currently being tested.  A review of semi-empirical acoustic prediction methods was completed, and design-optimization codes are being programmed which employ the best features of this previous work.  Subsequently, we will attempt to incorporate new methods to analyze specific noise sources. Lastly, a new initiative, which is the subject of this solicitation, is being undertaken to develop computational aeroacoustic (CAA) codes to analyze wind turbine blade noise sources as impacted by important configuration variables.  

In contrast to the semi-empirical codes that aggregate various airfoil self-noise sources (inflow turbulence, flow separation, trailing-edge bluntness, boundary-layer trailing-edge interaction, and blade-tip vortex), these CAA methods are seen as implementations of the fundamental equations of motion, supplemented by appropriate acoustic analogy.   We expect they will capture the basic flow physics and resulting acoustic phenomena, thereby allowing the investigation of noise sources and potential mitigation measures.  It is understood that this work is extremely complicated and computationally challenging.  Nevertheless, recent progress in the application of CAA methods to propeller, helicopter and airframe noise offers encouragement that application to wind turbine noise will eventually yield useful results. 

There has been some computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis of wind turbines, but virtually no sustained effort in CAA analysis.  Therefore, it is unlikely that experienced CAA researchers also have complementary wind energy experience.  Because wind turbine aerodynamics per se is quite anomalous, this lack of contemporaneous experience is a potential impediment to research progress.   In recognition of this situation, NREL has formulated a two-phase approach for the project.  In Phase I, those subcontractors that are selected for award will become familiar with previous research in wind turbine aeroacoustics (and relevant aerodynamics).   NREL will assist by providing a comprehensive reference list and copies of documents that are out of print or difficult to procure.   With the benefit of the perspective gained by reviewing this previous work, subcontractors will formulate a computational approach to a particular aeroacoustic problem.  To enhance the likelihood of success, subcontractors may form teams that, collectively, have the requisite experience in CAA and wind turbine aerodynamics.  Researchers at universities, government laboratories and/or private industry are welcome participants.
 
At the conclusion of Phase I, subcontractors will prepare an Interim Report and present their proposed computational approach at an Interim Project Review Meeting attended by key project participants and the NREL review team. The information provided will be used to determine if the proposed approach has sufficient merit to warrant continuation of the project. This decision will be based upon technical accomplishments and programmatic issues.  Those subcontractors selected for Phase II will proceed to implement their proposed computational method and use it for selected benchmark validation studies.  

It is generally believed that the most prominent wind turbine aeroacoustic noise source is the interaction of a turbulent boundary layer with the airfoil (blade) trailing edge.  Some airfoils, however, are particularly susceptible to inflow turbulence and may have significant emissions from the leading edge.  For this reason, care must be taken in selecting airfoil shape and other configuration variables for downwind turbines.  In this case, turbine blades experience significant inflow turbulence as they fly through the tower wake.  If leading and trailing edge noise is minimized, blade tip noise may become an important mechanism when trying to reduce acoustic signatures to their lowest possible levels.  Researchers are uncertain of the exact mechanism for this blade tip noise.  Some speculate it is the result of the interaction of the tip vortex and the trailing edge.  Others believe it results from instabilities in the viscous shear layer between the vortex and free stream.  With these fundamentals in mind, NREL has identified several wind turbine aeroacoustic problems of interest.  Offerors may propose to work on one or more of these problems, or they may propose to work on a different problem if it addresses the specified goals and objectives of the statement of work.

Airfoil self noise ? Several researchers have used experimental results to develop semi-empirical methods to predict leading and trailing edge noise.  Recent studies investigated a more robust computational approach that may eventually permit the analysis of airfoils of arbitrary shape.  Such a method would be useful in evaluating airfoils for use on wind turbines, perhaps obviating time consuming and expensive wind tunnel tests

Blade tip noise ? It is desirable that arbitrary blade tip shapes be modeled and their acoustic emissions estimated, at least in a relative sense.  Wind turbine blades operate in extremely complex flow situations, with unsteadiness due to inflow turbulence, wind shear, pitching blades, and rotational dynamics.  Although it is unlikely that the precise physical properties of this complex flow can be predicted, it may be possible to develop a simplified flow model with estimates of the resulting acoustic emissions.  This would allow the detailed comparison of different shapes with the goal of selecting those that produce the lowest acoustic emissions.

Rotating blades ? A more complex effort involves the modeling of the entire rotor, including twist, taper and airfoil shapes. Further refinement would involve the use of a turbulent inflow model.  This approach has been used (with varying degrees of success) in computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models to predict blade aerodynamic forces.  Extending this approach to include predictions of the aeroacoustic field is an extremely challenging problem, but one that is worth attempting.

Full system model ? A logical extension of the rotating blades (rotor) problem is to model the complete wind turbine, including the tower.  This is particularly important for downwind turbines, where the flow field is made more complex by the shedding of coherent vortices in the tower wake.  This is a recognized problem that has discouraged the development of downwind turbines, which have a reputation for broadband ?tower shadow? noise as well as low-frequency impulsive noise.  The value of a CAA model of this situation is in its potential use to adjust configuration variables to avoid these problems.

The purpose of this pre-solicitation notice is to obtain an indication of the level of interest by potential participants.  Therefore, expressions of interest are sought from potential respondents to the forthcoming Request for Proposal (RFP).  Expressions of interest should include 1) the names, addresses, telephone numbers, facsimile numbers, and email addresses of the primary contact persons; and 2) a statement indicating that you request access to the RFP document.  Expressions of interest should be received at NREL no later than August 30, 2002.  This is not a Request for Proposals.

<DESC>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Climate Monitoring and Diagnostic Laboratory (CMDL) proposes to negotiate on a sole source basis, under the authority of FAR 13.106-1(b)(1), with Atmospheric Observing Systems, Niwot, CO for the documentation and assembly of 36 custom precision air sampling systems.  The systems are necessary to support a mandated expansion of NOAA's atmospheric carbon observing system to produce maps of major regional sources and sinks of carbon dioxide at annual intervals.*** The documentation shall consist of assembly drawings, detailed assembly procedures with clear illustrations, and detailed test procedures with illustrations and listing of criteria to be satisfied. *** All units will be assembled from subassemblies  provided by CMDL.  All completed units will be fully operational, pass the leak test for the gas manifold and sample flasks of less than 10-5 cc/s; meet the trace gas stability requirements after 30 days of storage of less than 0.1 ppm change in CO2,   less than 1.5 ppb change in CH4, less than 1 ppb in CO, and less than 0.01 permil in 13C/12C of CO2.   The assembly involves glass, stainless steel, and electromechanical parts, electronics, and sensors packaged in a hard-shell case.  The fully assembled package must pass a drop test from three (3) feet onto a concrete floor without damage to the instrumentation.  The systems must be operational eight weeks after receipt of the subassemblies provided by CMDL ***Atmospheric Observing Systems (AOS) is uniquely qualified to perform the assembly because of (1) experience with assembly of  CMDL units of similar design (particularly important because of the absence of documentation); (2) expertise in the area of high accuracy measurements of carbon dioxide and related trace species; and (3) located in close proximity to CMDL (particularly important to the development of the documentation).  This procurement is being conducted under the FAR Part 13 (NTE $100K).  No solicitation package will be issued.  Information submitted in response to this notice will be used solely to determine if a competitive acquisition would be in the Government's best interest. Anticipated award date is September 5, 2002.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

<DESC>The U.S. Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Southeast Regional Office, St. Petersburg, Florida intends to procure services to collect socioeconomic data for the offshore Gulf shrimp fishermen in Texas.  The last year in which the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) collected costs and returns data for the Gulf shrimp fishery was 1992.  In that case, the data collection was a one time survey that only obtained for a portion of the offshore fleet based in Texas.  Other previous attempts to collect costs and returns data have been similarly plagued by their small scope and/or their limited duration.  Current economic and social data is needed for the Gulf shrimp fishery as a whole in order to accurately assess the positive and/or negative impacts of federal rules and regulations.  Such assessments are mandated under Executive Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Magnuson-Stevens/Sustainable Fisheries Acts (and the National Standards attached thereto), and the Endangered Species Act, among others. 
The purpose of this particular project is to initiate a socioeconomic data collection program for vessels that are based in or primarily operate out of ports in Texas.  Activities associated with the following tasks are expected to commence in September, 2002 and be completed by August, 2003.  Task I:   A strong preference exists for contractors/interviewers who are experienced in fielding socioeconomic surveys, particularly with commercial fishermen.  If the contractor(s) is/are not the actual interviewer(s), then the contractor shall hire, train and supervise personable and qualified interviewers.  The ultimate success of the survey depends on the ability of interviewers to establish rapport with fishermen, to clearly explain the intent of each question, and to understand the answers given by fishermen.  Interviewers should be knowledgeable about the fishery and fishing techniques prior to conducting the interviews.  Task II: The contractor will develop the final stratified and random sample design. Potential strata could include port/county, vessel size, or level of landings/value, among others.  After completion of such, the contractor will select the final sample from a universe of vessels provided by the NMFS economist.   Task III:  The contractor shall work with the NMFS economist to draft the survey instrument.  After such development, the contractor shall pre-test the draft survey instrument to ensure that all questions are easily understood.  Based on the results of the pretest, the contractor shall revise the questionnaire to improve its wording, organization, and content.  Knowledge and experience with models, techniques and data required to perform economic analyses of regulatory alternatives are required to make useful revisions to the draft questionnaire.  The NMFS economist will have final approval of the final instrument, subject to OMB's approval.  The final version of the questionnaire should be designed to facilitate data entry into computer files.  The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) must approve the final survey instrument.  The contractor will prepare the supporting documents necessary to obtain OMB clearance for the survey.  Implementation of the program must await final OMB approval.  The survey instrument must include the following general set of data elements:  1) variable costs, 2) fixed costs, 3) other annual costs, 4) capital investment in the vessel, gear and electronics, and 5) socio-demographic information.  Subject to OMB approval, the NMFS economist has final approval over the survey instrument, its content, and structure.  Task IV: The contractor shall contact vessel owners and operators, schedule interviews, and then use the OMB approved survey instrument (Task III) to conduct personal interviews with offshore shrimp fishermen in Texas to collect the desired information.  Task V:  The contractor shall enter the data into computer files that can be read and manipulated by the NMFS economist using IBM-compatible personal computers.  It is preferred that the data be coded in Dbase, Excel, SAS, or SYSTAT/SPSS format, although other formats are permissible provided that the NMFS economist has access to software capable of reading the data.  The contractor will develop appropriate quality assurance/quality control procedures for proper and expeditious editing/proofing of the survey data. Task VI:  The contractor will provide progress reports after each three (3) month time period, beginning on the effective date of award.  Offers will be evaluated upon the following technical evaluation factors:  (1) First-hand knowledge of and experience in developing and fielding socioeconomic surveys; (2) First-hand knowledge of and experience in working with the commercial fishing industry, particularly the Gulf shrimp fishery; (3) Knowledge of sampling theory/design, descriptive, and inferential statistics; (4) Experience in conducting socioeconomic research on the Gulf shrimp fishery; (5) Experience in design, development and maintenance of data bases designed for scientific research purposes; (6) Knowledge of and experience with the OMB/PRA approval process for data collection programs. This procurement is set-aside for small businesses.   The NAICS code is 541720.  The small business size standard is $6,000,000.00.  This purchase will be made under the guidelines of FAR, Part 13, Simplified Acquisitions Procedures.  Firms interested in receiving a copy of the RFQ shall submit a request in writing to the attention of Sharon Clisso at the address listed above.   Please reference RFQ number WC133C-02-RQ-0159SKC.  Facsimile requests will be accepted at (816) 426-7530.

<DESC>THIS NOTICE CONSTITUTES AMENDMENT NO. 2 TO THE  COMBINED SYNOPSIS/RFQ FOR a walk-in freezer.  Companies shall acknowledge all amendment(s) in their quote. This notice serves as the official amendment to subject synopsis/RFQ and a written amendment will not be issued. The purpose of this amendment is to respond to questions submitted by potential offerors. Q1. The requirements of the Cargo Container Freezer does not indicate that the unit needs to be made by a US company.   Are there any restrictions on who builds the unit? ANSWER 1. FAR 52.225-3 Buy American Act-North American Free Trade Agreement-Israeli Trade Act (May 2002) is applicable.  Please review this clause before submitting a quote. Current FAR can be viewed on-line at   http://www.arnet.gov/far/   .     Q2. Can the unit be refurbished? ANSWER 2. New is preferred.  Longer warranties will be taken into consideration. Q3. Do you prefer a new Cargo Container vs. a used? ANSWER 3. New is preferred.  Longer warranties will be taken into consideration. Q4. Do you have any labeling and color requirements? ANSWER 4. No.   Q5. What type of paint requirements need to be followed? ANSWER 5. No lead based paints.  We really have no preference as long as the insulation requirements are met and it is a corrosion-resistive paint. Q6. Are there any security inspection requirements for the cargo contained for post 9-11 concerns and prior to accepting the hardware at completion? ANSWER 6. There will be security and an escort.  All vehicles are subject to inspections. Q7. Under the Basic Requirements section 2. (Basic Structure) you  call out the minimum/maximum payload for this container is 65,000 lbs.  Many states restrict the payload weight to 60,000 lbs or less.   Does NASA operating on permits that allow the units to be over the basic weight requirements or is this a miss print and this number is the Gross weight #??? ANSWER 7. Under no circumstance will we ever have in excess of 65,000 lbs of cargo in the freezer.  60,000 lbs is the acceptable basic guideline.     Q8. What is the Gross weight and what is the Maximum Payload Weight? ANSWER 8. The weight will vary.  Our purpose is to store high-energy batteries.  The total mass of the cargo will never exceed 2 tons (this is a VERY conservative number, we may not even come close to 1,000 lb).  However, we would like to drive an industrial truck or other vehicle into and out of the freezer container (see item 2c of the specifications sheet for definition of industrial truck).   Q9. Are you trying to simulate a standard refrigerated cargo container that has some specialized requirement or is this unit going to be used in a different environment and needs special consideration of the type of construction requirement? 	 ANSWER 9. This unit will be used in Houston environment that can reach temperatures in excess of 100 °F in the summer.  It will be placed on concrete with conduit ran to it for electricity where it will sit as a permanent container for the storage of batteries.  We are trying to purchase a standard refrigerated cargo container.   The only differences should be the lights (item 8) and sampling ports (item 6).   Q10. Do you have a specific spacing requirements of the Anchor Provision for #5. Anchor Components (e.g., brackets, bolts, cables) along the walls of the cargo container? 	 ANSWER 10. No.   Q11. How high is the goods that are going to be stored in the contained and what is the open space distance above the goods? ANSWER 11. Approximately 4 ft.  The purpose for the high ceiling (item 2.b) is to be able to drive an industrial truck into and out of the freezer.  The batteries we are storing can weigh up to 500lbs each.   Q12. What is the spacing between the pallets for air flow? ANSWER 12. Currently they are not stored on pallets but on portable platform trucks (30” width by 60” length).  We prefer approximately 3 ft between the platform trucks for walking room.  Presently, we will not use the total length of the freezer container  The 40 ft length is for expansion in the future.   Q13. How fast do you what the good to reach the -20'C? 	 ANSWER 13. At least one day, sooner if possible.  Q14. Are the good already frozen.	 ANSWER 14. No. Q15. What are your spec's (for the goods).  ANSWER 15. We do not have specifications.  They are batteries.  Just assume it is a typical storage product with a weight of 1,500 lb.    Q16. If the product is already frozen and you want to maintain the product temperature NO problem.  If the product is at room temperature we need a heavier refrigeration system to cool it down is a resonable time span. ANSWER 16. We understand that the definition of a “reasonable time span” is subjective.  That is the purpose of item 3.d.  This is our main concern and we realize it will be a worse case scenario with no product in the freezer.  We can withstand a slower time to reach –20 °C (that is why it is not a requirement).  We cannot tolerate a rapid heat loss in the event of an emergency.  We do not want our batteries to lose temperature over the weekend and begin to heat up when no one is in the office to correct the situation.   If you feel comfortable submitting two scenarios of each refrigeration system (large and small), itemizing the price of each, that is acceptable.   Q17. This is an outdoor freezer, will a rubber membrane roof cap be required? ANSWER 17. As long as there is no leaks, the insulation requirements are met, and the roof load requirement is met, a rubber membrane roof cap can be used.  If you are unsure about different materials that could meet the requirements, you can submit price quotations for both scenarios stating the advantages and disadvantages of each.   Q18. To meet the floor load requirements for forklift trucks an insulated concrete floor is required, is this acceptable? ANSWER 18. Yes but keep in mind we would like to be able to move the freezer if needed  The freezer we are currently renting to meet our immediate needs does not have a concrete floor, is portable, and can support a forklift on the inside.    Q19. Item #4a, the spec's indicate two (2) single hinged doors.  Should this be a triple hinged door. ANSWER 19. The purpose of this requirement is to have two doors that fully open to allow 7½' width (minimum) by 8' height (minimum) clearance.  This will allow a forklift to enter.   Q20. Will the refrigeration system be Hermetic, Semi-Hermetic, or others...? ANSWER 20. The freezer should be hermetic.  The purpose of this freezer is to store batteries.  In the rare instance if a leak should occur, we like for it to be isolated the freezer.  However, since this is not mentioned in the requirements, feel free to submit two versions of the quote with itemized prices for each of the styles.    Q21. For Item #22 Bid Submittals, can the submittals be sent by fax after bid opening? Answer 21. Request For Quotes System requires all companies to submit quotes electronically.    The due date for receipt of offers is not extended. Companies shall provide the information stated in the synopsis/RFQ posted on the NASA Acquisition Internet Service (NAIS) on 7/23/2002. Documents related to this procurement are available over the Internet and are in Microsoft Office 97 format and reside on the World Wide Web (WWW) server which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

<DESC>This announcement is notification of the refreshing standing Solicitation Number FCGS-X6-98-0273-N covering Federal Supply Schedule 66, Part II, Section Q ? Geophysical, Environmental Analysis Equipment And Services: Class 6655 ? Geophysical Instruments, Class 6675 ? Surveying Equipment, Class 6655 & 6660 ? Geophysical & Meteorological Instruments & Data Collection, Class 6625 ? Noise Measuring Instruments, Class 6630 & 6640 ? Liquid & Gas Analysis Equipment, Class 6665 ? Hazard Detection Equipment.  This standing solicitation allows vendors to submit offers at anytime.  There shall be no closing date for receipt of offers under this solicitation.  This Solicitation is being refreshed to include new and updated clauses pertaining to the Multiple Schedule Program.  The Solicitation can be downloaded  from the Internet at http://www.eps.gov.  The new term ?Evergreen  Contracting? option periods has been added to this Solicitation.  Evergreen contracts provides new policies and procedures to expand the multiyear contracts for all Multiple Award Schedules (MAS) Federal Supply Schedules to one 5 year basic contract period and three separate 5 year option periods. The Contracting Officer may exercise the option to extend the contract for an additional three five (5) years, by providing a written notice to the contractor at least 150 days in advance prior to the expiration of the contract period.  When the Government exercises its option to extend the term of this contract, option prices must be determined fair and reasonable at the time the option is exercised.  The Contracting Officer will obtain a contractor statement that the basis of award customer/Most Favored Customer (MFC) has remained the same and that pricing information provided to negotiate the contract, as updated through any modifications, has not changed unless an adjustment is made in accordance with another contract clause (e.g., Economic Price Adjustment Clause or Price Reduction Clause).  Current contractors are not required to submit an offer under this solicitation issuance.  Contracts awarded under this solicitation will have a contract period beginning on the date of award and will last for a five (5) year period, unless extended under the Evergreen option period, canceled or terminated.

All vendors and/current contractors should be aware that the Evergreen Contracting option period can not be exercised if your items offered are not on the GSA Advantage Electronic Pricelist.   This solicitation has been prepared in accordance with FAR Part 12, Acquisition of Commercial Items, which implement Title VIII of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act (FASA) of 1994 (Public Law 103-355), the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-106), and the final rule, published as General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) Change 76, regarding commercial item acquisitions under the Multiple Award Schedule Program.  The contract format and data requirements in this solicitation differ from previous solicitations.  Offerors are strongly encouraged to carefully review the entire solicitation package before submission to ensure compliance with commercial item provisions. Contractors are now required to accept the Government purchase card for payments equal to or less than the micro-purchase threshold for oral and written delivery orders.  Contractors are encouraged to accept the Government purchase card for payment for orders above the micro-purchase threshold.  See GSAR Clause 552.232.77, entitled ?Purchase by Credit Card?. This solicitation contains the new clause ?Contractor?s Report of Sales? (552.238-74), which requires the submission of sales on electronic GSA Form 72A via the Internet and ?Industrial Funding Fee? (IFF) (552.238-76) which requires a 1% payment due on a calendar quarter schedule.  Offerors must include the IFF in their prices.  The fee is included in the award price(s) and reflected in the total amount charged to ordering activities.  GSA has established a contract sales criterion for all Multiple Award Schedules.  Clause I-FSS-639, entitled ?Contract Sales Criteria?, states that a contract will not be awarded if the anticipated sales are not expected to exceed $25,000.  Contracts will also be canceled unless reported sales for each 12-month period from date of award are $25,000 or above.  This Federal Supply Schedule will no longer have a prescribed beginning and ending date.  The schedule period will be continuous, and will contain contracts with contract periods that commence on the date of award (DOA) and expire five years (exclusion of any options) from the DOA.  Unless otherwise noted in the solicitation, new offers may be forwarded at any time.  All requests for a diskette or hard copy of the solicitation should be faxed to (703) 305-5537, attention: Linda N. Poole.

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to extend the response date for the combined synopsis/solicitation number N68936-02-T-0209 that was issued on 17 July for the procurement on a competitive basis for two Telemetry Source Selectors.  The following changes and information is provided.  Response date is changed to 12 August 2002.  Time of Delivery is changed to read:  no later than 90 days after receipt of order (ARO).  Correct the reference to "FSTU" to read "FSVU" which stands for Frame Synchronizer Verification Unit.  This is a monitoring device that tells the Operator if the Best Source Selector is receiving telemetry data that is frame synchronized.  The government is seeking a commercial off-the-shelf product and will not provide drawings or a detailed specification.  For clarification purposes.  The telemetry source selector is a 24 input clock and data signals at TTL levels.  When a signal is lost the circuit should select the strongest signal to be determined by the signal with the best frame sync.  Some signal delay due to source location is expected, but if the signals are stored in a buffer, the delay and cutover will not be noticeable to the end user.  Maximum delay 20 millisecond.   If a signal is lost, the circuit should pick the next best signal base on which the best frame sync. chosen from a predetermined hierarchy.  If the signals are stored in a buffer, and one signal drops out, the circuit should be able to switch to another source within less than 20 milliseconds.  There is no need to connect an input to more than one output.  The phase of the Input Clock is normal.  The information to be presented on the RS422 ports should be system status display using best practice, using 10BaseT to control and program the device.  Displays are government-owned equipment.  The Source Selectors need to have the means so that software updates can be made.  The government prefers the use of a CDROM drive so that updates can be installed without sending the units to a factory.  A PCI CDROM would be sufficient.  The maximum bit rate is 20Mbit/sec.  and the minimum bit rate is 1 bit/sec; there is a requirement to capture information relating to the switching events, which indicates cause and time to correct; the class of IRIG-106 format being tested is of a constant length; some indication on the unit showing status of the device is needed; no PCM bit synchronizer of each input is being procured.  Quotations may be submitted via electronic mail to hallbj@navair.navy.mil or by fax at (760) 939-8329.  The POC for this requirement is Barbara J. Hall, Contract Specialist, at (760) 939-1064.  All responsible sources may submit a quotation, which shall be considered by the agency.  If you have submitted a previous proposal for this solicitation, please verify in writing or via email that your proposal is still valid.  The Government is considering the Government Purchase Card as a pay method.

<DESC>The following question has been posted for review.  Question:  Are you looking for the ability to define (1) realistic missions that will exercise the distributed controller algorithms, (2) new tactics for missions such as SEAD or TCT that are specific to distributed controllers, or (3) the ability of the distributed controller to generate tasks that require minimal operator involvement?  Answer:  Items 1 and 3 certainly apply to the DCAT program.  The proposed mission should represent a realistic set of tasks for the team.  Additionally, these tasks should be achievable with minimal operator involvement.  The development of new tactics was not given as a goal of the DCAT program.

<DESC>The United States Air Forces in Europe is attempting to determine the feasibility of contracting out the mail and parcel sorting operation currently located at Royal Air Force Base (RAF) Alconbury.  This is a sources sought synopsis to determine industry interest and a request for rough order magnitude estimates.  It in no way binds the Government or any respondents.  This effort is for sorting and loading/unloading of delivery trucks only.  The current 7-day a week, approximately 12 hours per day operation, employs approximately 20 personnel and moves an average of 1,212 pieces (36,000 US pounds) of mail daily including parcels.  During the Christmas season, mid November-mid January, this increases to an average of 2,963 pieces (89,000 US pounds) daily.  Occasionally during military contingencies, the mail volume may increase an additional 500 pieces (15,000 US pounds).   

In addition, an average of 221 pieces of registered mail are moved per month and require a separate secure sorting/storage room with office space for 2 personnel.  The personnel working registered mail must be US citizens with US SECRET clearances.  Operations would require a hard-sided, lockable and sealable vehicle to transport registered mail. 
Also, the operation uses a computer system to generate various reports showing the volume of mail processed and status of mail movement.  The computer system used to scan, track, and sort the mail, communicates with the United States Postal Service computer system.
 
There are established transportation contracts for delivery of the mail throughout the UK.  Trucks deliver the mail to the AMT from 8 locations, including mail incoming from the US and other worldwide locations via air.  Mail is sorted for delivery via the 8 delivery routes.  All mail is sorted and distributed to the delivery trucks within 12 hours.  The trucks deliver the mail to their stops within 24 hours. During times when the mail volume increases, additional trucks (up to 3 or more) are used to distribute the mail.  Outgoing mail is tagged, sorted by destination, counted, and weighed before turnover to the air carriers.  The pieces and weight are verified before the carrier loads it onto the aircraft.  Additionally, the contractor will be responsible to coordinate with the Mail Control Activity, on outgoing aircraft, to optimize volume/weight of mail being sent to the US.
 
Assuming you are interested in providing this service, do you have a facility in or around the London/RAF Alconbury area, and/or the equipment/capability to perform this work?  If so, where would you anticipate performing the work, and what would be the rough cost per year in US dollars ($):  

Less than $2M, 
$2M to $5M, 
$5M to $8M, 
$8M to $10M, or
Over $10M.

If you do not have existing facilities and/or the equipment in or around the London/RAF Alconbury area to perform this work, and had to establish (lease/purchase) the infrastructure, what would be the rough cost per year in US dollars ($)?


Less than $2M, 
$2M to $5M, 
$5M to $8M, 
$8M to $10M, or
Over $10M.

If the US Government were to provide a facility and equipment, what would be the rough cost per year in US dollars ($)?

Less than $2M, 
$2M to $5M, 
$5M to $8M, 
$8M to $10M, or
Over $10M.

The US Air Force is merely attempting to determine the feasibility of having a contractor perform this service.  After the responses from industry are evaluated, a decision whether to proceed with contracting out this activity will be made.  Only after such decision would the normal contracting process begin. 

Request that all interested parties submit their response no later than August 30, 2002.

<SUBJECT>Intent to issue a sole source contract
<DESC>DOE/NETL plans to issue a sole source contract for the development of a hollow sphere dual-gradient drilling system to Maurer Technology, Inc. Maurer has assembled a unique consortium of industrial partners consisting of oil field operators, oil field service companies, drilling contractors and national oil companies interested in supporting research for a new hollow sphere dual-gradient drilling (DGD) system.  This effort provides a unique opportunity to acquire the data associated with this hollow sphere DGD system.  The DGD information that will result from this effort will give DOE a comparative database which can be used for planning and evaluation of current and future research activities related to conventional offshore drilling.  DOE believes that Maurer is the only source possessing the necessary expertise and plans to award a sole source contract to Maurer in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Part 6.302-1 -- Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements.  Please note that this is NOT a Request for Proposals (RFP) and NO solicitation will be issued as a result of this notice.

<SUBJECT>A -- Prognosis Bidder''s Conference
<DESC>Prognosis Bidder?s Conference SN02-23.  The Defense Sciences Office (DSO) of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is sponsoring a conference on Prognosis for Combat Asset Readiness.  This conference will be held September 26-27, 2002, at the Radisson Hotel Old Town in Alexandria, VA.  DARPA is interested in exploring basic research efforts to develop core technologies that will provide revolutionary and transformational capability to US Forces.  The aim of the conference is to make the community aware of DARPA?s interest in prognostic technologies and methodologies for (near) real time asset capability prediction with specific emphasis on materials and structures.  It is intended that this conference provide a forum for interested parties to explore potential teaming opportunities in order to facilitate the preparation of white papers and/or proposals that may be requested under a DARPA Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) that is under consideration.  The specific objective of the Prognosis program is to go beyond existing condition-based maintenance, prognostic health management, or life extension programs and to establish predictive capability far beyond failure prediction.  It is the intention of this program to provide commanders with the tools and quantitative predictions to adaptively manage, deploy, and use combat systems/platforms to the limit of their current and future capability.  Thus, this will enable their full integration into the warfighters? evolving network-centric plan.  Technical areas of interest include, but are not limited to: (1) advanced sensor technologies and interrogation tools capable of real time sub-critical flaw detection, assessing evolving damage, and deleterious microstructural changes; (2) beyond state-of-the-art physics of failure methods for predicting evolution of damage from multiple and coupled damage mechanisms; (3) mathematical constructs relating the physics-of-failure mechanisms to realistic capability predictions with known ranges of uncertainty; (4) global system or subsystem signature deconvolution algorithms for detecting and localizing damage; and (5) real time and hierarchical reasoners and an operational, user-functional and error tolerant architecture capable of integrating various sensor data with failure progression model predictions. The conference will consist of presentations from DARPA and other Government agencies that have interest in this area.  Conference participants will have the opportunity to ask questions regarding DARPA?s and the Services? vision and plans.  Interested parties unable to attend the meeting are encouraged to submit their questions via e-mail at SN02-23@darpa.mil.  All questions and answers will be posted on the meeting website. In addition, there will be a poster session to facilitate interaction and team forming amongst the participants.  The session will be limited to 30 poster presentations, with size restrictions for each poster of 4 feet by 4 feet.  Potential bidders are strongly encouraged to prepare posters.  Poster presenters will be required to submit a short abstract describing areas of capabilities and interest in order to stimulate communications, interactions, and team prospecting.  The abstracts will be printed in a booklet given out to all attendees at the conference.  To sign up for a poster presentation slot, attendees must submit their poster abstract when they register on-line on the conference website.  Only the first 30 registrants to submit abstracts will be granted a poster presentation slot.  Attendees must register in advance on-line at  http://www.eventmakeronline.com/dso/View/index.asp?MeetingID=128.  Conference details can be found at this website, including hotel information, directions, agenda, registration fee and registration form.  Registration cutoff is September 16, 2002, or at attendance capacity.  Space is limited and it is recommended that you register early.  For further administrative information contact Heather Heigele (SN02-23@darpa.mil).  Please refer to the "Prognosis Conference" in correspondence.

<SUBJECT>A -- Calibration Measurements for L-Band Organic GMTI Radar proof of concept system
<DESC>DARPA intends to enter into a contract with Syracuse Research Corp. (SRC) to perform calibration measurements of the L-Band Organic GMTI Radar (OGR) proof-of-concept system.  The calibration parameters to be measured will be range and angular accuracy, as well as absolute range and angular calibration.  The range and angular accuracy measurements will put a tolerance on all of the measurements made with the radar.  The tolerance is established by analysis of the system parameters.  This anaylysis is then verified with measured test target data.  The purpose of the absolute range and angular calibration is to remove system biases found in all target measurements.  Anlysis of these returns will determine what the correct range and angular calibration values are. Because Syracuse Research Corp. developed the L-Band OGR under a previous Government contract, the company is uniquely familiar with the system and best qualified to perform the necessary calibration tasks.  Furthermore, the system is currently in possession of SRC.  Transfering the system to another vendor to perform the calibration would be cost ineffective.  This notice is published for informational purposes only.  This notice is not a Request for Proposals (RFP).  Contractors capable of offering their service must respond within 15 days of the date of this notice by submitting a specific capability statement to provide the service.  All responses received within 15 days after publication of this notice will be considered bu the Government solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.  The solicitation number is R36-7MN1-02 and is issued as a request for quotation (RFQ).  This solicitation is a small business set-aside;  The NAICS is 334516, business size 500 employees.  This solicitation document incorporates those provisions and clauses in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular 01-08.  The USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Southern Plains Agricultural Research Center, Areawide Pest Management Research Unit, requests the procurement of one Spray Characterization System.  As part of the research mission of the Aerial Application Technology group in the Areawide Pest Management Research Unit, we conduct research related to the effects of spray atomizers, spray formulations, and other physical properties on droplet sizes and droplet size distributions that occur in the aerial application of crop protection materials.  The research objectives are to maximize product efficacy without unintended impact on the environment, such as drift.  As new atomizers and crop protection materials are developed through our research and/or introduced by commercial entities, we must be able to fully understand the droplet characteristics that are being produced under various aerial application conditions.  The droplet size and droplet size distribution being produced by a particular atomizer and spray solution combination is used to predict and measure where droplets will deposit once that are released from the aircraft.  We are interested in being able to analyze the effects of various atomizer designs on droplet velocities to help predict where the droplet will ultimately deposit.   Minimum requirements include: 1) Fully characterize droplet sizes within the spray plume and the droplet size distribution of the entire spray plume;  2) Droplet velocity within the spray plume; 3) Provide both numerical and visual assessments of the spray characteristics within the plume; 4) All software and computing resources; 5) The system must operate in an outdoor environment with minimal access to laboratory space;  6) The system should not require any shielding from water, dust, or chemical contaminates that would require obstruction or interference of the air stream.  7) The system must be able to characterize a spray plume that is developed in a 60-150 mph (25-70 m/s) air stream and generates droplets from 15-1000  m in size.  8) Specify warranty type and duration.  The contractor shall perform all delivery, set-up and training so that the Spray Characterization System is complete and ready to use.
