This solicitation is specifically concerned with ideas that project innovation beyond the range of research traditionally supported through the NIH investigator-initiated research support process.  NIAAA anticipates awarding a total of 2-3 contracts, based on technical merit, available funds, and programmatic balance.  Solicitation documents may be obtained electronically from the FedBizOpps; hardcopy documents may be obtained by writing (facsimile [301-443-3891] and email [tcrilley@niaaa.nih.gov] requests are acceptable) to the NIAAA Contracts Management Branch, Willco Building, Suite 504, 6000 Executive Boulevard, MSC 7003, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7003.

<DESC>Operational Contracting, US Air Force Academy intends to award a sole source purchase order utilizing simplified acquisition procedures to Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), 380 New York Street, Redlands, CA  92373 for purchase of an Academic Software Site License.

The following are primary reasons for this sole source procurement, for which only one responsible source will satisfy the Air Force Academy’s requirement:

a.  The Geospatial Information System section within the 10th Civil Engineer Group has been using ESRI software since their initial development five years ago.  All of the new mapping and client specific applications have been developed using the ESRI line of software products.  In addition, all current applications under contract are being accomplished using ESRI software. 

b.  The Dean of Faculty’s Geography Department also uses the current ESRI Academic Site License for teaching all Geographical Information System coursework to the Cadets.  In addition, they also develop specific GIS client applications in support of Cadet coursework and other GIS users on the Academy.  

c.  Software standardization between the 10 Civil Engineer Group, DFEG, and the entire USAF Academy is extremely critical.  Compatibility of software allows GIS data sharing between all agencies on the Academy, and will continue to support GIS development in the future.

d.	The Air Force Civil Engineering Automated Strategic Plan states, “Geospatial Information Systems software must be compatible with all DOD Federal and Non-Federal agencies.”  The software included in this Site License meets this requirement. 

Award of this contract to another company will jeopardize the performance of our mission by making all our existing GIS data non-usable.

 Supplies and/or services are available from only one responsible source.   No other type of supply or service will satisfy agency requirements.  Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to meet this requirement.  This Notice of Intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  If no response is received by September 22, 2004 to the effect that comparable supplies and/or services are available that would be more advantageous to the Government than obtaining these supplies and or services though a sole source procurement with Environmental Systems Research Institute a sole source award will be made.

The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, intends to purchase the following item:  Qty 6:  4001 Type E NTDS 2-Lug VME card W/O Signal Gnd to J1 & J2 PN:  530-2005-006 Serial Communications interface cards.  The ship/Submarine Environment and Missile Simulation (SEMS) is a test bed for the Tactical TOMAHAWK Weapons Control Systems (TTWCS) and consists of multiple launch platform and missile simulations with the Land Attack Systems Integration Laboratory (LASIL).  These simulations have been operational since Version 1 was originally developed in 1996 and they communicate to the TTWCS using VME based interface cards.  Two of the interfaces utilize specifically the Titan/Visicom 4001 Type E NTDS VME card and utilize existing on-site developed software to communicate with this card.  The current requirement necessitates the replication of the existing interfaces using existing computer programs. The sole source nature of this procurement is to maintain compatibility w! ith the interface requirements and existing hardware currently operating within the SEMS environment. Any other Type E NTDS interface boards will require significant modification of the computer source code and custom cables for each implementation of the alternative boards. Additionally, as part of our test environment, it is necessary to match the interface hardware being used by the TTWCS and the US TTWCS is using the Titan/Visicom Type E NTDS interface boards. These interface cards will be acquired utilizing Simplified Acquisition Procedures in accordance with FAR Part 13.  The closing date will be 20 September 2004 with an anticipated award date of 24 September 2004.  All items will be priced FOB-Destination, Dahlgren, Virginia.

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0077.  The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for activities in the southern area of the State of Texas managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations - Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and outlying airfields, Naval Air Station Kingsville and outlying airfields, and Naval Station Ingleside.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million.  Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range.  This procurement will include potential set-asides for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include-Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation- including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8a or HUBZone contractor, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8a or HUBZONE contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 30 January 2004.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official planholders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.  Amendment will be posted on the web site for downloading.  This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.

<CONTACT>Audrey Winters Contract Specialist 3039692053     Audrey_Winters@nps.gov;
<DESC>The National Park Service (NPS), Department of Interior, is conducting a pre-solicitation site visit for the deconstruction, demolition, and steel piling installation project for the new Northwest Arctic Heritage Center (Visitor Center), Western Arctic National Parklands, in Kotzebue, Alaska. The NPS will be soliciting proposals in early 2005 for construction firms having the capability to perform the work described below. Funding is currently unavailable but pending Congressional approval for 2005.  It is anticipated that this project will be advertised in January 2005 and that it will be a competitive 8(a) solicitation. In order that interested parties may have a chance to visit the site before inclement weather, a Pre-Solicitation Site Visit is scheduled on Wednesday, October 13, 2004.  All interested parties are to meet at the former native corporation multipurpose building, which is located at the intersection of 2nd and 3rd Avenues (171 3rd Avenue), within walking distance of the airport, at 12:15 pm on October 13, 2004.  Access to the existing building is restricted.  Attendees will be escorted through the facility.  Accordingly, to reserve a space for this site visit, all interested parties must contact Audrey Winters, Contract Specialist, at (303) 969-2053; email Audrey_Winters@nps.gov by October 8, 2004.  It is anticipated that a draft copy of the deconstruction, demolition, and pile installation construction drawings for the Northwest Arctic Heritage Center will be made available on or about October 6, 2004, at the Denver Service Center new public FTP server. The project files will be available in the WEAR folder.  An amendment to this announcement will be issued when the drawings are available.  This is a public FTP server meaning NPS staff, cooperators and contractors located outside the NPS computer network can access the site. No anonymous FTP connections are allowed. Therefore, uploading and downloading of data requires a username and password. Users must log on to the FTP server to download and upload files. No anonymous FTP access is allowed.  The Denver Service Center assumes no responsibility for the usage of this server.      Public FTP Site address:    ftp://63.220.43.40     Username (UPDATED):     npsftpwin     Password (UPDATED and case-sensitive):   FTP04npswin  (Please note: it is a zero.)   All questions and answers presented at the pre-solicitation site visit will be included in the final drawings, specifications, attachments, and/or amendments.  The title of this project is: Northwest Arctic Heritage Center - Deconstruction, Demolition, and Steel Piling Installation. The anticipated start date for the construction activities is March 2005.  The scope of work for this project consists of deconstructing the existing multipurpose building for the purpose of salvaging reusable materials, demolishing the remainder of the building and installing refrigerated steel pilings.  This project is to be completed in anticipation of a separate construction contract for a new facility that is intended to be awarded later in 2005 and initiated in 2006 consisting of finish site work, the Heritage Center building, and a new maintenance building. A negotiated firm-fixed price contract will be awarded requiring submission of both a technical and a price proposal. Technical capability will include, but not limited to, experience in working in logistically challenging remote locations with short construction seasons.  Estimated price range for the deconstruction, demolition and steel piling installation project is between $1,000,000 and $3,000,000. Time for completion is 90 calendar days.

<DESC>NASA/HQ plans to issue a Request for Quote for the following Commercial item/services: Computer equipment and peripherals required to complete the installation of a video/imagery/data application. This requirement is only for the computer equipment and peripherals; not for the installation.  The system encompasses a Tandberg video conferencing system and an HP Win2000 based data system utilizing Stereoscopic stereo display monitors. The desktop application will utilize Remote View software to display and manipulate video imagery files. The system will be deployed at Headquarters and three Space Flight Centers. The entire configuration is based on commercial off the shelf legacy technology that has been adapted for NASA's video/imagery/data Return to Flight requirement.   It is imperative that offerors understand that most of the components that NASA requires constitute “old” technology.  New components will NOT work on this particular project.  Offerors must propose on the items exactly as solicited without offering a “better”, more advanced technology; even if the advanced technology is less expensive. The Government intends to award a single contract; however, NASA reserves the right to make multiple awards for less than the full quantities stated in the solicitation if it is advantageous from a price standpoint.  All proposals will be evaluated on a fixed price basis and award will be based on price competition. The anticipated release date of RFQ84261HBK is on or about September 22, 2004 with an anticipated quote due date of on or about September 29, 2004. All responsible sources may submit a quote which shall be considered by the agency. An ombudsman has been appointed. See NASA Specific Note "B". The solicitation and any documents related to this procurement will be available over the Internet. These documents will reside on a World-Wide Web (WWW) server, which may be accessed using a WWW browser application.

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION:Ultra-Sensitive Detectors___________

A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

A. INTRODUCTION
__________
The Department Of Defense (DOD) is interested in receiving proposals for very high frame rate, high bandwidth, low noise detection systems for applications in laser ranging and detection.  The delivered system will consist of a detector, associated electronics needed to amplify and digitize the detector signal, cooling hardware, and documentation.  The program will consist of three possibly overlapping phases for a total of 36 months: 
____________
Phase 1 will span 12 months, and contractors are encouraged to demonstrate key elements of their technical approach such as system gain or read out noise that contributes to their system’s high sensitivity.  This elemental performance should be combined with detailed modeling to illustrate the contractor’s technical approach will meet the program’s detection goals. We would expect that a phase-ending CDR would produce a camera design that the contractor expects could meet the specification goals.
____________
Phase 2 will cover fabrication of the detector and multiplexer units into a hybridized detection system in 18 months. 
____________
Phase 3 will cover final design documentation, integration, testing and delivery within a 6-month period to a Government facility of the complete detection system that meets all technical performance listed herein.  
___________
The Government anticipates awarding at most two contracts for this effort during phase 1, with a down select for phase 2 and 3.  The anticipated magnitude of effort for this project is approximately $2.5M per year over 3 years but this amount is neither guaranteed nor is the Government obligated to meet this budget in the future.  The projected start date is anticipated to  be during the second quarter FY05 but is dependent upon availability of funding and the results of the contracting process.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), Dr. Jim Riker, at 808-874-1619, is encouraged until proposals are received.  Contracting questions should be directed to Capt Dax Presuto at 505-846-0758 or dax.presuto@kirtland.af.mil.  
___________
B.	TECHNICAL TOPIC AREA:
Contractors funded under this Ultra-Sensitive Detector (USD) development program will use modeling and simulation, analysis, design, experimentation, and testing to develop, fabricate, demonstrate and deliver a high frame rate (10 kHz), high bandwidth (>1 GHz), low noise (<1-photon per pixel per frame Noise Equivalent Input (NEI)) to the DOD.  Emphasis will be placed on system architectures that are favorable in terms of size, weight, affordability, and reliability while trying to meet the program technical performance goals.  The contractor is expected to address these issues both in the proposal and throughout program execution if a proposal is requested via BAA.
____________
The applications we envision for this detection system development include laser ranging and detection of targets, with as much information as possible provided from the image processor to assist in target identification.  Laser ranging means placing a laser on a distant target and resolving the return pulse in the detector output and being able to resolve depth characteristics to a resolution of 20 cm or less (350 psec).  Our intent is to be able to do this in an array format, with at least 4 x 4 pixels used to sense the return at the highest temporal resolution.  This effort will push the state-of-the-art in 3D imaging (angle-angle-range) at the highest sensitivity yet demonstrated.  The approach should show scaling to larger array formats.  
___________
The Government expects to do the ranging, detection, and identification functions outside of the FPA.  In order to accomplish that, we need the detector to have certain capabilities in terms of noise performance, array readout times (frame rates), pixel readout times (bandwidth), etc.  We do not expect the detector developer to have to consider system-related issues such as where the laser source is located, where any “targets” are located, or whether the laser and detector share the same optics.  However, because of system issues like shared aperture operations with lasers and cameras, we have a specification on image persistence.
____________
MIT/LL has developed Geiger Mode Arrays using InGaAs responsive in the desired wavelength region (1.0-1.7 microns). These devices, which are still in development, should emulate their successful work with Silicon in a 32 by 32 format.  The limitations on the LL technology in meeting the government goals are that they are Geiger mode and typically have quench times of 100 ns per pixel.  The government believes that this technology can still meet the program goals specified below when the signal regime is limited to well below 1 photon per detection/pixel or the imaged spot encompasses multiple pixels.  Contractors are encouraged to consider the current state-of –the-art in the Lincoln Labs work and consider licensing it as a path to achieve the government’s detector/camera goals.  The government is looking for the best approach to achieve pixelized detection of single photons in a linear detection mode.
____________
The DOD is specifically interested in approaches that address the camera output performance requirements listed in the paragraphs below.  We have divided the specification into detector (or Focal Plane Array (FPA)) requirements, system performance requirements, functional requirements, packaging requirements, and documentation requirements.  The delivered detector system is to consist of the sensor FPA, associated electronics needed to amplify and digitize the sensor signal, electronics housing, cooling hardware, and documentation.  For large arrays, an electronic multiplexer to rapidly read out the full array or subsets of the array is desirable.  If the device has unique environmental issues, packaging appropriate to breadboard demonstration within a laboratory environment should be offered.  The number of ports should be compatible with the desired frame rate and bandwidth for the overall system.  
___________
FPA SPECIFICATION GOALS, in decreasing order of importance:
1)	Wavelength Response: The FPA shall detect near-infrared photons in the region 1.0-1.7 microns.  High quantum efficiency (>0.65 over the entire 1-1.7 micron range) is desirable to maximize the overall system performance.  Specific laser lines of interest for this program include the 1.029-m Yb:YAG line and the 1.064-m Nd:YAG line.
2)	Array Size: The FPA shall be produced in an array format for tracking, wave-front sensing, imaging, and scoring applications, with designs supporting array sizes of at least 4 x 4.  Scaling to larger sizes, up to 64x64, are considered a plus.  
3)	Bandwidth: The detector bandwidth shall exceed 1 GHz or a response time of at least 350 ps.  Electronics can be coupled directly to the detector pixels if necessary.  Our expectation is to be able to resolve individual laser pulses whose rise time is greater than about 350 ps and whose overall pulse-length exceeds 1 ns.  Depending on the ranging system geometry, signal levels, detector and read-out noise, off-chip processing algorithms, and other factors, we expect that this detector capability will provide range-resolution to below 20 cm.
4)	Pixel Pitch 60 microns or greater. 
5)	Pixel Well Size: The detector shall have a well size adequate to support 11 bits of corrected dynamic range with the specified noise level, to permit operations in scintillated laser environments.
6)	Pixel Fill: The pixel fill factor shall be greater than 80%, meaning that at least 80% of the Focal Plane Array (FPA) area is to respond to light.  This requirement recognizes that certain technologies, such as Avalanche Photo-Diodes (APD), may not be able to produce the desired 100% fill factor.  But detectors that can match the other requirements while achieving 100% fill factor will be considered a plus.  Micro-lens arrays or other separate optics integrated with the detector elements are an acceptable approach to achieve the required fill factors and are encouraged to minimize radiation response should these devices ever be applied in radiation rich environments.
7)	Gain Non-uniformity: The non-uniformity in gain from pixel to pixel shall be less than 10% of full scale when the detector is operated at its maximum rate for a 20-microsecond integration.  Non-uniformity across a single pixel shall be less than 5% on the part of the array that is responsive.
8)	Offset (or Bias) Drift: The digitized offset drift shall be less than twice the median noise level over a period of 3 minutes, in order to facilitate stable calibration and use.
9)	FPA Operation: The FPA shall operate under simultaneous (or snapshot) integration.  This mode of operation refers to simultaneously integrating and resetting all pixels together, as opposed to a rolling integration where some pixels are reset while others are integrating.
10)	 Multiple modes of engagement should be offered in the signal processing software and hardware.  100 bins covering a maximum of 10 microseconds should form one limit while the other limiting mode should strive for 100 or more bins within 20 nanoseconds.  
11)	As suggested the device should be able to detect minimum signal levels below 1 photon and maximum signal levels to 10,000 photons.  In addition the device should not be damaged with incident signal levels of up to a 1000 times higher and should recover from such incidence within 80 microseconds.
_____________
DETECTION SYSTEM SPECIFICATION GOALS, in decreasing order of importance:
1)	Noise Equivalent Input (NEI): The overall system noise performance shall be less than 0.4 photons per frame per pixel RMS, at a wavelength of 1064 nm as measured and averaged over a 20 micro-second exposure gate.  The noise value quoted here represents all noise sources.
2)	Frame Rate: The frame rate is defined as the inverse of the sum of the integration time, read-out time, and dead time (defined below).  The system shall have a frame rate that is at least 10 kHz.
3)	Integration Time: The time during which the camera will integrate charge is within the range 0.3 ns to 20 microseconds.  The integration is to be controlled by the user with a single differential control line, and the system should be able to integrate while reading out.  The duration of the integration time must be capable of being set by the user through software inputs.  It is recommended that at least three discrete time modes are offered, and more flexibility would be a plus.  The rise time of the integration shall be less than 350 ps from the 10% to 90% points.  The fall time should be the same.  The frame-to-frame temporal response uncertainty of the camera integration gate with respect to a 1-ns rise-time step synchronization trigger shall be less than 1 ns.  The residual charge after a camera clear command shall be less than ½ the NEI.
4)	Frame Readout Time: The time for a complete read-out of the full array shall be less than 100 ms.  
5)	Dead Time: The delay between the integration period and the readout period shall be less than 35 ns.  
6)	Dynamic Range: The output data shall have a dynamic range after correction of 11 bits.  That is, the dynamic range after correction for offset and gain is to be greater than 2048:1.
7)	Non-Uniformity Correction: Pixel non-uniformities shall be correctable with linear two-point gain-offset Non-Uniformity Correction (NUC) algorithms to better than 1%.  After correction, the camera response should be linear to better than 2% when measured as the maximum deviation from the best linear fit over the full dynamic range.
8)	Cross-talk: The cross-talk due to all processes as measured in the recorded frame shall be such that less than 5% of the electrons are collected in the adjacent pixel when the light falls within 2 microns of the edge.  The cross-talk shall be less than 0.5% for non-adjacent pixels.
9)	Operability: After corrections for offset and gain, 95% of the pixels shall meet or exceed the specification for linearity, dynamic range, and noise.  At least 99.8% of the pixels shall be within 50% of the specification for linearity, dynamic range, and noise.  In wave-front sensor mode, 100% of the read out pixels shall be operable.
10)	Image Persistence: Subsequent frame latent images shall be less than 1% of the original frame.  Charge generated during the reset period shall be reduced to 1 part in 10,000 within 80 micro-seconds of generation.
___________
SYSTEM FUNCTIONS SET BY USER:
1)	Frame Start: The start of the frame shall be synchronized to an externally provided trigger.
2)	Sub-array Row/Column Placement: The user shall specify the sub-framing of the array by identifying the upper and left-most sub-frame pixel and the number of rows and columns within the sub-frame.
3)	The integration duration of the sensor is to be controllable in the range 20 ns to 20 microseconds in discreet modes or continuously.  It is to integrate photon input during this period.  Prior to the integration period, photo-induced electrons are not to be integrated.  Following the integration, readout should take place within 35 ns.
_________
PACKAGE GOALS, in decreasing order of importance:

The package is desired to be applicable to a laboratory environment, maintenance-free (yet with accessibility for repairs), and protective of sensitive components, cables, and cooling lines.  All cables are to be properly stress-relieved.  All cooling accessories needed for detector operability shall be provided with the system.

1)	Operating Temperature: The system must meet specifications at a temperature of 240-K or greater.  This specification should be interpreted to mean that we desire Thermo-Electric Cooling of the camera system, as opposed to cryogenic coolers.
2)	Field Of View (FOV) of Detector Package Assembly: To facilitate high-magnification optical systems, the FOV shall exceed 66 degrees.
3)	Mechanical Interface: The FPA/read-out electronics shall have a standard interface.  The cable length from the FPA to the electronics shall be greater than 2 feet.  The detector housing shall have a flat base mounting plate.  The detection system shall be able to fit within a 25-cm by 25-cm square area.  
4)	Detector Head Cooling: Cold-air cooling (at 15 SCFM and less than 45 degrees F) of the detector head is preferred, but water-jacket cooled versions of the system are also of interest.
5)	Detector Output: the output shall be differential digital from the detector head to the processing electronics.  Timing signals to and from the detector should use 50-ohm single-ended BNC connections.
6)	Initial Alignment Fiducial: A fiducial indicating detector position relative to the detector housing shall be provided for the initial alignment of the optical system.
____________
Documentation required if BAA is Released:

In addition to the deliverables called out in the BAA, the following specific documents are required:

1)	System description
2)	Operating instructions
3)	Required power, grounding, external signals, cooling, environmental with maximum and minimum ratings
4)	Trouble-shooting guide with accessible test points
5)	Electrical schematic
6)	Mechanical schematic
7)	Acceptance measurements results with a short description of the test procedures.  At a minimum, we expect that the contractor would supply photon transfer curves, spot scan measurements, temporal response measurements, and quantum efficiency data.

The contractor shall discuss in the proposal how to measure the system performance, using standard metrics such as responsivity, detectivity, noise equivalent power (or irradiance), or D-star.  The contractor must also define and discuss how measurements will be made to prove performance on the set of requirements listed above.  Finally, the contractor should include some discussion of the test facilities needed and available to make these measurements.

RFI TECHNICAL INFORMATION: Advanced Diagnostics
___________
A. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

1.0  BACKGROUND:

The need for advanced diagnostics has been identified as a major obstacle to understanding the operational dynamics of chemical lasers and COILs in particular.  This RFI intends to attain industry information on the viability of releasing a BAA that will seek proposals for creating diagnostics with the objective of filling recognized gaps in the instrumentation of current laser devices. Diagnostics are needed for types of measurements in 2.1 and 2.2 below.
___________
2.0  REQUIREMENTS:

2.1  Measurement of oxygen species.  The molecular oxygen species to be detected include O2(X3S), O2(a1D), and O2(b1S).  Diagnostics proposed under this topic shall quantitatively measure at least two and preferably all three of these molecular species.  All measurements in the laser devices shall be made in situ during short duration (typically 10 sec) experiments.  Measuring the concentration at a rate of 25 Hz or better is preferred for time evolution studies; however, slower data rates will be considered.  Simultaneous measurement of the oxygen species is preferred; however, sequential measurement will be acceptable.  The offeror should assume that the optical path-length will not exceed five (5) cm, however, multi-pass configurations may be used to increase the effective path length.  The following table lists the minimum acceptable detection limits. 
Species	Number density (molecules cm-3)
	Threshold	Objective
O2(X3S)	1 x 1014	1 x 1013
O2(a1D)	1 x 1014	1 x 1013
O2(b1S)	1 x 1014	1 x 1013

______________
2.2  Measurement of molecular iodine.  Molecular iodine in its ground electronic state shall be measured with very high accuracy at low concentration.  Diagnostics proposed under this topic need to quantitatively measure iodine in situ during the short duration (typically 10 sec) experiments.  Measuring the concentration at a rate of 25 Hz or better is preferred for time evolution studies; however, slower data rates will be considered.  The offeror should assume that the optical path-length will not exceed five (5) cm, however, multi-pass configurations may be used to increase the effective pathlength. The following table lists the minimum acceptable detection limits: 
Species	Number density (molecules cm-3)
	Threshold	Objective
Iodine	1 x 1012	1 x 1011
____________
3.0  PROPOSED SCHEDULE:

The expected period of performance for this advanced diagnostics effort is approximately 7 months with the end product being delivery of the two diagnostic units. The intended program milestones are as follows: after 3 months of design work the contractor shall hold a technical interchange meeting with members from the ABL SPO and AFRL/DE.  The objective of this meeting is for the contractor to gain approval to continue with the current design.  After this meeting, there is a three-month period designated for fabrication of the hardware, integration and test, after which the prototype(s) are expected to be delivered. 
__________
The Government anticipates awarding one contract for each diagnostic effort, unless the same contractor can provide both.  The anticipated magnitude of effort for this project is approximately <$500K total, but this amount is neither guaranteed nor is the Government obligated to meet this budget in the future.  The projected start date is anticipated to be during the second quarter FY05 but is dependent upon availability of funding and the results of the contracting process.  Open communication with the technical point of contact (POC), 1Lt Heather Pietrzyk, at 808-853-3779 or heather.pietrzyk@kirtland.af.mil, is encouraged until proposals are received (if BAA is released).  Contracting questions should be directed to Capt Dax Presuto at 505-846-0758 or dax.presuto@kirtland.af.mil.  

__________________________________________________________________
SUGGESTED QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER:

Following are some specific questions and/or response guidelines for this RFI.  Contractors should freely make any other comments or suggestions on areas not discussed here.

1)	From both technical and programmatic viewpoints, does the contractor believe that the methodologies/requirements discussed above would provide a viable path to completion of the program objectives within the cost and schedule constraints specified? If not, please provide recommendations on how the program specification(s) could be improved.
2)	Are there any technical specifications that should be in the draft text that are not currently included?
3)	Is there anything in the current draft text that the contractor feels is unnecessary (technically or programmatically) or that is not clearly stated?
5)	Is the proposed funding profile adequate to successfully complete the one approach (or both approaches, if applicable) as outlined?  If not, please elaborate.
6)	What is a reasonable page limitation for a technical proposal volume (1 inch margins, 12 point proportional Times New Roman font for body of text, 10 point proportional font for figures and tables), including all pages from title sheet through appendices?
7)	In addition to responding to any of the above questions, the contractor may also offer any other comments or recommendations that it feels would improve a BAA and the proposed technical effort.

Responses to this RFI are due by 1 Oct 2004.

<DESC>Based on previous market research conducted by the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), the Agency proposes to award sole source contracts to ESEA and Northrop Grumman to develop conflation technology using their commercial off the shelf software as a baseline to better suit the specific production needs of NGA.  It is the desire that the deliverable product conflate mapping, charting, and geodesy data from one segment with the geospatial intelligence feature data from another segment. This is a technology that merges data to attain a "best of breed."  In addition to providing conflation software, the contractor will provide, as appropriate, licenses, training, technical support, and travel.  To satisfy NGA's minimum needs the following salient characteristics are identified:


The current set of requirements is directed at functionality that is essential for NGA's current and emerging conflation needs.  The requirements below are numbered for reference.  Numbers do not indicate priority.

Overall requirements
1	Ease of use is paramount.  The software should be intuitive and easy to learn.
2	Footprint is preferred to be lightweight to minimize software and hardware cost.
3	Ease of integration into production is critical.  The software should be flexible in its ingest and should have open interfaces.  
4	Processing speed is important.  Exact amounts of data and processing speeds are not established.
5	Scalability needs to be defined.  Memory requirements to handle larger datasets should be well defined so software does not bomb during operational use.
6	Defaults are needed when software includes tolerances or choices of algorithms.  The vendor should provide defaults, and should document the impact of changing tolerances or algorithms used.  It should be possible to kick off a default process with virtually no choices other than inputs.
7	Source metacontent must be available to the user for viewing, so the user can evaluate the currency, accuracy, resolution, etc. of both input sources at any point during processing.
8	Conflation of all feature geometries to all other geometries is required. It is acceptable that different geometries be conflated in different software runs, but the vendor should define workflows, since sequence of conflation tends to affect outcome.
9	Dynamic segmentation is required to match and deconflict portions of line features.
10	Conflation of more than two datasets is required (for example:  use aero source for all aero geometry and most attributes, add aero attributes from VMap2, pull in all other VMap2 cultural features, pull in DNC coastline and anything in the water).  However, it is acceptable to successively conflate pairs of datasets. If this approach is used, the vendor should provide guidance on the effect of processing sequence, and should recommend a processing sequence.  E.g., start with datasets containing the best geometries, add datasets with the best attributes, continue to lower quality datasets.
11	Ingest and output of VPF is required.*  
12	Dirty data must not be a barrier to the conflation process.*  
13	Population of metacontent must be possible at the dataset/session, feature, and attribute levels.  The precise metacontent requirements are not defined, so software should exhibit the capability of automatically generating and populating metacontent at these three levels.
14	Output of a log file is required.  The log file should describe the input datasets, commands, and output datasets.  The precise content requirements are not defined, so software should exhibit the capability of automatically generating a logfile of the information the vendor deems most useful.

Feature linking requirements
1	Powerful editing tools are needed for manual feature matching, since automated feature matching will seldom be 100% correct or complete.
2	Undo capability is required.  When a user performs interactive edits, it should be possible to undo at least 10 of the previous edits.
3	Iterative processing of automated and manual feature matching would be useful. Automated feature matching would never override manual edits, but would improve in each successive run because manual matches are removed from consideration. 
4	Quality assurance tools should provide for an entire dataset not just the matched features be reviewed by the user. 
5	Consideration of attribute values is required to improve feature matches.  It must be possible to define what would comprise a match (i.e., which attributes, and which values of the attributes).  It must also be possible to define what would NOT comprise a mismatch (i.e., if a value is NULL or unknown, it is neither a match nor a mismatch).
6	Consideration of elevation values is required to improve feature matches.

Deconfliction requirements
1	Use of source attributes in deconfliction rules is required.  For example, which source to use for geometry or attribute values could be based on source characteristics for different feature types on the same conflated result.  Source characteristics could include surveyed, stereo, mono, reported.  
2	Flexibility in populating the geometry of the conflated result is required.  It should be possible to include geometry from either source based on feature type, based on attributes (e.g., choose the more recent geometry), and whether it was matched or not.  It should also be possible to include connectivity vectors or not.
3	Quality assurance tools should automatically detect gaps, cross-overs and overshoots.  It should also be possible to specify rules to check the context of conflation results (i.e., did any building objects get repositioned into a body of water, or does a railroad now run through a mountain without benefit of a tunnel).
4	Creation of connectivity vectors to ensure a continuous network is required.  These should be optional.
5	Flexibility in defining the attributes of the conflated result is required. For example, the output schema could be a union of the input schemas, an intersection, a mixture of the two schemas, or a new schema altogether (with rules that map the source attributes to the target attributes).
6	Flexibility in populating the attributes of the conflation result is required.  For example, an output attribute could be populated by one of the other source, by a function of either source value, or by a rule (e.g., if source A's attribute is null, use source B's attribute).
7	Manual tools for populating attributes would be useful.  Some conflations are so complex that rules would be too unwieldy to develop.  For example, if a bridge represented by three spans on one source is conflated to a point feature on the output source, a user is best qualified to carry over the attributes to from the multiple spans to the point feature.
8	Flexibility in populating the elevations of the conflated result is required.  It must be possible to define the output geometry as a combination of the lat/long from one source and the elevation from the other.  Because portions of segments can match, this implies that the deconfliction software must be able to interpolate a Z value mid-segment.

<DESC>The Fleet and Industrial Supply Center (FISC) Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to contract with Outstart, Incorporated, for a four-month, interim effort to support the Navy's Learning Content Management System (LCMS).  The Outstart Evolution software application was selected in 2002 to serve as the Navy's LCMS.  The LCMS is the keystone software application enabling learning content management and content reusability within the Navy's Integrated Learning Environment (ILE).  Under the proposed four-month contract, the Navy will procure engineering, technical, and training services to support the Navy’s operation of the Outstart Evolution application and its integration into the ILE.  These services will enable tasks such as, but not limited to, integrating the Evolution LCMS with existing and planned Learning Management Systems and databases, data preparation, ingestion of objects, personnel training in operation and administration of the LCMS, troubleshooting assistance, problem resolution, and general support for the LCMS.  FISC Norfolk Detachment Philadelphia intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with Outstart, Incorporated, for this requirement under the authority of section 4202 of the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, as implemented by FAR 13.501(a), as a sole source acquisition under the authority of the test program for certain commercial items.  This firm is considered the only source capable of providing services which meet all of the Navy's requirements by the required start date of 25 Sep 04 as they are the current vendor supporting their proprietary Evolution application.  No other sources are considered capable of providing the necessary support services, which include software upgrades, as well as test and evaluation of software code.  Interested parties may identify their interest and prove their capability to respond to this requirement for Outstart Evolution support services.  This notice of intent is NOT a request for competitive proposals.  However, all information received by 20 Sep 04 will be considered by the Government.  Information received as a result of this notice of intent will be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement (including a possible longer-term effort after this four-month interim requirement).  A determination by the Government not to open the requirement to competition based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government.  The Government will not pay for information received.

<DESC>The Defense Energy Support Center (DESC), in conjunction with the United States Army, plans to offer the privatization of the natural gas systems at Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield, Savannah, Georgia.  Privatization is defined as the transfer of ownership and responsibility for the operation, maintenance, repair, future upgrades, and future utility systems replacement.  As a result of this solicitation, the firm will be selected to assume ownership of the system to meet future needs of the government.  The resulting contract, if awarded, will require the Contractor to furnish all facilities, labor, tools, materials, and equipment necessary to own, operate, and maintain the utility system.  The Contractor shall manage the maintenance, repairs, replacement, etc. of the systems to assure continuous, adequate, and dependable service for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for each Government or tenant connection within the service area.  The Contractor shall be responsible for funding all capital investments required to acquire, operate, and maintain the utility system in a safe, reliable condition and to meet the requirements listed in the contract.  Real property interests will be conveyed in the form of an Easement as an attachment to the RFP.  The utility system will be conveyed via a Bill of Sale upon award of the contract.  Past performance information from potential Offeror's shall be submitted as directed by the RFP.  The Installations and utility systems being privatized are described as follows:

FORT STEWART ARMY INSTALLATION 

Fort Stewart is a 279,568 acre Army installation on the Lower Coastal Plain of east-central Georgia.  The reservation occupies portions of Evans, Tattnall, Long, Liberty, and Bryan counties.  The cantonment and family housing areas are entirely within Liberty County.  The town of Hinesville lies at the southern boundary of Fort Stewart.  Savannah, the largest metropolitan area in the region, is 20 miles northeast of Hinesville. 

A Propane Air Plant is located at Fort Stewart, and is owned and operated by a contractor.   The Propane Air Plant is not included in this privatization contract and the contract to operate and maintain the plant will not be altered if and when a successful offeror is chosen for award of the privatization of the Fort Stewart natural gas system.  The Fort Stewart Propane Air Plant allows Fort Stewart to purchase gas under an interruptible rate schedule.  The function of the propane system is to provide gas supplies during any outages of normal gas service.  The propane contractor sends his personnel to activate the propane system, which supplies an air and propane mixture during the curtailment period to satisfy Fort Stewart's demand load.  Outages due to improper operation of the Plant (e.g. improper mixture of propane and air) will not be the responsibility of the Natural Gas privatization contractor.  When outages due to improper operation of the Plant occur, the Government and the Propane Air Plant Operator will respond to restore service and relight pilot lights (to include housing areas). 

NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
Natural gas is supplied by Atlanta Gas and Light Company and delivered to Fort Stewart at a pressure of 300 pounds per square inch (psig).  The pressure is reduced to 40 psig at pressure reducing stations near the main meters.  The 40 psig gas is then distributed throughout Fort Stewart.  The distribution system utilizes approximately 76 valves of various sizes, and approximately seven main meters to serve approximately 400 buildings.  Most of the service connections are in the housing area.  The natural gas lines are primarily coated steel pipe with a small amount of polyethylene pipe.  The system is comprised of approximately 110,920 linear feet (21 miles) of pipe ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 8 inches in diameter. The natural gas distribution system was constructed over various periods.  The initial system (and about 60% of the current system) was constructed during the 1940s.  The average life of the system is estimated to be 40 years old.  The system is currently operated and maintained on a non-dedicated basis.  Maintenance of the lines primarily involves fixing the lines when broken or when a leak is reported.


HUNTER ARMY AIRFIELD
Hunter Army Airfield is a 5,370 acre U.S. Army Installation located in Savannah Georgia.  Hunter Army Airfield is entirely within Chatham County and is bounded by Interstate Highway I-516 on the north, CSX railroad on the west, Little Ogeechee River on the south, and commercially developed land on the east and southeast.

NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
Natural gas is supplied by Atlanta Gas and Light Company and delivered to Hunter Army Airfield at a pressure of 300 pounds per square inch (psig).  The pressure is reduced to 40 psig at the pressure reducing station adjacent to the main meter at the intersection of Montgomery Street and Duncan Drive.  This 40 psig gas is then delivered throughout the Hunter Army Airfield natural gas distribution system.  The distribution system utilizes approximately 11 valves of various sizes, and one main meter to serve approximately 17 buildings.  The natural gas lines are primarily coated steel pipe with a small amount of polyethylene pipe.  The system is comprised of approximately 22,760 linear feet (4.3 miles) of pipe ranging in size from less than 2 inches to 8 inches in diameter. The natural gas distribution system was constructed over various periods.  The initial system (and about 60% of the current system) was constructed during the 1940s.  The average life of the system is estimated to be 40 years old.  The system is currently operated and maintained on a non-dedicated basis.  Currently, maintenance of the lines primarily involves fixing the lines when broken or when a leak is reported.
All responsible sources may submit an offer, which shall be considered.  Large businesses are required to submit a subcontracting plan with their offer.  Interested sources shall contact Benita Jackson at (703) 767-9407 to be added to our bidders mailing list.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement o r submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received by 28 September 2004 will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete with this proposed contract ba sed upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement.

A best value approach will be used in the source selection process.  The Government anticipates that the contract award will include an initial Cost Plus Fixed Fee effort for a System Design and Development (SDD) phase with Firm Fixed Price Options for Low  Rate Initial Production (LRIP) and Not to Exceed Fixed Priced Options for Production.

<DESC>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) N61339-01-R-0023 was publicized in the CBD on 01 March 2001 by the U.S. Army Research, Development and Engineering Command Simulation and Training Technology Center RDECOM STTC (formerly STRICOM). This notice calls for White Paper Submissions in reference to the research interest entitled, “Battlefield Simulation Research: 1-E. Rapid Construction of Urban Terrain Databases” Technical Points of Contact for this specific white paper submission: Mr. Julio de la Cruz, RDECOM STTC, (407)384-3733, julio.delacruz@us.army.mil (email contact preferred). Contractual Points of Contact: NAVAIR-Orlando-TSD, Ms. Debra Leuschel, Contract Specialist, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826 or Ms. Vanessa Dobson, Procuring Contracting Officer, 12350 Research Parkway, Orlando, FL 32826. 

OBJECTIVE: The Rapid Construction of Urban Terrain Databases for Training Program will develop an open database generation system supported by automated processes and tools that enable rapid generation of realistic geospecific representation (databases) of urban environments for tactical operations.  The database generation system shall provide three-dimensional (3D) geospatial representation of the urban battlespace by: 
 
1.	Developing viable methodologies and technologies to support the rapid construction of geospecific urban terrain databases. The open database generation system will overcome manual and manpower intensive processes by developing automated tools for construction of complex and high resolution geospecific urban digital terrain.  Urban digital terrain is described as, but not limited to, elevations, features, and attributes provided by, but not limited to, information provided in maps, geospatial systems and geospecific overhead imagery from authoritative data providers, 1:12.5K scale or better data sets.  
2.	Evolving open standards and automated tools for the generation of 3D models and artifacts.  There is high interest in developing the representations of subterranean and above ground structures and interiors but no limited to those representations. The representation can be built from the following sources, but not limited to, a photograph, video, CAD drawing, and LIDAR imagery, building floor plans and other architectural/engineering/construction (A/E/C) data formats.   The evolved open standards shall leverage the definition of common standard for data integration between constructive, virtual, and live models and simulations (M&S) for urban training requirements. 
3.	Developing methodologies and technologies to support seamless correlation between the open database generation system and disparate M&S run time systems.  Methodologies to include management techniques allowing for the automated insertion/removal of 3D models or artifacts within the geospecific digital terrain.
4.	Developing methodologies and technologies for realistic dynamic modeling of weapons effects on 3D models or artifacts in a real time dynamic environment.  Placing emphasis on interoperability between OOS models and the virtual environment visual representation. 
5.	Leveraging and integrating the open database generation system into the   Synthetic Environment (SE) CORE program. The open database generation system shall address current and future Army systems requirements for geospatial data and services across the urban operation spectrum of Army activities. 
6.	Evolving common data models and representations for geospecific urban terrain, focusing on defining and extending a shared urban terrain representation.  This serves as a basis for setting data-provision objectives for authoritative data providers, and data-sharing objectives for Army application.
7.	Developing methodologies and technologies for implementation  and capture of  realistic urban representation, and effectively using representations of interiors and structure of buildings, tunnels, sewers, and the placement and state of smaller structures such as furniture, doors, and ventilation grills.  It also includes the implementation of  requirements for non-spatial representations that capture functional characteristics of environmental objects, i.e.: that a particular power panel controls a certain area of lighting, signage or electric outlets; that a particular wall provides load-bearing support to specific overhead objects; that damage to a particular power pylon affects power distribution to specific industrial facilities; and that contamination in a certain water reservoir or water distribution facility affects specific water distribution points.  Aspects of these requirements have been captured in Environmental Data Models (EDMs) for specific systems, such as the OOS EDM for Ultra-High Resolution Buildings (UHRB), the OOS EDM for Terrain and SECORE.
8.	Developing prototype products that can be integrated into the SE Core STDGS baseline. The development of the urban database generation system (tools and processes) will be driven by increasingly realistic demonstrations.
9.	The contractors will propose specific component-level assessment metrics to be used in such component-specific experiments. The following metrics shall be accessed and met by the end of phase II:   The technology developed shall be accessed in training and simulation systems to demonstrate that a better, faster, cheaper urban terrain generation capability has been achieved to support mission rehearsal, training, planning, and course of action analysis.   The threshold for urban terrain database development time is three (3) weeks with an objective of two (2) weeks.   The resolution threshold for high fidelity (high attribution/high fidelity ground and underground structures) database development cost is $300K with a goal of $100K. The target nominal database size is a 2.5km x 2.5km urban terrain database at high fidelity derived from a DTED level 5 or data source equivalent. 




BACKGROUND: The Rapid Construction of Urban Terrain Databases for Training program focuses on the challenge of providing a database generation system supported by automated processes and toolsets that enable representations and multiple formats of three-dimensional urban terrain databases. Furthermore, there must be support to include the urban battle space representation for training, planning, and mission rehearsal by creating, modifying and sharing data and complex models via a common Modeling and Simulation infrastructure. There is an increasing demand for the generation, representations and impact of simulated urban terrain, environment for use in training, mission rehearsal, planning, analysis, development, and operational tests and evaluations. These simulated battlefield environments must exhibit realistic representations and interactions between computer generated forces and as perceived by humans, both synchronized in time and space such that war fighters, both individually and collectively, experience the complexity of dynamic force-on-force battlespace awareness. Moreover, the simulated environments must be accredited based on validated models, processes and methodologies.   In a number of recent requirements documents, US military leaders call for the development of techniques and tools to address this critical challenge. In the US Army Community, the need for a capability to provide battlespace awareness that can provide rapid production of geo-specific regions from multi-spectral/textured representations, common database, dynamic terrain features, complex models/shapes, and free moving objects to standard and open processes and tools is imminent.  Today's practices of military war fighters and decision-making do include a number of processes specifically aimed at identifying static battlefield representations.  Currently, these processes and tools are largely manual, as well as stovepiped, and do not involve any significant use of cost effective automation that is repeatable and standardized. Other flaws of the current Army geospatial data processes include: lack of accurate data, inconsistency among data providers, and incomplete tool sets for data integration and validation, lack of data standards, no central control or management.  Thus, the challenge is to evolve effective methodologies and techniques for the development of a database generation system with tools and processes to support rapid urban terrain database generation for different levels of terrain resolution and complex models shapes.  This must include correlated databases that support simulation functions such as semi-automated forces, embedded training and embedded simulation; verification and validation of correlated databases for visual, plan view displays; and paper and electronic maps for tactical training systems in support of future instantiations for the Interim and Objective Force.  Moreover, these methodologies shall facilitate the transfer and reuse of existing terrain database formats in support of disparate M&S systems. The Future Force will also use terrain data in modeling and simulation formats to conduct training prior to deploying forces to combat.


PROGRAM SCOPE
A phased approach to this effort is sought.  White Papers should address a basic award (Phase 1) and 1 priced option (Phase 2) as stated below.  The anticipated funding for this effort is approximately $2,500,000.00.

PHASE I.  The phase I effort will design and build the overall framework, interfaces, representations and formats that supports the open database generation system as outlined in  the objectives of this BAA. This phase will include two technical reviews.  For planning purposes, assume the reviews will be 6 and 11 months after contract award.  In addition, the contractors will design and perform in-house demonstrations to assess the progress made toward the program goals in development of the contractor's respective component.  Phase I will be a 12 month effort. 


PHASE II. The phase II effort will further evolve development efforts for Urban Terrain Databases by maturing the open database generation system as outlined in the objectives of this BAA into a functional system and an assessment program that provides quantitative metrics as discussed.  In addition, the contractors will design, perform and manage demonstrations, define system-and component-level metrics, liaison and integrate the Urban Terrain Database generation system with the SECORE Standard Terrain Database Generation System (STDGS) development contractor.
This phase will include two demonstrations for planning purposes, assume the demonstrations will be 18 and 23 months after contract award.  

Phase II will be a 12 month effort.  There will be at least 2 mandatory formal technical interchange meetings during phase II. Each proposal shall include a statement that the offeror agrees to: a) Government purpose rights applying to both technical data and software developed under effort. b)  The formal exchange of technical information with other SE Core Programs, subject to signed non-disclosure agreements and c) participation in the interchange meetings with SE Core STDGS development contractor.

This announcement constitutes the entire solicitation for this effort.

<DESC>THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0077.  The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for activities in the southern area of the State of Texas managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations - Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and outlying airfields, Naval Air Station Kingsville and outlying airfields, and Naval Station Ingleside.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million.  Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range.  This procurement will include potential set-asides for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include-Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation- including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, f drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8a or HUBZone contractor, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8a or HUBZONE contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone contractor with the highest rating will receive the award in Phase II.  This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders.  If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction. Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts. An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects. All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders. Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages. Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable. If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order. Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror. The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government. OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals. However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 30 January 2004.  Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil.  Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site.  The official planholders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web.

Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include-Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach.  Phase I Design-Build Factors relate to the five year IDIQ contract requirements for general building type projects-new construction and renovation-including, but not limited to administrative, aircraft support facility, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical, electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, sewage, potable water-storage, transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation and community support type facilities.  Only those proposers selected in Phase I will be allowed to proceed into Phase II.  An 8a or HUBZone contractor, only 1, that receives at least an Acceptable overall rating in Phase I will automatically receive a contract award in Phase II.  If more than one 8a or HUBZONE contractor receives at least an overall rating of Acceptable in Phase I, the 8a or HUBZone contractor with the highest rating will receive a basic contract award in Phase II.  This successful 8a or HUBZone contractor will compete on the seed projects and all future task orders. Otherwise eligible 8a and HUBZone contractors are invited to participate on an unrestricted basis as appropriate.   If the successful 8a or HUBZone contractor does not receive award of a task order over the life of the contract, a project with a value of under $3 million will be negotiated on a sole source basis with this contractor to meet the minimum guarantee portion of the contract.  In Phase II, a maximum of seven Phase I offerors will be allowed to submit technical and price proposals.  Offerors who fail to submit technical and price proposals will not be considered for an award.  The Phase II technical proposal will require preparation of a limited design solution, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, and other factors that define the quality of construction.  Price proposals may include total price or evaluation of scope-design options with the Government’s published budget for award.  The offeror with the best value proposal, for each seed project, if there is more than one, will be awarded the seed project under one of the IDIQ design-build contracts.  An offeror may be awarded more than one of the seed projects.  All contractors awarded an IDIQ contract under Phase II will compete on subsequent task orders.  Each awarded task order will indicate a specific completion date and associated liquidated damages.  Subsequent task orders may be awarded on either the best value continuum or low price, technically acceptable.  If the government decides to issue the task order as a best value, award factors may vary depending on the unique requirements for each task order.  Should one of the IDIQ contractors be unable to competitively secure a task order to meet the minimum guarantee, then the Government reserves the right to negotiate a task order with only that offeror.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award; to negotiate with any or all offerors; to award the contract to other than the offeror submitting the lowest total price; and to award to other than the offeror submitting the highest technically rated proposal; and to award to the offeror submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous BEST VALUE to the Government.  OFFERORS WILL BE ADVISED AN AWARD MAY BE MADE IN PHASE II, WITHOUT DISCUSSION OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED.  Phase II proposals will be requested initially on the most favorable price and technical terms.  Offerors should not assume that they will be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  However, the Government reserves the right to clarify certain aspects of proposals or conduct discussions providing an opportunity for the offeror to revise its proposal. Firms submitting technical and price proposals will not be compensated for specifications or documentation. The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 30 January 2004. Phase II will be issued at a later date.  The entire solicitation, including plans and specifications, will be available for viewing and downloading at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil. Prospective offerors must register themselves on the web site. The official planholders list will be maintained and can be printed from the web. Amendment will be posted on the web site for downloading. This will normally be the only method of distributing amendments; therefore, IT IS THE OFFEROR’S RESPONSIBILITY TO CHECK THE WEB SITE PERIODICALLY FOR ANY AMENDMENTS TO THIS SOLICITATION.  Offeror’s must also be registered in the Contractor’s Central Registration, CCR, in order to participate in this procurement.  The website for CCR is http://www.ccr.gov.  For inquiries about proposals due or number of amendments issued, contact Shirley Shumer at 843-820-5923.

<DESC>CORRECTION-THE PHASE I PROPOSAL DUE DATE WILL BE ON OR ABOUT 01 MARCH 2004. 
THIS PRE-SOLICITATION IS BEING ADVERTISED FOR ONE SOLICITATION RESULTING IN THE AWARD OF UP TO FOUR SEPARATE INDEFINITE DELIVERY INDEFINITE QUANTITY, IDIQ, DESIGN-BUILD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS OF WHICH ONE MAY POTENTIALLY BE AWARDED TO A SUCCESSFUL 8A OR HUBZONE CONTRACTOR AND THE OTHER THREE ARE INTENDED TO BE UNRESTRICTED.  The Solicitation Number will be referred to as N62467-04-R-0077.  The SIC Code for this Solicitation is 236220-Commercial and Institutional Building Construction.  The Size Standard is $28,500,000.  Work covers general building type projects, new construction and renovations, including but not limited to, administrative, aircraft support facilities, industrial buildings, marine construction, mechanical and electrical improvements, civil construction, grading, drainage, and sewage, potable water – storage and transmission, training, dormitory, family housing renovation, community support type facilities, and maintenance for such facilities for activities in the southern area of the State of Texas managed by Southern Division Naval Facilities Engineering Command.  The work will be at the following primary locations - Naval Air Station Corpus Christi and outlying airfields, Naval Air Station Kingsville and outlying airfields, and Naval Station Ingleside.  Proposers will be evaluated using the Two-Phase Design-Build, Request for Proposal, RFP, procedures that result in awards based on BEST VALUE to the Government, price and other factors considered.  Each contract is for one year with four option years.  The anticipated workload is $75-$100 million over the life of all contracts and the maximum combined value of all contracts will not exceed $200 million.  Projects will vary in size from around $3 million to $15 million with the average project in the $3 - $6 million range.  This procurement will include potential set-asides for one 8a eligible or one HUBZone eligible contractor.  These contractors will be required to be rated as at least Acceptable in Phase I in order to proceed to Phase II. If an 8a or HUBZone contractor is not able to meet the requirements to make them Acceptable in Phase I, the contract will be reverted to Unrestricted and awarded as such.  The successful offerors will be expected to submit technical and price proposals on all future task orders. Lack of participation may result in the Government not exercising the option for extending the contract.  Participation in Pre-Proposal Conferences or Site Visits for the initial award or any task orders is the responsibility of the offeror and is not directly reimbursable by the Government.  Task orders may require multi-disciplined design services in all aspects of general building construction for new and renovation projects including comprehensive interior design, lead and asbestos abatement.  Projects may also require incorporation of sustainable features.  Multiple design teams may be proposed to satisfy a variety of building types projected to be awarded during the term of the contract.  All professional disciplines shall be registered and/or certified in their discipline.  In those states requiring specialized knowledge of local permitting or regulatory agency requirements, the professional discipline shall be registered or certified in that state. Phase I of the procurement process is a narrowing phase up to a maximum of seven proposers, design-build teams, based on design-build factors that include-Past Performance, Small Business Subcontracting Effort, Technical Qualifications-including proposed subcontractors, and Management Approach.

<DESC>NOTE:  PROPOSAL DUE DATE HAS CHANGED FROM 15 SEPTEMBER 2004 TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2004.  THE COMPLETE ANNOUNCEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHANGED DATE, IS AS FOLLOWS:  
1. This Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement is for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2005 (CWID 2005), formally known as the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration, scheduled for 31 May through 24 June 2005. The focus for CWID 2005 is on coalition interoperability, Homeland Defense (HLD), and Homeland Security (HLS). Combatant commands, Services and Department of Defense (DOD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DOD, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and national participants outside the United States must submit interoperability trial proposals for CWID 2005 by 30 September 2004. Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DOD to submit trials. Complete details on CWID 2005, to include the format and submission instructions for trials, can be found at http://www.jwid.js.mil. 
2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event that enables the US combatant commands and international community to investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability.  US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) on behalf of the Chairman is responsible for the oversight of CWID.  The intent is to conduct trials of C4ISR capabilities during CWID which can then be moved into operational use within 6-12 month following the execution period. Trials are not limited to evaluations of hardware or software solutions. The tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with using technology are just as important as the solutions themselves and further investigations into these areas using CWID as a vehicle are encouraged. The USJFCOM J86I Joint Interoperability and Integration (JI&I) Transformation Change Proposal (TCP) process will be the primary method used to responsibly field promising technologies to fit warfighter requirements in the 6-12 month timeframe. 
3. United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) is the host combatant command for CWID 2005. Consequently, the scenario for CWID 2005 will incorporate aspects of HLD and HLS in addition to traditional coalition operations. USNORTHCOM plans to include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Coast Guard. USNORTHCOM intends to use CWID as a proving ground for emerging C4ISR technologies relevant to HLD and HLS. Coalition participation remains the cornerstone of CWID.  Anticipated international participants will include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO to include several constituent nations. In addition, all combatant commanders may invite nations, with prior JFCOM approval, from within their respective area-of-responsibility to participate as multinational task force (MTF) members. 
4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for validation of C4ISR solutions. Depending on capabilities to be demonstrated during CWID Execution each trial may receive one or more of the following assessments based on the criteria set forth in the CWID 2005 additional information document:  Warfighter/Operator, Technical/Interoperability, and/or Security Capabilities assessment.  The Systems Engineering Integration Working Group (SEIWG) with input from other working groups will report on trials not formally assessed by the Assessment Working Group (AWG).   Results from all trials will be reported on in the CWID final report. Trials with coalition partners are conducted over a worldwide secure network enabling trials classified SECRET releasable to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and NATO. Use of other information domains over other networks to support participation of additional nations and the information flow required for the HLS/HLD portion of the scenario depends on which other nations and which U.S. government agencies participate. The CWID Joint Management Office (JMO) coordinates, engineers and supervises the network backbone(s), information domains and the worldwide venue, and provides the trial assessments. 
5. To be considered for participation in CWID 2005, each proposed trial must:  
a. Address one or more of the CWID 2005 objectives listed in paragraph 6.  
b. Commit to fully resource the trial (funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, documentation, etc.) for CWID 2005 at one or more CWID site. 
c. Industry partners must submit trials in concert with a DOD sponsor or with a government sponsor from outside the DOD. Trial proposals must be provided in a specific format as detailed on the CWID web site. 
The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG), in concert with the coalition partners, will select specific trial proposals for execution by 7 November 2004 given projected availability of resources, how well the trial dovetails with the objectives, and additional considerations as specified on the CWID web site in the supplemental guidance to the FBO. USNORTHCOM will provide an initial determination on those trials related to HLD/HLS. 
6. USJFCOM, in coordination with USNORTHCOM, gathered and prioritized objectives for CWID 2005 from the Unified Commands, NATO, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. A summary of the eight specific CWID 2005objectives follows.
CWID 2005 Overarching Objectives and Explanations
Overview:  
The term coalition has changed significantly since the events of 9/11.  The traditional thought of coalitions that included national military to military, now incorporate civilian agencies.  The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) has highlighted the need for unimpeded information sharing between traditional coalition partners, and perhaps as significantly between DoD and non-DoD agencies.  The interagency requirements for information sharing are, in many cases, more complex than those of traditional military to military coalition partners because of a lack of common standards for both hardware and software.  
Coalition operations in response to international crises continue to highlight the requirement for coalitions to exchange C4ISR information seamlessly.  The acceptance and endorsement of the network centric warfare concept by the U.S. and the nations within the various coalitions participating in these operations, points to the need to resolve the technical, procedural and policy challenges that accompany this concept.  
The Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) program remains the premier event for U.S. and Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HLS/D) coalitions, and traditional international coalition participants to explore interoperability solutions.  The emphasis on technical assessments, military utility assessments, warfighter, and security evaluations of these solutions will lead to accelerated fielding by the U.S. to its warfighters and inter-agencies.  CWID also provides the proper framework to nominate technologies and trials for joint standards.  CWID 2005 offers a continuation of this successful venue to work through all aspects of the solution, focusing on network centricity, and accompanying needs to refine current procedures and policies or create new ones in support of technical advances.  
All hardware, software, or Tactics, Techniques or Procedures (TTPs) solutions to a CWID 2005 objective should support the overall network centric warfare and information centric concept.  During CWID planning and execution, trial activities may be run over, or connected to, the coalition wide area network either in support of military operations or military assistance to civil agencies.  All trials are run within the context of an overarching scenario to show how coalition warfighting and civil operations can benefit by using the technology, procedures, or policy changes, associated with the trial.
Objective 1:  
Improve command mission assurance planning and execution capabilities and procedures for Homeland Defense and Civil Support, by providing applications and innovative operational constructs (i.e., procedures, processes, concepts) that address integrated and technology-enabled planning across information assurance, continuity of operations, anti-terrorism/force protection and critical infrastructure protection.  (Mission Assurance)
Explanation:  Mission Assurance requirements are key to the success of overall Coalition, DoD, and civil authority Homeland Defense efforts.  Mission Assurance is defined to incorporate the areas of: Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP), Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), Information Assurance (IA), Responsive Effective Logistics, and Continuity of Operations (COOP).   Software & hardware tools are required for coordinated planning within and across these areas.  A critical capability for these tools includes the requirement to monitor, assess and report threats and hazards affecting critical infrastructure vulnerabilities; plan to detect, deter and mitigate threats; and defend critical infrastructure throughout the Area of Responsibility.  Solutions must address the capability to automatically access and display actionable Homeland Defense and Civil Support information from multiple organizations, including military, DoD, and non-DoD agencies.   Information must be available to the user in multiple media (e.g., Web Portal, GIS enabled thin client, etc) regardless of information domain membership and must be capable of tailoring to priority user needs.  Solutions presented should address system integration and data conversion issues.
Objective 2:  
Provide an enhanced interoperable situation awareness capability, scalable in time, scope and bandwidth within and between information domains.  Inherent in this objective is the underlying, continuing need to fuse and distribute information.  (Situational Awareness)
Explanation:  Situational awareness is more then providing a common operational picture at the strategic or major echelon level of command.  Situational awareness must be able to be scaleable in scope and bandwidth for use at the theater, tactical, and unit levels.  Inherent in this requirement is the need to fuse dissimilar information and to extract specific data sets needed at the theater, tactical, unit levels.  
Trial proposals must use existing interface standards that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data to the greatest extent possible.  Solutions must support each nation’s disclosure and release policy. Possible information to exchange would include friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, GIS map data, other intelligence information, etc.  Of particular interest to USNORTHCOM is the exchange of GIS and GCCS information with non-DOD, Federal, State and local participants via a protected network, common to all.  Information exchange should support planning and execution of operations.  At a higher level, this issue concerns effective information dissemination and knowledge management.  This includes problems of integration, translation, or conversion of data in one format to another; identification of producers and consumers of information; and how to transmit the information securely from end to end while supporting national disclosure/release policy.  A key subset to this situational awareness environment is that users must be able to securely access, extract and utilize information contained within dissimilar databases across multiple information domains, when operating with limited bandwidth. 
Objective 3:  
Provide solutions to facilitate information sharing across multiple information domains.  (Multi-Level/Multi-Domain Protection)
Explanation:  Information sharing requirements prompted by the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) are complex.  The complexity is increased by the need for civil agencies of one nation to interact with those of other nations in addition to traditional military to military coordination.  Coalitions inherently require separation of participants into various information domains.  Information domains are frequently equated to individual, separated networks or to electronically isolated enclaves (protected information exchange environments) within a given network. The information exchange between these participants must be accomplished in such a way that all participants establish a sense of trust that such sharing of information is required, will be disseminated securely, and will be only available to agreed upon and authorized participants.  Additionally, the integrity of sharing the information across networks must be preserved.  Traditional guarding technologies employed at information domain boundaries limit the advantages of network centric warfare where information dissemination is at a premium.  Potential trials need to explore web technology, improved data labeling, or enhancements to existing solutions while being realistically acceptable to security management concerns.  Where applicable data encryption must be accomplished at the lowest level.
Objective 4:  
Provide solutions and offer techniques and procedures that enable collaborative planning across a bandwidth constrained operational environment. (Collaborative Information Environment)
Explanation: Network centric warfare implies that coalition, DoD and civil authorities can harness the power of their information environment to collaboratively plan and execute operations even when bandwidth is constrained.  Collaborative planning in a bandwidth constrained environment across and within domains is an emerging issue for the warfighter particularly as software and procedure tools are now robust enough to be extended from the theater to tactical levels.  Existing tools such as Sametime and DCTS must be adapted to easily interoperate with each other.  Procedures must be established and validated by the warfighters to maximize the use of these tools.  
Objective 5:  
Provide solutions to permit enhanced sharing and dissemination of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) products within and across information domains.  (ISR Dissemination)
Explanation:  Operations require an information environment that spans multiple information domains.  These information domains may be populated and maintained by military or civil agencies or a combination of both and likely will be bandwidth constrained.  ISR products represent essential information exchange requirements (IER) between these information domains.  Solutions to achieve this movement of ISR products should consider use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.   
Objective 6:  
Provide solutions to address in-transit security of information being exchanged between fixed domains and mobile users.  (Wireless Security)
Explanation:  Within any information environment, there are users who must operate away from fixed information domains that span multiple locations.  These users and/or first responders require interoperable secure wireless approaches to receive and transmit critical voice, data, and video information to support the network centric warfare concept.  Solutions presented should be security accredited by national authorities or very close to accreditation. 
Objective 7:  
Provide improvements to language translation tools to allow grammatically correct, simultaneous multi-language translations to support verbal and textual collaboration.  (Language Translation)
Explanation:  Coalition operations may involve multiple nations and organizations that do not use a common language.  Tools to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges with planners and end-users, is a requirement of operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.  Current tools have limited vocabularies for limited languages and may not provide grammatically correct translations.  Additionally, no tool currently provides for the simultaneous translation of a single language to multiple languages.
Objective 8: 
Provide solutions for responsive effective logistics within and between multiple information domains.  (Integrated Logistics)
Explanation:  Within the information environment of a coalition operation, military and civil-agencies have requirements to provide responsive effective logistics.  Logistic data availability is contained within multiple logistic information systems maintained by the military and civilian agencies across the coalition.  Access to the data implies combining total asset visibility and information on transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information domains.  Solutions should address the locating and fusion of logistics information feeds into part of the commander’s general situation awareness.  Technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) must be explored to ensure full support of integrated logistics.  All solutions to achieve this should consider use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations or propose new approaches that are relatively mature in gaining security certification for operational use.

<DESC>DUE DATE FOR PROPOSAL SUBMISSION IS CHANGED FROM 15 SEPTEMBER 2004 TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2004.  1. This Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) announcement is for the Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration 2005 (CWID 2005), formally known as the Joint Warrior Interoperability Demonstration, scheduled for 31 May through 24 June 2005. The focus for CWID 2005 is on coalition interoperability, Homeland Defense (HLD), and Homeland Security (HLS). Combatant commands, Services and Department of Defense (DOD) Agencies (C/S/As), government agencies outside the DOD, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and national participants outside the United States must submit interoperability trial proposals for CWID 2005 by 30 SEPTEMBER 2004. Industry partners must work through a C/S/A or government agency sponsor from outside the DOD to submit trials. Complete details on CWID 2005, to include the format and submission instructions for trials, can be found at http://www.jwid.js.mil. 
2. CWID is the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's annual event that enables the US combatant commands and international community to investigate command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) solutions that focus on relevant and timely objectives for enhancing coalition interoperability.  US Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM) on behalf of the Chairman is responsible for the oversight of CWID.  The intent is to conduct trials of C4ISR capabilities during CWID which can then be moved into operational use within 6-12 month following the execution period. Trials are not limited to evaluations of hardware or software solutions. The tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with using technology are just as important as the solutions themselves and further investigations into these areas using CWID as a vehicle are encouraged. The USJFCOM J86I Joint Interoperability and Integration (JI&I) Transformation Change Proposal (TCP) process will be the primary method used to responsibly field promising technologies to fit warfighter requirements in the 6-12 month timeframe. 
3. United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) is the host combatant command for CWID 2005. Consequently, the scenario for CWID 2005 will incorporate aspects of HLD and HLS in addition to traditional coalition operations. USNORTHCOM plans to include the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Coast Guard. USNORTHCOM intends to use CWID as a proving ground for emerging C4ISR technologies relevant to HLD and HLS. Coalition participation remains the cornerstone of CWID.  Anticipated international participants will include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, and NATO to include several constituent nations. In addition, all combatant commanders may invite nations, with prior JFCOM approval, from within their respective area-of-responsibility to participate as multinational task force (MTF) members. 
4. CWID is conducted in a simulated operational environment to provide context for validation of C4ISR solutions. Depending on capabilities to be demonstrated during CWID Execution each trial may receive one or more of the following assessments based on the criteria set forth in the CWID 2005 additional information document:  Warfighter/Operator, Technical/Interoperability, and/or Security Capabilities assessment.  The Systems Engineering Integration Working Group (SEIWG) with input from other working groups will report on trials not formally assessed by the Assessment Working Group (AWG).   Results from all trials will be reported on in the CWID final report. Trials with coalition partners are conducted over a worldwide secure network enabling trials classified SECRET releasable to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom and NATO. Use of other information domains over other networks to support participation of additional nations and the information flow required for the HLS/HLD portion of the scenario depends on which other nations and which U.S. government agencies participate. The CWID Joint Management Office (JMO) coordinates, engineers and supervises the network backbone(s), information domains and the worldwide venue, and provides the trial assessments. 
5. To be considered for participation in CWID 2005, each proposed trial must:  
a. Address one or more of the CWID 2005 objectives listed in paragraph 6.  
b. Commit to fully resource the trial (funding, personnel, training, hardware, software, documentation, etc.) for CWID 2005 at one or more CWID site. 
c. Industry partners must submit trials in concert with a DOD sponsor or with a government sponsor from outside the DOD. Trial proposals must be provided in a specific format as detailed on the CWID web site. 
The CWID Senior Management Group (SMG), in concert with the coalition partners, will select specific trial proposals for execution by 7 November 2004 given projected availability of resources, how well the trial dovetails with the objectives, and additional considerations as specified on the CWID web site in the supplemental guidance to the FBO. USNORTHCOM will provide an initial determination on those trials related to HLD/HLS. 
6. USJFCOM, in coordination with USNORTHCOM, gathered and prioritized objectives for CWID 2005 from the Unified Commands, NATO, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. A summary of the eight specific CWID 2005objectives follows.
CWID 2005 Overarching Objectives and Explanations
Overview:  
The term coalition has changed significantly since the events of 9/11.  The traditional thought of coalitions that included national military to military, now incorporate civilian agencies.  The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) has highlighted the need for unimpeded information sharing between traditional coalition partners, and perhaps as significantly between DoD and non-DoD agencies.  The interagency requirements for information sharing are, in many cases, more complex than those of traditional military to military coalition partners because of a lack of common standards for both hardware and software.  
Coalition operations in response to international crises continue to highlight the requirement for coalitions to exchange C4ISR information seamlessly.  The acceptance and endorsement of the network centric warfare concept by the U.S. and the nations within the various coalitions participating in these operations, points to the need to resolve the technical, procedural and policy challenges that accompany this concept.  
The Coalition Warrior Interoperability Demonstration (CWID) program remains the premier event for U.S. and Homeland Security/Homeland Defense (HLS/D) coalitions, and traditional international coalition participants to explore interoperability solutions.  The emphasis on technical assessments, military utility assessments, warfighter, and security evaluations of these solutions will lead to accelerated fielding by the U.S. to its warfighters and inter-agencies.  CWID also provides the proper framework to nominate technologies and trials for joint standards.  CWID 2005 offers a continuation of this successful venue to work through all aspects of the solution, focusing on network centricity, and accompanying needs to refine current procedures and policies or create new ones in support of technical advances.  
All hardware, software, or Tactics, Techniques or Procedures (TTPs) solutions to a CWID 2005 objective should support the overall network centric warfare and information centric concept.  During CWID planning and execution, trial activities may be run over, or connected to, the coalition wide area network either in support of military operations or military assistance to civil agencies.  All trials are run within the context of an overarching scenario to show how coalition warfighting and civil operations can benefit by using the technology, procedures, or policy changes, associated with the trial.
Objective 1:  
Improve command mission assurance planning and execution capabilities and procedures for Homeland Defense and Civil Support, by providing applications and innovative operational constructs (i.e., procedures, processes, concepts) that address integrated and technology-enabled planning across information assurance, continuity of operations, anti-terrorism/force protection and critical infrastructure protection.  (Mission Assurance)
Explanation:  Mission Assurance requirements are key to the success of overall Coalition, DoD, and civil authority Homeland Defense efforts.  Mission Assurance is defined to incorporate the areas of: Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection (AT/FP), Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), Information Assurance (IA), Responsive Effective Logistics, and Continuity of Operations (COOP).   Software & hardware tools are required for coordinated planning within and across these areas.  A critical capability for these tools includes the requirement to monitor, assess and report threats and hazards affecting critical infrastructure vulnerabilities; plan to detect, deter and mitigate threats; and defend critical infrastructure throughout the Area of Responsibility.  Solutions must address the capability to automatically access and display actionable Homeland Defense and Civil Support information from multiple organizations, including military, DoD, and non-DoD agencies.   Information must be available to the user in multiple media (e.g., Web Portal, GIS enabled thin client, etc) regardless of information domain membership and must be capable of tailoring to priority user needs.  Solutions presented should address system integration and data conversion issues.
Objective 2:  
Provide an enhanced interoperable situation awareness capability, scalable in time, scope and bandwidth within and between information domains.  Inherent in this objective is the underlying, continuing need to fuse and distribute information.  (Situational Awareness)
Explanation:  Situational awareness is more then providing a common operational picture at the strategic or major echelon level of command.  Situational awareness must be able to be scaleable in scope and bandwidth for use at the theater, tactical, and unit levels.  Inherent in this requirement is the need to fuse dissimilar information and to extract specific data sets needed at the theater, tactical, unit levels.  
Trial proposals must use existing interface standards that define the format, content, and exchange mechanisms for shared data to the greatest extent possible.  Solutions must support each nation’s disclosure and release policy. Possible information to exchange would include friendly and hostile order of battle, targeting information, safe areas for marshalling, weather data, imagery, GIS map data, other intelligence information, etc.  Of particular interest to USNORTHCOM is the exchange of GIS and GCCS information with non-DOD, Federal, State and local participants via a protected network, common to all.  Information exchange should support planning and execution of operations.  At a higher level, this issue concerns effective information dissemination and knowledge management.  This includes problems of integration, translation, or conversion of data in one format to another; identification of producers and consumers of information; and how to transmit the information securely from end to end while supporting national disclosure/release policy.  A key subset to this situational awareness environment is that users must be able to securely access, extract and utilize information contained within dissimilar databases across multiple information domains, when operating with limited bandwidth. 
Objective 3:  
Provide solutions to facilitate information sharing across multiple information domains.  (Multi-Level/Multi-Domain Protection)
Explanation:  Information sharing requirements prompted by the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) are complex.  The complexity is increased by the need for civil agencies of one nation to interact with those of other nations in addition to traditional military to military coordination.  Coalitions inherently require separation of participants into various information domains.  Information domains are frequently equated to individual, separated networks or to electronically isolated enclaves (protected information exchange environments) within a given network. The information exchange between these participants must be accomplished in such a way that all participants establish a sense of trust that such sharing of information is required, will be disseminated securely, and will be only available to agreed upon and authorized participants.  Additionally, the integrity of sharing the information across networks must be preserved.  Traditional guarding technologies employed at information domain boundaries limit the advantages of network centric warfare where information dissemination is at a premium.  Potential trials need to explore web technology, improved data labeling, or enhancements to existing solutions while being realistically acceptable to security management concerns.  Where applicable data encryption must be accomplished at the lowest level.
Objective 4:  
Provide solutions and offer techniques and procedures that enable collaborative planning across a bandwidth constrained operational environment. (Collaborative Information Environment)
Explanation: Network centric warfare implies that coalition, DoD and civil authorities can harness the power of their information environment to collaboratively plan and execute operations even when bandwidth is constrained.  Collaborative planning in a bandwidth constrained environment across and within domains is an emerging issue for the warfighter particularly as software and procedure tools are now robust enough to be extended from the theater to tactical levels.  Existing tools such as Sametime and DCTS must be adapted to easily interoperate with each other.  Procedures must be established and validated by the warfighters to maximize the use of these tools.  
Objective 5:  
Provide solutions to permit enhanced sharing and dissemination of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) products within and across information domains.  (ISR Dissemination)
Explanation:  Operations require an information environment that spans multiple information domains.  These information domains may be populated and maintained by military or civil agencies or a combination of both and likely will be bandwidth constrained.  ISR products represent essential information exchange requirements (IER) between these information domains.  Solutions to achieve this movement of ISR products should consider use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations, or propose new approaches that are well on their way to gaining security certification for operational use.   
Objective 6:  
Provide solutions to address in-transit security of information being exchanged between fixed domains and mobile users.  (Wireless Security)
Explanation:  Within any information environment, there are users who must operate away from fixed information domains that span multiple locations.  These users and/or first responders require interoperable secure wireless approaches to receive and transmit critical voice, data, and video information to support the network centric warfare concept.  Solutions presented should be security accredited by national authorities or very close to accreditation. 
Objective 7:  
Provide improvements to language translation tools to allow grammatically correct, simultaneous multi-language translations to support verbal and textual collaboration.  (Language Translation)
Explanation:  Coalition operations may involve multiple nations and organizations that do not use a common language.  Tools to translate documents, displays, and written/audio-exchanges with planners and end-users, is a requirement of operations at the military, agency, and other government organization levels.  Current tools have limited vocabularies for limited languages and may not provide grammatically correct translations.  Additionally, no tool currently provides for the simultaneous translation of a single language to multiple languages.
Objective 8: 
Provide solutions for responsive effective logistics within and between multiple information domains.  (Integrated Logistics)
Explanation:  Within the information environment of a coalition operation, military and civil-agencies have requirements to provide responsive effective logistics.  Logistic data availability is contained within multiple logistic information systems maintained by the military and civilian agencies across the coalition.  Access to the data implies combining total asset visibility and information on transit of friendly forces into a single information presentation available across multiple information domains.  Solutions should address the locating and fusion of logistics information feeds into part of the commander’s general situation awareness.  Technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) must be explored to ensure full support of integrated logistics.  All solutions to achieve this should consider use of existing approved multi-level security implementations, innovative adaptations of these implementations or propose new approaches that are relatively mature in gaining security certification for operational use.

<DESC>The GPS Joint Program Office Space Missile Center (SMC/GP) intends to advance clock technology to support the development of military satellites. The objective is twofold:  to both provide an initial industrial base to support further development and procurement, and to develop space-qualified Advanced Technology Atomic Frequency Standards (ATAFS) suitable for use on future military satellites.  Funding of multiple contractors is anticipated, depending on the merits of the contractor proposals and the availability of funding. The scope of the development is to design and validate a proof-of-technology that will satisfy all of the requirements of the GPS JPO/SMC ATAFS Critical Requirements Document (CRD).  The development program consists of activities required to design, build, and test Engineering Development Models (EDM) for space application (including ruggedness against the vibration environment and thermal behavior in a vacuum).  The EDM shall be designed for radiation hardness, but does not need to include flight parts.  The development program does NOT include the redesign required to customize the ATAFS to the final Space Vehicle (SV) requirements, the build of Flight Development Models (FDM), the qualification tests of the FDM's, the final integration of the ATAFS into the SV, or the purchase of the production flight ATAFS. SYSTEM OVERVIEW: The ATAFS provides a precise and stable sinusoidal frequency in a vacuum for the SV.  The frequency stability and other performance are expected to be superior to that seen in the GPS Block IIF Atomic Frequency Standards(AFS).  Advances are expected in integrity of the output signal compared to the previously existing space clocks. CONTRACT OBJECTIVES:  To assist respondents in understanding the potential scope of this effort the following tentative contract objectives are provided as reference: (a) Develop and deliver ATAFS EDM's in accordance with the performance and design/program specifications as defined in the "GPS JPO/SMC ATAFS Critical Requirements Document (CRD)" and the "ATAFS, Statement of Objectives". Completion within 36 months after award of contract for two verified EDM's to be used for life testing and one tested validation unit (with a validation test report). The anticipated period of performance is April 2005–March 2008. (b)	Recommend modifications to the CRD. (c)	Support the generation or update of ATAFS and related documents as directed. (d) Establish a strong, near real-time dialog and feedback structure with SMC/GPE to provide government insight, achieve quick issue resolution, and respond to government direction. Prospective contractors should submit a statement of capabilities in writing no later than 05 October 2004 with documented evidence of their capability to meet all technical contractual requirements. The purpose of this announcement is to help the government identify interested potential offerors, or teams, capable of achieving the program objectives within acceptable risks and costs.  Respondents are required to submit a current statement of capability.  The capability package should provide a synopsis of relevant capabilities and past experience with the following information:  1) Company name, mailing address, points of contact, job titles, telephone numbers and email addresses, 2) Business size classification, Large, Small, or Other, 3) Experience in space AFS technologies (including prior successes in achieving development and production of space qualified AFS's; the response must emphasize the proven ability to meet the above scope and schedule), and 4) The facilities to work at the appropriate security level.  Interested offerors must submit Statements of Capabilities (SOC) that clearly show that they are qualified to perform this effort.  Responses should also indicate the source's intent to be either a prime contractor, subcontractor, or interest in using license to become a developer and supplier.  All responses are to be unclassified and should not exceed five (5) one sided pages. Respondents interested in being a subcontractor should not exceed two (2) one sided pages and should briefly identify relevant experience and expertise. Respondents interested in using data rights or licensing agreements should not exceed two (2) one sided pages and should identify their capability to use the license to become a developer and any major questions or issues regarding licensing they may have. Responses must be submitted by email in electronic form in MS Word 98 or higher format or PDF format to victor.deal@losangeles.af.mil with a follow-up signature hard copy of the submission to SMC/GPK, Attn: Carol Laechelt, 2420 Vela Way, Suite 1866, El Segundo, CA 90245-4659. All responses must conform to 8.5 x 11 inch pages, with font no smaller than 12 point.  If respondents wish to include proprietary data, they must adhere to DFAR 227.7103-10 Contractor Identification and Marking of Technical Data to be Furnished with Restrictive Markings.

<DESC>This is a Request For Information (RFI) only as defined in FAR 15.201 (e).  Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract.  Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals.  The Air Force Research Laboratory, (AFRL), and DARPA/MTO do not presently intend to award a contract, but are in need of information on potential sources in the area of Adaptive Photonic Phase-Locked Elements.   The technical areas of interest are all technologies required to build an array of sub-apertures capable of transmitting, receiving, and rapidly steering spatially phased optical energy and images in which each sub-aperture should be transmissive.    AFRL and DARPA are potentially interested in demonstrating a modular, scaleable architecture capable of scaling to large apertures and high powers. A potential objective at program’s end would be for the components, as well as the entire system, to be available commercially.  We are interested in company capabilities to manufacture and commercialize required components.  Applications of interest include: laser weapons, laser targeting/sensing, laser communication, and laser countermeasure.  Compensating for atmospheric effects is required as part of any technical approach.  Primary wavelengths of interest are approximately 1.5 mm and 1 mm.  The Government contemplates a program which would consist of 2 or 3 phases.  The first phase is expected to be 12 months, with total program length expected to be up to 5 years. 

Potential goals for the first phase include: transmissive optical phased array sub-aperture elements of 2 cm diameter or more.  Actual shape of the sub-aperture elements is a trade space item. Less than 2 msec beam switching time, >50 % fill array factor, and, an array strell ratio of at least 60 %, and imaging on receive with resolution at least a factor of two beyond the diffraction limited resolution of a single sub-aperture.   The array of sub-apertures should include at least one sub-aperture surrounded on all sides by other sub-apertures.  Nonmechanical beam steering should be continuous to at least 20 degrees in any direction, covering a field of regard of at least 40 degrees.  Algorithms should be demonstrated to allow for necessary atmospheric compensation to meet final program goals.  Over-all transmission efficiency from electrical power to far field energy steered to 20 degrees in any direction should exceed 1 %, and be higher for smaller angle beam steering. 

Goals for the final phase(s) would be as follows:
Demonstration of a half meter array of sub-apertures using 100 or fewer sub-apertures, including the ability to compensate for any atmospheric effects in real time.  The demonstrated technology should be scaleable to powers of at least 100 kW for the weapon application and one or more kilowatts for the sensing application.   A significant fraction of those power levels should be demonstrated in this program.  An array fill factor of greater then 90 % is desired and a strell ratio >90 %.  Efficiency from electrical power to a far field transmitted beam steered to a 45 degree angle in any direction should exceed 7%.   Total efficiency at smaller steering angles should be higher.  Imaging resolution through moderate turbulence should be within a factor of 1.5 of a monolithic unsteered beam emitted from a half meter aperture through clear air or vacuum.  Steering time should be under 1 millisecond from any location in the field of regard to any other location.  As a goal any sub-aperture, or any combinations of sub-apertures, should be capable of being used independently for all functions. 

Interested parties should have documented expertise and existing capability in the design, development, and production of optical phased array beam steering, phased lasers, sub-aperture receive technologies, atmospheric compensation techniques, and/or the integrations of these technologies and should identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement including their capability to manufacture and commercialize the end-product.  Comments on the above objectives are also welcome. Corporate capabilities are of strong interest, preferably with a discussion of technologies actually demonstrated, and of laboratory/manufacturing facilities already in place.  

Respondents should indicate which portions of their response are proprietary and should mark them accordingly.  Formal responses should be e-mailed (preferred), faxed or mailed to:

Under Titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act (42 USC 402 and 416), SSA mandates the State Disability Determination Services (DDS) in each state to perform determinations of disability for the residents of that state who file for Social Security disability benefits. In addition to each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the territorial governments of Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands have established DDS entities. SSA has also established a Federal DDS, which, among other functions, serves as a test-bed of policy and procedure for the disability program. Virtually every DDS currently uses, or is migrating toward the use of an IBM AS/400 (now known as IBM iSeries) mid-range processor for case processing.  Many of the state DDS’s use licensed proprietary software developed by Versa Management Systems Inc (Versa). Over the last few years, SSA and the DDS’s have been engaged in major initiatives to improve and safeguard the administration of the disability programs. One such initiative is the development of comprehensive disaster recovery for DDS operations.

This sole source acquisition will be for services related to the development of a disaster recovery infrastructure for the Federal and State Disability Determination Services (DDS) that utilize IBM AS/400 (now known as IBM iSeries) mid-range processors and Versa licensed proprietary software. Specific services to be procured from Versa include: 1) assistance in conducting exercises with the State DDS’s and SSA to simulate disaster and implementation of disaster recovery plans, 2) expert technical troubleshooting support to the State DDS’s and SSA during disaster recovery, 3) assistance in the restoration of the affected DDS’s production environment, and, 4) assistance in ensuring that DDS production data is not corrupted during simulation exercises.

At this time the Government believes Versa Management Systems to be the only source capable of providing the required services, as Versa is the only known source that can provide, modify and maintain its own software and source code. SSA will not provide the Versa proprietary source code to any third-party, nor will SSA assist any third-party in obtaining access to Versa’s proprietary source code. 

Vendors having the capability and experience to provide such services are invited to submit complete details regarding their technical capabilities and expertise. Vendor capability statements MUST include the following: 1) demonstrated success in supporting the IBM AS/400 platform, and, 2) a detailed explanation of the strategy that will be used in dealing with the Versa proprietary source code and data structures. 

The Government will consider all responses to this notice, but a determination by the Government to conduct a sole source acquisition remains at the discretion of the Government. Information submitted in response to this notice will be considered solely for the purpose of determining the feasibility of conducting a competitive procurement, and the Government will not pay for any information submitted. Interested sources that believe they have the ability to perform the services required should submit a detailed statement of their capabilities in writing to Leslie Hyman, Contract Specialist, via email at Leslie.Hyman@ssa.gov. Responses must be received by 3:00 p.m. EST on January 14, 2004. If no viable responses are received by January 14, 2004, the Government will issue a Purchase Order to Versa Management Systems, Inc.

<SUBJECT>A--COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES IN SUPPORT OT THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION
<DESC>THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION. IT IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. Commercial Space Transportation Services  in support of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  Background and Purpose:  The President has defined a Vision for Space Exploration for the nation and has charged the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to lead a sustained and affordable human and robotic program to explore the solar system and beyond. The President’s Commission on Implementation of U.S. Space Exploration Policy forwarded its report “A Journey to Inspire, Innovate, and Discover” to the President on June 4, 2004. In that report, the Commission made a number of recommendations concerning the future missions and structure of NASA. The report can be viewed electronically at http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/60736main_M2M_report_small.pdf . Recommendation 3-1 states, “The Commission recommends NASA recognize and implement a far larger presence of private industry in space operations with the specific goal of allowing private industry to assume the primary role of providing services to NASA, and most immediately in accessing low-Earth orbit.”  Since 1988, NASA has relied on acquisition of commercial launch services to meet civil science, weather observing, planetary and communications space launch requirements. This Request for Information (RFI) seeks any and all ideas for possible ways of implementing the Commission’s recommendation  as it relates to  NASA space  transportation requirements.  A separate RFI has been	issued to address commercial services other than space transportation. This RFI, issued by NASA’s Office of Space Operations, is to obtain information regarding capabilities and market interest from existing and emerging domestic commercial space transportation providers. NASA will use this information to shape agency acquisition strategy for space transportation services.    To better understand the full range of commercial participants interested in meeting  all or a subset of	NASA’s emerging space transportation requirements, please provide the following information: 1.Space Transportation Capability  a. Description of capability  b. Planned launch site/infrastructure  c. Current/planned production/annual launch capability  d. Technology maturity level, for new developments  e. Order-of-magnitude estimate of recurring service price (identify key assumptions, e.g., flight rate)  f. Order-of-magnitude estimate of non-recurring price (identify key assumptions, e.g., government/industry cost sharing, if any)  g. Estimated schedule from a service contract award to Initial Operational Capability (IOC) 2. General Information  a. Company Name, indicate if a small business  b. Products and/or service lines   c. Privately or Commercially traded  d.  Major development activities underway  e.  Subcontractors/teaming partners envisioned (indicate level of non-domestic participation)  f.  Point of contact name, phone number, email address  3. Contracting Information  a. Does your company contemplate competing for NASA or commercial space transportation services in the foreseeable future?  b. Does your company currently hold Government contracts? If so, for what products and services?  c. What type of contracting mechanism (e.g., fixed price, cost plus, etc.) is desirable and why?  Candidate NASA Requirements  Responders are invited to provide information regarding space transportation capability for any of the categories of NASA candidate mission requirements noted below:  1. Ground to Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) deploy: Missions orbital requirements range from 28.5 deg, to equatorial, to sun-synchronous, to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO)/Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) deploy. Altitude ranges from optimum direct inject transfer orbit to 407 km circular for possible assembly missions. Typical missions include weather, science, and communication satellite requirements. Provide information on your current payload capability (mass and volume) and any future proposed growth.  2. Ground to interplanetary trajectory insertion (C3&gt;0): Interplanetary missions may include nuclear propulsion or large-scale cryogenic propulsion. Provide information on your current payload capability at varying C3’s (mass and volume) and any future proposed growth.  3. Ground to LEO rendezvous: Missions could include cargo delivery to ISS, disposal of cargo and/or safe return to Earth, or ground-up rendezvous to a fuel depot (28.5 deg inclination, 407 km) and subsequent mating/docking. Transportation could include autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&D), automated rendezvous and proximity operations (ARPO) for grapple, either manual or telemetry-operations capability. Systems may also include space-based transportation for retrieving LEO cargo. Cargo will be pressurized and/or unpressurized and could include propellant, consumables, biological specimens, system hardware and scientific instruments. Return cargo could include biological specimens, system hardware, and scientific instruments. Provide information on your current payload capability (mass and volume) and any future proposed growth. Provide information on whether your capability would support any en-route services such as power, ability to handle live specimens, low or high-rate telemetry, command through-put, loads attenuation for Shuttle-built payloads, ground processing capability for payloads, etc. Reference SSP 50235 for ISS Visiting Vehicle interface definition at http://spacecraft.ssl.umd.edu/old_site/design_lib/SSP50235.ISSvehicleIDD.pdf . 4. Ground to staging location: Staging mission locations may include near-Earth locations, libration point, e.g., L1, Lunar orbit or surface. Cargo could include spacecraft/propulsion assembly elements, lunar surface elements, and lunar supplies and logistics. Transportation could include autonomous rendezvous and docking (AR&D). Provide information on your current payload capability (mass and volume) and any future proposed growth.  5. Human transport and return: Missions could include ground-up rendezvous to ISS and LEO staging locations and return. Provide information on your current payload capability (mass and volume) and any future proposed growth. Reference NPG 8705.2 for Human-Rating Requirements and Guidelines for Space Flight Systems at http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_8705_0002_&page_name=main .  6. In-Space Operations (Transportation Service Node): Operations could include long term storable cryogenic facility and other spacecraft propellants, spacecraft commercial on-orbit assembly services, either telemetry-robotic or manual, on-orbit services for spacecraft, such as, power, communication, and thermal. Systems may also include space-based transportation for retrieving LEO and ISS cargo. Provide information on your current payload capability (mass and volume) and any future proposed growth.  Safety, Programmatic, and Technical Risk  Please describe, in as much detail as possible the safety, programmatic, and technical risks you consider to be the drivers from a program execution perspective and any mitigating actions that may be appropriate for the Government to consider in its planning. Also identify planned/proposed flight demonstrations recommended as risk mitigations for new developments. Acquisition Terms and Conditions  In addition, responders are invited to provide suggestions on what conditions best enable industry to make a business case for the market segment(s) for which you are interested. The following topics are suggestions:  · Government and commercial teaming arrangements  · Innovative contractual arrangements, cost sharing, service packaging, assured flight rate commitment  · Changes in governmental regulations (i.e. access to space, protection of intellectual property, domestic and international collaboration, etc…)  · Other candidate commercial enabling conditions for NASA to consider  Response Preparation and Transmittal:  Responses should identify candidate requirement areas that are of most interest to your company and provide NASA general understanding of your proposed approach to meeting them. Questions concerning this RFI may be submitted via email no later than September 29, 2004, 5:00 PM EDT to Karen Poniatowski at karen.s.poniatowski@nasa.gov.

<SUBJECT>--US ARMY CHEMICAL MATERIALS AGENCY SEEKING DIALOGUE WITH INDUSTRY TO DISCUSS METHODS OF TRANSFERRING A MAJOR SOURCE OF DIETHYLENETRIAMINE (DETA) TO INDUSTRY
<DESC>The U.S. Army Chemical Materials Agency is seeking a dialogue with industry to discuss innovative and environmentally sound methods of transferring a major source of DETA (Diethylenetriamine) to industry.  The chemical is contained within a stockpile  of Decontamination Solution Number 2 (DS2).  The DS2 is composed of mixture of 70% Diethylenetriamine, 28% Ethylene Glycol Monomethyl Ether, and 2% NaOH.  The Army would like to discuss transfer of the ownership of some/all of the stockpile to industry fo r reuse/reprocessing.  The DS2 stockpile is stored at a Hazardous Material Enclave located at the former Seneca Army Depot in Romulus, New York.  Approximately 1.7 million gallons of DS2 are in storage and are contained in 4 DOT shippable configurations (t otal packaged gross weight of approximately 22 million pounds).  The material is approximately 16 years old and is being offered to industry because the Army is now employing alternate decontaminating solutions.  The Government would like to transfer the D S2 to industry as quickly as possible.  The actual amount to be transferred and its schedule for removal from the Enclave site could be negotiable.  This is a market survey and not a contracting action.  Interested parties should contact Charles A. Comaty,  410-436-3750, e-mail: charles.comaty@apg.army.mil

<DESC>This is a Notice of Contract Action. The Air Force Flight Test Center, Edwards AFB CA. (AFFTC) intends to modify an existing contract for telemetry support packages.  The modification would result in an additional CLIN for the purchase of KGR-68b Decryption Units.  The award will result in a modification to a sole-source, 5-year, Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity contract to L-3 Communications, Telemetry East Division, 1515 Grundy’s Lane, Bristol PA. 19007, for the following: 110 (estimated) KGR-68b units. The modification will also allow for  Upgrade/Enhancements and Maintenance/Repair to the decryption devices. The model KGR68b is a complete Telemetry Data Decryption unit designed primarily for aircraft flight test use.  This decryption device works in connection with the SP10-68 telemetry data encryption device. This unit decrypts TM signals transmitted from the aircraft to ground stations in order to reconstruct the original TM and/or 1553 signals from test aircraft.  This unit supports bit rates of 10K-Bits/Sec to 50 Mega-Bit/Sec.  It is cryptographically compatible with the KGV-68 based systems. It is compatible with existing KUTA or THORNTON class equipment and will accept the Crypto Key Fill from COMSEC fill devices such as the KOI-18 and KYK-13. The unit operates across the Plain Text domains and is characterized for TEMPEST requirements. It provides the necessary support power for the PCM Encoder Data Source, as well as the associated Telemetry Transmitter. The KGR-68b contains an encryptor plug-in module that allows for removal and/or replacement of the encryptor assembly. Other functions include provisions for erasing the Crypto Key, automatic disabling of the Telemetry Transmitter Power during the Crypto Key fill operation, and filtering of the encrypted output signal suitable for transmission. 
The NAICs code is 334220 and the size is 750 employees. Contractors must be certified by the National Security Agency. Qualified contractors must submit clear and convincing documentation that fully defines their capability to meet the requirement. Documentation that fails to provide the required capability documentation will not be acknowledged. Telephone requests to be placed on the mailing list will not be honored. This synopsis is for notification purposes only and does not constitute a solicitation for bids or proposals period. The government does not intend to pay for any information provided under this synopsis.

The Contractor shall designate this individual, in  writing, to the Contracting Officer (CO) before the contract start date.  An  alternate, or alternates, may be designated, but the Contractor shall identify  those times when the alternate shall be the primary POC.  The Contractor shall  notify the government prior to any change in management.     1.2.2.  AVAILABILITY.  The Contractor shall be available for normal service  and to provide technical advice pertaining to water sampling and analysis  Monday through Friday, 7:30 A.M. until 4:30 P.M.  The contractor shall provide  a mechanism to be contacted on an unscheduled or emergency basis after 4:30  P.M. weekdays and on weekends and holidays.  In addition to Good Friday, the  following are observed federal holidays: New Year’s Day, Martin Luther King  Jr.’s Birthday, Presidents’ Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day,  Columbus Day, Veterans’ Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day.   1.3.	SAMPLING REQUIREMENTS.     1.3.1.  SUPPLIES.       1.3.1.1.	ADMINISTRATIVE.  The Contractor shall supply all business forms  and labels necessary for sample collection and analysis.       1.3.1.2.

In addition, quarterly and annual special sampling requires  approximately 50-150 samples for total coliform analysis and approximately 30- 50 samples for HCP analysis.       1.3.2.2.	NON-ROUTINE AND NON-SCHEDULED SAMPLING.  Approximately 50-100  additional unscheduled and repeat samples may be submitted annually for total  coliform analysis to ensure constant potability of the base water system.   These samples intermittently, and with little or no notice, may be required to  be analyzed after normal business hours (after 4:30 PM) and on weekends and  holidays.  Since the timing and frequency of this sampling cannot be projected,  the Contractor shall have a mechanism in place to support this requirement as  necessary.        1.3.2.3.	EMERGENCY AND QUALITY ASSURANCE/QUALITY CONTROL (QA/QC)  SAMPLING.  Samples considered “emergency” or “QA/QC” pose possible acute health  risk to base personnel or critical Air Force mission needs.  The BEF Drinking  Water Program Manager, or alternate, will determine what type of emergency or  QA/QC sampling is required: legionella, microbial speciation, or organic or  inorganic chemical analysis.  The Contractor is required to consider samples  submitted for emergency or QA/QC analysis as their first priority and all  emergency or QA/QC samples as “same day” or “ weekend analysis required”  samples.  The Contractor shall analyze Emergency or QA/QC samples using OEPA  approved techniques as soon as possible and as fast as the approved analytical  method allows.  The Contractor shall provide a current commercial price list to  the BEF and the CO.  This listing shall include the most likely emergency  analysis for drinking water, for example legionella, microbial speciation, and  organic or inorganic chemical analysis.  The Contractor shall inform the BEF  and the CO when any price changes are made.  If an emergency sample is  identified that is not covered on the price listing or will be subcontracted,  the Contractor shall provide the government a price prior to submitting the  sample.  This price shall include any applicable subcontractor prices (i.e.  rush charges, shipping, discounts).     1.3.3.  REPORTING.       1.3.3.1.

The Contractor shall leave a  description of the problem, sample number, location of the positive result, and  a contact phone number with the ER or Base Command Post dispatcher.  The  dispatcher will pass the information to the “on-call” BEF personnel.  The  contractor shall not leave a voicemail message, fax, or electronic mail  notification for these results.  The contractor shall continue to call until  either ER or Base Command Post dispatcher is contacted.       1.3.3.2.	NEGATIVE RESULTS.  Within 24 hours the contractor shall report  negative routine, quarterly, and annual results for total coliform and HPC to  the BEF POC by phone.  The contractor shall not leave a voicemail message, fax,  or electronic mail notification for these results.  The BEF will provide a list  for the POC and alternates.  Updates will be delivered to contractor as  needed.  The contractor shall also provide a written analysis report for each  sample and deliver reports to the BEF during the proceeding scheduled pick up  of routine water samples.     1.3.4.  TRANSPORTATION OF WATER SAMPLES.       1.3.4.1.	ROUTINE SAMPLES.  The Contractor shall pick-up and transport  all routine water samples to the contract laboratory.

Prohibitions. Section 835 of Public Law 107-296, prohibits the Department of Homeland
Security from entering into any contract with a foreign incorporated entity after November 25, 2002, which is treated as an inverted domestic corporation as defined in this clause. The Secretary shall waive the prohibition with respect to any specific contract if the Secretary determines that the waiver is required in the interest of homeland security, or to prevent the loss of any jobs in the United States or prevent the Government from incurring any additional costs that otherwise would not occur. (b) Definitions. As used in this clause: Expanded Affiliated Group means an affiliated group as defined in section 1504(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (without regard to section 1504(b) of such Code), except that section 1504 of such Code shall be applied by substituting ?more than 50 percent? for ?at least 80 percent? each place it appears. Foreign Incorporated Entity means any entity which is, or but for subsection (b) of section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296, would be, treated as a foreign corporation for purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Inverted Domestic Corporation. A foreign incorporated entity shall be treated as an inverted domestic corporation if, pursuant to a plan (or a series of related transactions)- (1)     The entity completes after November 25, 2002, the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties held directly or indirectly by a domestic corporation or substantially all of the properties constituting a trade or business of a domestic partnership; (2) After the acquisition at least 80 percent of the stock (by vote or value) of the entity is held (i) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic corporation, by former shareholders of the domestic corporation by reason of holding stock in the domestic corporation; or (ii) In the case of an acquisition with respect to a domestic partnership, by former partners of the domestic partnership by reason of holding a capital or profits interest in the domestic partnership; and (3) The expanded affiliated group which after the acquisition includes the entity does not have substantial business activities in the foreign country in which or under the law of which the entity is created or organized when compared to the total business activities of such expanded affiliated group. Person, domestic, and foreign have the meanings given such terms by paragraphs (1), (4), and (5) of section 7701(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, respectively. (c) Special rules. The following definitions and special rules shall apply when determining whether a foreign incorporated entity should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation. (1) Certain stock disregarded. For the purpose of treating a foreign incorporated entity as an inverted domestic corporation these shall not be taken into account in determining ownership: (i) stock held by members of the expanded affiliated group which includes the foreign incorporated entity; or (ii) stock of such entity which is sold in a public offering related to the acquisition described in subsection (b)(1) of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296. (2) Plan deemed in certain cases. If a foreign incorporated entity acquires directly or indirectly substantially all of the properties of a domestic corporation or partnership during the 4-year period beginning on the date which is after the date of enactment of this Act and which is 2 years before the ownership requirements of subsection (b)(2) are met, such actions shall be treated as pursuant to a plan. (3) Certain transfers disregarded. The transfer of properties or liabilities (including by contribution or distribution) shall be disregarded if such transfers are part of a plan a principal purpose of which is to avoid the purpose of this section. (d) Special rule for related partnerships.     For purposes of applying section 835(b) of Public Law 107-296 to the acquisition of a domestic partnership, except as provided in regulations, all domestic partnerships which are under common control (within the meaning of section 482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) shall be treated as a partnership. (e) Treatment of Certain Rights. (1) Certain rights shall be treated as stocks to the extent necessary to reflect the present value of all equitable interests incident to the transaction, as follows: (i) Warrants; (ii) Options; (iii) Contracts to acquire stock; (iv) Convertible debt instruments; (v) Others similar interests. (2) Rights labeled as stocks shall not be treated as stocks whenever it is deemed appropriate to do so to reflect the present value of the transaction or to disregard transactions whose recognition would defeat the purpose of section 835. (f) Disclosure. By signing and submitting its offer, an offeror under this solicitation represents that it not a foreign incorporated entity that should be treated as an inverted domestic corporation pursuant to the criteria of Section 835 of the Homeland Security Act, Public Law 107-296 of November 25, 2002.

Trawls are deployed using 2 heavy cables that run from vessel winches, through blocks, and to the large trawl doors.  The net is attached to these trawl doors.  Many trawl vessels also deploy a small cable (Athird wire@) from the vessel to the trawl sonar net monitoring device.  
Observer coverage occurs on vessels 60 feet length-over-all and greater.  In this fleet the incidental take of seabirds have been documented during groundfish observer species composition sampling of the catch.  These birds are recovered from within the net.  Seabird mortality resulting from interactions with the trawl cables and the third wire has also been documented, but is not directly monitored by groundfish observers.  Therefore, the temporal and spatial distribution of seabird mortalities from these interactions is unknown.  This issue is pertinent because the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA Fisheries) Alaska Region completed an Endangered Species Act Section 7 consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that resulted in a Biological Opinion with specific requirements of NOAA Fisheries. It is important to note that no incidental takes of short-tailed albatross have so far been recorded for trawl gear although sightings around trawl fishing vessels have been reported, and a likely to adversely affect determination was made.
One requirement of the Biological Opinion is to characterize the nature of short-tailed albatross interactions with trawl gear.  The Biological Opinion also has discretionary conservation measures.  These include characterizing seabird interactions with trawl vessels and developing mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate seabird mortalities.  NOAA Fisheries is currently exploring means to achieve these requirements and conservation measures.  An observer project is underway to develop improved methods of estimating total seabird mortality for various trawl industry sectors.  Unfortunately, the observer’s ability to monitor total seabird mortalities is compromised by other critical sampling needs.  Development and implementation of mitigation measures may be a better solution, which is the basis for this procurement.
Problem Resolution
Ultimately, the resolution to seabird interactions with trawl cables, third wires, and the trawl net is to develop effective mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate seabird interactions and mortalities.  NOAA Fisheries is currently engaged in efforts to characterize the nature of seabird interactions with trawl gear, and to develop estimates of seabird mortality by species.  Parallel to this effort, NOAA Fisheries wishes to support industry efforts to develop and test measures that would mitigate seabird interactions with this gear.  Funds are provided through this procurement action to support research and development into possible seabird/trawl mitigation measures.  
STATEMENT OF WORK
The Government will award one bid in this procurement action.  Award will be made to one of the two trawl fishery components that conduct at-sea processing of catch.  The development of mitigation measures is being targeted for at-sea catcher/processor facilities due to the sometimes large numbers of birds that attend these vessels.  The two groups for which bids will be entertained are:
Group 1.  Pollock Catcher/processors deploying pelagic trawl gear, vessels larger than 125 feet.  These vessels currently all deploy third wires as well.
Group 2.  Groundfish catcher/processors deploying non-pelagic gear, vessels larger than 125 feet.  These vessels may or may not use third wires, depending on the fishery they are engaged in.
We are focusing this procurement on these two components due to best available information on where the interactions rates may be highest.  NOAA Fisheries is working to improve its ability to monitor all sources of seabird mortality in Alaska groundfish trawl fisheries.  Future procurement actions such as this one may address means of adapting measures developed here for other vessel classes where appropriate.  
Funds available through this procurement are to assist with the research, development, and pilot testing of seabird mitigation devises which would reduce interactions with trawl cables and third wires.  The funds should be used to design several measures, complete fabrication where appropriate, and assess the use of the measures under typical commercial fishing activities. Assessment should address the use of the measures, including ensuring crew safety, ease of deployment, dependability, and durability.  Assessment should also provide preliminary information on how effectively the measures reduce seabird interactions with trawl gear.  This would best be achieved through direct monitoring of seabird interactions under an array of field conditions such as weather, sea state, and juxtaposition to the offal field.  Of particular importance is to note effectiveness during the set, normal towing procedure, vessels turns, gear issues such as short-wiring the trawl net, and haulback.
Seabird mortalities are also caused when birds interact with the trawl net.  This procurement action will focus on development of mitigation measures for trawl cables and the third wire.  However, procedures ultimately need to be developed for the net as well.  It may be possible to develop measures that address all these sources of mortality at the same time.  Inclusion of a possible mitigation measure that does so will be considered advantageous.
Objectives
1.  Conduct appropriate research, development, and assessment to provide advice to the industry and government on which seabird/trawl mitigation measures are likely to be the most effective in reducing seabird interactions with trawl cables and third wires. 
2.  Measures should address trawl cables and third wires, or just trawl cables, depending on the fishery component. 
3.  Explore several different measures in order to make a reliable assessment.
4.  Ensure that the recommendations for measures based on field assessment are representative of the class of vessels and has support from other vessel operators.
Project Description
The project includes a start up phase where a variety of ideas are discussed and several of those ideas are chosen for development and testing at sea.  Vessels would then need to be fitted out with appropriate gear and a protocol established for assessments which would meet the requirements noted above.  Field testing should be completed within several months of award, followed by report writing.  The primary final product of this project is to make recommendations on which seabird mitigation devices should be tested under a rigorous experimental design to be implemented at a later date.   
As a priority, funding will be supplied to entities that can engage several different vessels to complete field testing of a variety of mitigation measures.  Funds support the development of measures, field deployment, assessment, and reporting.  Several measures should be developed and tested within a vessel group noted above.    
Deliverables
The primary deliverables on this project are the recommendations on which measures were most effective for a given fishery component, and a report on research, development, and field assessment procedures and activities.

The report should include the following:
-	Design Phase: types of measures considered, and selection procedure used to decide which measure to test.
-	Fabrication: costs and vendors involved in the fabrication of measures.  If materials are readily available on the market, note so in the report.
-	Logistics: how each vessel involved in the study was fitted out for the measures, costs involved, and any problems that were encountered.  Note how problems were addressed.
-	Assessment – operational: Comment on how crew safety was ensured and note any risks posed by the measures, the ease with which the crew could deploy and retrieve the measures, and the overall durability and dependability of the measures
-	Assessment -- effectiveness: Methods used to evaluate seabird interaction rates with third wires and/or trawl cables as appropriate.  The report should include interaction rates with and without measures, and comments on effectiveness of the measures under the variables noted above (weather conditions, sea state, juxtaposition to offal field, etc.).
Schedule for Period of Performance
Design should begin shortly after award.  Simple designs should be deployed and tested as soon as possible whereas those that require more lead time can be tested later.  Field testing should incorporate different seasons where possible.  It is expected that within one year of award the design and assessment will be completed.  Analysis of the monitoring data should occur within two months of completion of field work.  A report will be due within 18 months of the award date and include the information noted above.  A specific schedule will be agreed on shortly after award.  Bids that propose to complete the project in less time while maintaining overall quality will be considered superior.  
Evaluation Factors
Proposals will be evaluated using the criteria noted below.  While preference will be provided to industry associations, owners of vessels who submit a superior proposal and whose vessel is reasonably representative of the particular fishery component will be considered.  Bidders can leverage their proposals by noting any design discussions already completed.  Where possible, government funds available will pay for the entire proposal. However, should these funds prove insufficient to fully support a superior proposal, a willingness by the vendor to provide partial or full matching funds will be considered important.  Funds will support as much as one bid as is possible.  
The technical aspect of proposals will primarily be evaluated on:
1.  Ability to provide several vessel=s to explore different mitigation measures.
2.  How representative the vessels are to one of the two fishery components noted above.
3.  Quality of overall proposal, including how the vendor plans to address the design, fabrication, and assessment stages.
4.  Ability to address the deliverables noted above.
5.  Qualifications of key personnel
6.  Previous work completed on developing seabird/trawl mitigation measures.
7.  Proposed timeline for project milestones and overall completion.
Projected costs will also be considered and evaluated.  If available government funds cannot fully support a proposal that is considered technically superior, the bidder will be contacted to determine whether cost-sharing is possible.  Cost-sharing, if necessary, will be considered before final decisions are made.  Bidders should note in their proposal whether they would entertain sharing costs on this work.
Recommendation for Bidders.
While government funds are available for this cooperative research, they may not be enough to pay for all aspects of the work.  Bidders should structure their proposal such that estimates are provided for each major phase of the project.  This procurement will cover as much of the cost as is possible, but final award may be based on the ability for the bidder to provide partial or matching funds.  Where possible, government funds will pay for the overall project.  Should a surplus exist after bid award, components of additional proposals may be considered. 
Although preference will be given to bids from industry associations, individual vessel owners are welcome to apply as well.  
Data Confidentiality.
At the time of this writing we have sought guidance from NOAA General Counsel on confidentiality of the raw data and data monitoring aspects.  It is expected that the final interaction rates and seabird mortalities will be reported, by species, in the final report and are as such public information.  The advice we seek is whether the raw data from monitoring activities are also public information should the vendor provide their own matching funds to address this component of the study.  That issue should be resolved prior to final negotiations and bid award.

<DESC>This synopsis is being posted to both the Federal Business Opportunities(FBO) page located at http://www.eps.gov and the Navy Electronic Commerce on Line(NECO) site located at http://www.neco.navy.mil.  While it is understood that FBO is the single point of entry for posting of synopsis and solicitations to the internet, NECO is the alternative in case FBO is unavailable.  Please feel free to use either site to access information posted by the Navy Sea Systems Command. This is a modification to combined synopsis/solicitation #N66604-04-Q-6068.  Question:  Is the depth given in the specifications the maximum depth of the case for the computer?  Answer:  Yes, the depth is the maximum.  Question:  The unit is a 5U (8.75 inches) – Does the height restriction include the monitor/keyboard assy or is that a separate allowance (1U – 1.75 inch or 2U – 3.50 inch)?
Answer:  Yes, the height restriction is including the keyboard/mouse and monitor.  Question:  Is it ok to upgrade the size of the monitor?  The type and size and monitor is no longer a generally available item and would have to be custom manufactured and would not be ready in the delivery time allowed.
Answer:  Yes, the monitor can be upgraded.  Question:  Synopsis states “internet speaker”.  Was this a typo?  Answer:  Yes, it should read “internal speaker”.  Evaluation factors are technical capability, price and past performance.  Each is equally important.  Offers should include price and delivery terms and the following additional information:  technical capability and configurations.  Offers must be received by 2:00 p.m. on 09/20/2004.
