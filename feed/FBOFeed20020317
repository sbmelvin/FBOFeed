 SPECIFICATION FOR SMALL ARMS RANGES

BULLET TRAP 
AND 
CONTAINMENT SYSTEM

BASIC STRUCTURE:
1. Trap shall be suitable for use as a self-contained, self-supporting, bullet backstop on indoor or outdoor ranges.

2. Trap shall be of all-steel construction for heavy use on high-volume ranges.  Trap shall not be constructed of permeable or flammable materials such as rubber, wood, plastics etc.

3. Trap shall, without allowing bullet penetration, without sustaining other damage and without reflecting bullet splatter, be capable of stopping and containing the following projectiles (and others of equivalent power factor and penetration factor) when fired at a ?point bland? distance from the front aperture of the trap: 9mm, 45 cal, .223 fmj, 5.56 fmj, 3.08 fmj, 7.62 fmj, 7mm Rem Mag, 12ga buckshot, 12ga rifled slug.

4. Trap shall, without impairing its functionality, be capable of stopping armor piercing rounds (green tips and/or 5.56mm M885) up through and including .223 cal., and .50 cal. Hardball.

5. Trap shall be fully modular such that it may be assembled on site, or disassembled and move.  Assembly shall not require ?permanent? connection means such as welding, riveting etc.  Assembly shall not require cutting of materials or other sizing operations.  Rather, all modules shall be completely pre-fabricated for simple assembly on site.  All modules shall be small enough to be carried through a standard 30? doorway.  No single module shall weigh more than 250lbs.

6. Trap may be ordered with any horizontal centerline height from 24? to 72? off the ground.  Trap may be ordered with any front aperture height from 48? to 96?.

7. Trap shall utilize steel deflector plates to direct the bullet into an enclosed, fully shielded (solid steel in 360 degrees) chamber where its velocity is safely removed.  Deceleration shall occur in free-air and not in any other medium such as rubber, water, etc.  Chamber shall be readily accessible and inspectable without requiring prior removal of any king of internal deceleration medium.

8. Deceleration chamber shall be composed of steel impact plates which may be readily serviced or replaced on site without requiring disassembly of any trap support superstructure.

9. No deflector plate surfaces shall present a bullet fired straight into the trap with an impact at an angle greater than 15 degrees from parallel with the plate.

10. Bullet components with have lost their momentum will be directed into a series of containment canisters.  Each canister shall be connected to the trap by means of an airtight seal.  Each canister shall be removed form the trap by means of a single wing nut.  Containment canisters shall have a total volume not to exceed 4 gallons.

11. Each canister shall employ a permanently locking, airtight lid.  Once the canister is filled with lead, it may be removed from the trap and the lid secured in place.  The canister may them be used to contain the lead permanently, or during transit to recycling.  Canisters which have been returned shall be able to be reused on the trap.  The canister changing procedure shall not require the operator to touch the contained lead particulate.

12. Trap lane modules shall be available in standard widths of 48? and 60?.  Said lane modules shall combine together in any number and in any combination of widths to form a single, contiguous aperture the full width of the trap.

13. Any vertical joins which interconnect adjacent modules and direct border-line impacts into one containment module or the other shall not be disposed at or near the front edge of the trap and shall occupy no more than 10% of the total aperture height of the trap.

14. Trap shall not require prior construction of support walls either on the back or sides.  Rather all such support shall be inherent in the structure of the trap.

15. For installation within an existing structure, trap shall not be installed flush with walls, but rather shall be set in at least 36? on the rear and 12? on each side to allow full, unrestricted service and inspection access to all surfaces of the structure, even after complete assemble.

SITE SPECIFIC OPTIONS:
16. Basic trap shall require no prior construction or site preparation other than a flat, concrete pad (6? thick, 6000psi concrete).    --or--   basic trap shall require no prior construction or site preparation other than a than a flat, concrete pad (4? thick, 4000psi concrete), and an overhead support structure capable of hearing an average distributed load of 15 lbs. per sq. ft. and providing attachment means roughly every 4 ft. over the area of the trap.

17. Trap shall be furnished complete with installation to be performed by the original manufacturer. 

18. Trap shall include a corrugated steel roof structure disposed no more than 4? above the trap structure and covering the entire area occupied by the trap.  In addition, said roof shall cover at least 1 ft. on each side of the trap and 3 ft. on the rear or the trap.  Said roof shall be watertight, protecting the trap and service area from precipitation.

19. Trap deceleration unit shall employ an active lead accumulation system to capture and remove airborne lead particulate within and surrounding the chamber.  This system shall then direct captured bullet components into a containment canister where they can be readily removed for disposal or recycling.  Each canister shall be connected to the accumulation system by means of an airtight seal.

20. Each canister shall employ a locking, airtight lid.  Once the canister is filled with lead, it may be removed from the trap and the lid secured in place.  The canister may then be used to contain the lead permanently, or during transit to recycling.  Canisters which have been returned shall be able to be reused on the system.  The canister changing procedure shall not require the operator to touch the contained lead particulate.

21. Trap shall employ an air collection and filtration system to collect and purify the air surrounding the trap and within the main deflection aperture.  Air shall flow into the bullet deceleration chamber at an average rate of at least 37 cfm for each linear foot of trap.  The velocity of air entering each chamber shall be at least 450 fpm through whatever aperture (s) provided.  Transport velocity en-route to the purification apparatus shall be no less than 3000 fpm.

22. Said purification apparatus shall process the required airflow at efficiency exceeding 99.99% on 1 micron particulate and exceeding 99.9% on 0.12 micron particulate.

23. Said purification apparatus shall be self-cleaning.  Any filter elements which are disposable shall have an average life expectancy of 4 years or more.  The procedure for replacing said elements shall no require the operator to come in contact with any lead particulate on the element.

24. An optional second stage, redundant HEPA grade filtration system shall be available which shall filter all air processed by the primary filtration system.  The HEPA filter shall exceed 99.99% efficiency on 0.12-micron particulate.

<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command's (USASMDC's) Directed Energy Technology Program Office has a requirement for additional effort to develop, implement and test modifications that will provide the THEL Demonstrator with a limited operational capability (LOC).  These efforts are collectively referred to as “Complete the Demonstrator (CTD)” activities.  The CTD activities are a follow-on to a contract for development test and evaluation (DT&E) of the THEL Demonstrator.  The THEL Demonstrator is a one-of-a-kind system developed by TRW, Incorporated, under a US/Israeli cooperative research program pursued as an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration  (ACTD) program.  Pursuant to 10 USC 2304(d)(1)(B) and FAR 6.302-1(a)(2)(ii), USASMDC plans to aw ard a modification to an existing contract on a sole source basis to TRW, Incorporated, of Redondo Beach, California.  The proposed additional CTD activities will be the continuation of a phased program to evaluate the effectiveness of a THEL in negating t he threat poised by Katyusha and other short-range artillery rockets .  These efforts are integral to and are so closely intertwined with the development of the Demonstrator to date as to be essentially non-severable.  These efforts build on the prior work  of TRW and it has been determined that award to any other source would result in a substantial duplication of cost to the Government not expected to be recovered by competition.  The effort, to be perfomed in 2002, will be awarded as soon as possible to a ssure continued performance of CTD activities. A SECRET facility clearance is required for this effort.  Written responses must cite this notice and be submitted to the U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command, ATTN: SMDC-CM-AK/Mr. O. Wayne Koger, P.O. Box 1500, Huntsville, AL 35807-3801.
