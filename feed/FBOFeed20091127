The hardware procured must match current production hardware to test the processes for firmware updates, IOS security updates, and network access control.  Valid testing cannot be conducted unless similar hardware is procured.  These same Layer 3 switch types are core equipment for command and control systems and our laboratory must be able to perform forensics and advanced troubleshooting of hardware related issues. The memory upgrade for existing Cisco equipment being utilized in the laboratory must match the memory modules currently in the switches or unexpected performance, and even failure, may result from the incompatible modules.  This may result in having to replace the entire switch at a much higher price to the government.
An added advantage of procuring similar equipment currently used in our infrastructure is after our lab evaluation process, the entire inventory of switches/routers may not need to be maintained for O&M purposes.  Since they mimic our current production environment, this equipment can then be re-configured and added to the DoS current spares inventory.  There is another unique O&M feature utilized in our current network environment called Cisco works.  This software allows you to remotely update configurations and firmware on a Cisco switch environment for greater security and access.  This software will not integrate with other brands of switches.IRM/OPS/ENM will purchase:	1- Cisco WS-C2960G-48TC-L	34-128MB Flash (Cisco approved) for existing Cisco 3725 	12-256MB DRAM  (Cisco approved) for existing Cisco 3745. IRM requires the Cisco Catalyst switches for the NAC/PS and EECM laboratory and future use in the production environment. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible brand and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c), is cited as the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements for a laboratory designed to test NAC/PS and EECM solutions based on the Department of States (DoS) production environment.  The hardware procured must match current production hardware to test the processes for operating system security updates, and network access control features.  Valid testing cannot be conducted unless similar hardware is procured.<BR><BR>Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  A)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. B)  Seller is providing these products via Cisco authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  C) Full Cisco warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>To Bid on this opportunity, Seller must be Cisco Gold, Silver or Premier Partners.

<DESC>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has a requirement to obtain contractor support to aid in code integration, assessment, and application of an evaluation model for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) Project in the reactor systems analysis area, to include aiding in code integration, assessment, and application of an evaluation model for the NGNP in the reactor systems analysis area.  The principal deliverables of this contract will be: (1) an integrated code suite that composes the NGNP evaluation model, (2) an implementation of an uncertainty methodology for this EM, and (3) a code applicability report for the application of this EM to the NGNP design.  The code applicability report will be similar to those produced for the analyses of the ESBWR and the AP-1000 designs with the TRACE code.  The scope of this contract will be limited to code integration, assessment, and application of an Evaluation Model for the NGNP in the area of reactor/plant systems analysis, including thermal-fluid dynamics, nuclear analysis, accident fission product transport and source-term analysis.  The performance of this contract will require close collaboration with other NRC contractors as development of the individual codes from which the EM will be assembled may be performed elsewhere.  

NRC intends to award a single award indefinite quantity/indefinite delivery task order contract. As tasks are identified, NRC will issue individual task order statements of work that specify objectives, scope, deliverables, schedule, and other requirements.  

The solicitation is expected to be posted on or about December 14, 2009. The solicitation package is only available through FEDBIZOPS.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO)contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US Territories and Possessions, and international locations.  Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.  Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point services, switched services, domestic and international long distance services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically 3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.  If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements, and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.  The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement, DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.  The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these telecommunications services requirements is 517110.

<DESC>The U.S. Coast Guard is considering whether or not to set aside an acquisition for HUBZone concerns, Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concerns (SDVOSB), or for Small Businesses.  The small business size standard for NAICS 336611 is less than 1,000 employees.  The acquisition is to perform emergency drydock and repairs to the USCGC HERON (WPB-87344), an 87 foot patrol boat.  The homeport of the vessel is Sabine Pass, Texas.  The performance period is ten (10) calendar days and is expected to begin on or about December 14, 2009.  The vessel’s availability will be geographically restricted to a facility located within the near coastal waters of the gulf coast and Mobile, Alabama or Corpus Christi, Texas.  No open water transit.  

The scope of the acquisition is for the overhauling, renewing and repairing of various items aboard the USCGC HERON (WPB-87344).  This work will include, but is not limited to: realign main engine/reduction gear, remove, inspect, and reinstall propeller shafts, remove, inspect, and reinstall propellers, remove, inspect, and reinstall rudder assemblies, non-routine drydocking, provide temp logistics, composite labor, GFP report, and laydays.

All welding and brazing shall be accomplished by trained welders, who have been certified by the applicable regulatory code performance qualification procedures.  In accordance with FAR 19.1305 and FAR 19.1405, if your firm is HUBZone certified or a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business and intends to submit an offer on this acquisition, please respond in a letter either by e-mail to tomeka.evans@uscg.mil or by fax at (757) 628-4676.  In your response you must include (a) a positive statement of your intention to submit a bid for this solicitation as a prime contractor; (b) evidence of experience in work similar in type and scope to include contract numbers, project titles, dollar amounts, points of contact and telephone numbers; (c) past performance references with points of contact and telephone numbers.  At least two references are requested, but more are desirable.  Your response is required by November 30, 2009 at 2:30 pm, EST.   Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a HubZone set aside, FAR 52.219-3, Notice of Total HubZone Set-aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  Contractors are reminded that should this acquisition become a Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, FAR 52.219-27, Notice of Total Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Set-Aside, will apply, which requires that at least 50 percent of the cost of personnel for contract performance be spent for employees of the concern.  All of the above must be submitted in sufficient detail for a decision to be made on a HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business set aside, or Small Business set-aside.  Failure to submit all information requested may result in an unrestricted acquisition.  A decision on whether this will be pursued as a HUBZone, SDVOSB set-aside, or small business set-aside, will be posted in the Fedbizopps website at http://www.fedbizopps.gov.  Questions may be referred to Mr. Louis Romano at (757) 628-4651.

<DESC>Contract No. 70181AM041
TAS: 14 1351 0000
United States Department of the InteriorJustification of Other than Full and Open Competition Under $25,000
1) Briefly, a description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency's needs and include the estimated value.The contractor will review legal briefs and oral argument presentations, defending the Government Action of listing the polar bear as a threatened species under the ESA, for technical accuracy. "Technical accuracy" includes accuracy with respect to the climate and polar bear science addressed in the briefs. The contractor is also expected to provide a direct perspective in addressing specific legal challenges. Specifically, the contractor will review and deliver two draft briefs with comments. These two briefs, for contract purposes, will correspond with the Service's litigation response dates: December 7, 2009 and April 8, 2010.
As an optional item to the purchase order, The contractor will review the Service and DOJ's oral argument presentations for technical edits and accuracy, with respect to the climate and polar bear science research that was provided for the initial 4(d) ruling. The Service's oral arguments are expected to occur the summer/fall of 2010. Price and schedule will be negotiated at a later date.
2)  Statutory Authority  permitting other than full and open competition. Identify the statutory authority permitting with the FAR citation and FAR citation Title. FAR 6.302-1, Only one responsible source and no other supplies or services will satisfy agency requirements. FAR 6.302-2, Unusual and compelling urgency.FAR 6.302-3, Industrial mobilization; engineering, developmental, or research capability; or expert services. 
3) WHY are the proposed contractor's unique qualifications for the nature of the acquisition requiring the use of the authority cited in item (2). Mr. Scott Schliebe is uniquely qualified to assist the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of Justice to prepare briefs and oral arguments in defending the government action of listing the polar bear as a threatened species under the ESA. This listing determination was prepared, reviewed, and edited by Mr. Schliebe. He, alone, has the perspective to place documents within a contextual framework of the listing process. Without Mr. Schliebe's immediate assistance, the Government would suffer serious injury because it cannot reasonably obtain an expert to review and respond to the December 7 legal brief. Furthermore, the agency cannot replace Mr. Schliebe's four years of preparing the listing determination. Mr. Schliebe's expertise is essential to the Service's current litigation, as he will assist the Government in analysis of the claims. The Service is compelled to file its complete responses and oral arguments to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in a timely fashion and failing to include Mr. Schliebe's unique contributions to our defense we risk irreparable harm in this litigation action.
4) WHAT effort was made to ensure that offers were solicited from as many potential sources as is practical. The issuance of this contract is a unique situation and an instance in which it is not possible to obtain competition. As noted above Mr. Schliebe is uniquely qualified to meet the Service's needs and to provide the scope and frame of reference to the Department of Justice's trial attorneys. While the Service has committed considerable effort to providing review and insight into the record documents, Mr. Schliebe services are required to ensure the listing action of the polar bear is accurately and completely described in the Government's arguments rebutting various litigants assertions as to the veracity and robustness of our listing action. Furthermore, as the Government prepares its own filings, to defend the listing, Mr. Schliebe's direct understanding of the various components associated with listing are more completely conveyed to the Court. The Service has also vested significant effort and expense in the coalition and preparation of the administrative listing record, without Mr. Schliebe's intimate understanding of the documents in that record the Government's ability to present its case to the Court is compromised. 
5) A Description of the Market survey conducted and the results. Service employees contacted three trial attorneys to inquire if they knew of any method for obtaining the services of someone who was not familiar with a filing and directly and materially associated with an action to provide them with background and scope of understanding. All three attorneys indicated that without a doubt, and in order to present to the Court the most complete understanding of a particular activity, they would seek insight from those directly involved.

<DESC><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS NOTICE IS PROVIDED FOR INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY.<br /></span>This effort is being pursued under an existing Agency contract.<br /></strong>The purpose of this Modification 37 is to obligate $100,000 in initial funding in support of Work Assignment 2-202 and Amendment 2 to Work Assignment 2-201. The period of performance for Work Assignment 2-202 will be from November 5, 2009 though September 30, 2010. The period of Performance of WA 2-201 remains from July 29 through September 30, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WA 2-202 of Contract EP-C-05-046 will have the contractor support EPA in providing needed technical and engineering support to EPA Region III in its oversight of the District of Columbia in order to ensure successful implementation of the ARRA requirements and achievement of the ARRA deadline that projects are under contract or construction on or before February 17, 2010.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">WA 2-201 of Contract EP-C-05-046 will have the contractor assist EPA in providing ways to increase information sharing and improve collaboration between EPA Regions, EPA Headquarters and the Indian Health Service (IHS) working on Clean Water Indian Set Aside (CWISA) projects using ARRA funds. Amendment 2 adds necessary support for pre-meeting and post-meeting activities to be conducted under the work assignment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using appropriated funds from the Act, including the need for acquisitions to be in accordance with the FAR and, to the maximum extent practicable, awarded as fixed-price (FP) contracts using competitive procedures. However, the Office of Management and Budget's guidance allows for the use of other than FP contracts. Although the Agency's Office of Water (OW) contracts were not awarded as FP contracts, they were awarded competitively, and each contract structure was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed. The existing OW contracts have sufficient qualified acquisition personnel to provide appropriate contract administration and oversight to monitor contract performance to mitigate the Government's risk. In order to meet the requirements of the Act in the most prudent business manner within the time constraints imposed, existing OW contracts are the most appropriate contractual vehicles consistent with Agency plans that promote the goals of the ARRA.</p>

THIS OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE ONLY TO CONTRACTOR(S) UNDER THE CURRENT CONTRACT NUMBER(S): R&D Maintenance Services, Contract Number W91278-08-C-0013<br><br>The Mobile District Corps of Engineers intends to issue a modification using Recovery Act funding to contract number W91278-08-C-0013, a competitively awarded Cost-Reimbursable Plus Award-Fee contract for the Operation and Maintenance of Government-Owned Facilities and Equipment, Allatoona Lake Project, Cartersville, Georgia, awarded to R&D Maintenance Services, Inc., P.O. Box 815 Hennessey, OK. Utilizing American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds, the modification will increase the level of effort originally contracted for, to increase costs associated with upgrading selected campsites to 50 amp electrical service as a result of unforeseen site conditions. This work is within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and includes maintaining and repairing buildings, structures, facilities, and their mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sewage and water systems.  Contract clauses required for projects involving Recovery Act funds have been incorporated into the existing contract. <BR><BR>This existing contract must be used for the following reasons: 1) The contractor is already in the midst of the job and this modification is to add funding needed to complete the job as a result of unforeseen site conditions.  2) A detailed scope of work can not be prepared. The extent of the work and the resources needed can not be fully determined prior to starting the work, because conditions are different at each individual site. 3) The contractor is responsible for the complete inspection, maintenance, and repair of all project buildings and structures in the Allatoona recreation area. 4) The scheduling, coordination, quality assurance, and/or subcontracting for the work to be performed are within the scope of the original contract technical provisions and must be accomplished under the terms of the existing contract. The incumbent contractor not only has the management, technical, and administrative skills to efficiently accomplish this work at a reasonable cost, but also the advantage of the flexibility to readily adjust to any unforeseen obstacles encountered during installation. 5) This contract enables repairs to begin immediately after and during inspections without a detailed scope of work and thus minimizes the time the facilities are closed and the impact on public assess to camping and recreation during the busiest season of the year.<BR><BR>The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) contains specific acquisition requirements that must be met when using funds appropriated by the Act.  Acquisitions must comply with FAR, and to the maximum extent practicable, be awarded under competitive procedures as fixed-price (FP) contracts.  The Mobile District intends to use the current CPAF contract to meet it requirements.  Though not a FP contract, it was awarded competitively as a small business set aside.  The contract type was selected to provide the contractor with the greatest incentive for efficient and economical performance, given the types of services to be performed.  Furthermore, the existing Operation and Maintenance contractor has experienced personnel that are already on site and ready to perform the work.  Accordingly, it is deemed to be in the best interest of the government and in compliance with the goals of the Recovery Act to use the existing Operation and Maintenance contract to accomplish the requirements listed above. <BR>

<DESC>DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DoD) SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) PROGRAM 2010.1. Small high-technology firms are encouraged to submit proposals to DoD for R&amp;D projects with both military and commercial applications in response to SBIR solicitation 2010.1, which will be publicly released on the DoD SBIR Web Site (http://www.acq.osd.mil/sadbu/sbir) on Nov 12, 2009. The 2010.1 SBIR Solicitation will open for receipt of proposals on Dec 10, 2009 and will close at 6:00 AM EASTERN TIME, Jan 13, 2010. NOTE: Proposals received after the specified due date and time shall be governed by the provisions of FAR 52.215-1(c)(3). Submissions must include the proposal cover sheets, technical proposal, Company Commercialization Report, and cost proposal to be considered a complete proposal. Seven DoD components will participate in the&nbsp;2010.1 solicitation - the Department of the Air Force, Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Chemical and Biological Defense Program (CBD), Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM). The solicitation lists all the R&amp;D topics under which DoD is seeking proposals, and also contains detailed information on the parameters of the SBIR program and how to submit a proposal. Small firms apply first for a six-month phase I award of $70,000 to $100,000 (unless otherwise specified in the component instructions) to test the scientific, technical, and commercial merit of a particular concept. If phase I proves successful, the firm may be invited to apply for a two-year phase II award of $500,000 to $750,000 to further develop the concept. Proposals must be submitted via the DOD SBIR website at http://www.dodsbir.net/submission following the instructions contained in the solicitation, including the instructions specified in the solicitation for the DoD component to which you are applying. Offerors bear the risk of website inaccessibility due to heavy usage in the final hours before the solicitation closing time, so plan ahead and submit early. The complete solicitation may be accessed at http://www.dodsbir.net/solicitation. Participation in the DoD SBIR Program is restricted to small business firms organized for profit with 500 or fewer employees, including all affiliated firms. Questions may be directed to the SBIR/STTR Help Desk at (866) 724-7457 or Mr. Joseph Misanin at (703) 604-0157 x 183, or by e-mail: Joseph.Misanin@osd.mil or Ms. Amy Smith, Contracting Officer at (937) 255-0493, e-mail amy.smith@wpafb.af.mil.

The hardware procured must match current production hardware to test the processes for firmware updates, IOS security updates, and network access control.  Valid testing cannot be conducted unless similar hardware is procured.  These same Layer 3 switch types are core equipment for command and control systems and our laboratory must be able to perform forensics and advanced troubleshooting of hardware related issues. The memory upgrade for existing Cisco equipment being utilized in the laboratory must match the memory modules currently in the switches or unexpected performance, and even failure, may result from the incompatible modules.  This may result in having to replace the entire switch at a much higher price to the government.
An added advantage of procuring similar equipment currently used in our infrastructure is after our lab evaluation process, the entire inventory of switches/routers may not need to be maintained for O&M purposes.  Since they mimic our current production environment, this equipment can then be re-configured and added to the DoS current spares inventory.  There is another unique O&M feature utilized in our current network environment called Cisco works.  This software allows you to remotely update configurations and firmware on a Cisco switch environment for greater security and access.  This software will not integrate with other brands of switches.IRM/OPS/ENM will purchase:	1- Cisco WS-C2960G-48TC-L	34-128MB Flash (Cisco approved) for existing Cisco 3725 	12-256MB DRAM  (Cisco approved) for existing Cisco 3745. IRM requires the Cisco Catalyst switches for the NAC/PS and EECM laboratory and future use in the production environment. Therefore, 41 USC 253(c)(1), only one responsible brand and no other supplies will satisfy agency requirements, implemented by Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 6.302-1(c), is cited as the statutory authority.As this is a brand name only justification, no one contractors unique qualifications are cited as the basis for this justification.  Rather, the products identified by brand name herein have been determined to be the only items that meet the Departments requirements for a laboratory designed to test NAC/PS and EECM solutions based on the Department of States (DoS) production environment.  The hardware procured must match current production hardware to test the processes for operating system security updates, and network access control features.  Valid testing cannot be conducted unless similar hardware is procured.<BR><BR>Sellers must bid exact match to spec (make, model and spec)  A)The products offered in this bid are brand new, not gray market and are in original packaging. B)  Seller is providing these products via Cisco authorized channels for new equipment Federal sales.  C) Full Cisco warranties will be provided and none of these products will have a negative impact on the warranties of associated system components.<BR><BR>To Bid on this opportunity, Seller must be Cisco Gold, Silver or Premier Partners.
