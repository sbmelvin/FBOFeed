<DESC>Market Survey Announcement for ONE- IT

In accordance with the Federal Aviation Administration Acquisition Management System (FAA AMS), T3.2.1.2, "Market Analysis", industry is hereby notified that Federal Aviation Administration's Washington Headquarters Services/Acquisition Directorate is conducting market research to assess industry capabilities for providing the following Agency wide Agile IT Software development services for the proposed acquisition (as required by the attached Performance Based Statement of Work):

<DESC><br />Introduction<br /><br />THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATION AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND DOES NOT COMMIT THE GOVERNMENT TO AWARD A CONTRACT NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. NO SOLICITATION IS AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. BASED ON CAPABILITY STATEMENTS RECEIVED IN RESPONSE TO THIS SOURCES SOUGHT ANNOUNCEMENT THIS ACQUISITION MAY BE SOLICITED AS A 100% SMALL BUSINESS SET-ASIDE. ALL SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS (SB, SDB, WOSB, HUBZone, VOSB, and SDVOSB) ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND TO THIS NOTICE. SMALL BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS MUST HAVE THEIR SIZE STATUS CERTIFIED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION. ALL SMALL BUSINESSES ARE ENCOURAGED TO RESPOND. THE NAICS CODE IS 541711 WITH A SIZE STANDARD OF 500 Employees.<br /><br />Description
<p>This initiative will provide for the continued maintenance, expansion and enhancement of the Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) program (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/LabsAndResources/resources/dmid/brc/Pages/default.aspx). The BRCs have provided the scientific community with publicly accessible systems that store, update, integrate and display genome sequence data and its annotation, functional genomics and other "omics" data, and other associated data and information for a large variety of human pathogens and vectors of human pathogens and related microbial species and strains, and allow users to query and analyze this data with user friendly interfaces and computational analyses tools. The BRCs have become the public repository of data generated by NIAID-supported genomics programs, and other grants and contracts.</p>
<p>Through this new solicitation, continued support of bioinformatics infrastructure and data services for each of the following groups of organisms will be provided:</p>
<p>&bull; bacterial species<br />&bull; viral families<br />&bull; protozoan species and fungi<br />&bull; invertebrate vectors of human pathogens</p>
<p><br />Within the groups above, the targeted organisms are those in NIAID's List of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/emerging/Pages/list.aspx), which includes NIAID Category A-C Priority Pathogens, and their phylogenetically, closely related species with special emphasis on influenza, Mycobacteria tuberculosis (TB), and malaria. Invertebrate vectors of human pathogens are also of interest.</p>
<p>Although proposals that are not directed specifically at the targeted organisms are also responsive to this RFP, offerors must be aware that very limited funding is available for those types of projects.</p>
<p>Upon award, the new contractors will have to ensure an effective transition of the data and software hosted by the incumbent BRCs contractors (see http://www.niaid.nih.gov/LabsAndResources/resources/dmid/brc/Pages/awards.aspx for the current BRC web sites) into the new BRCs.</p>
<p><br />Capability Statement/Information Sought:</p>
<p>Sources are expected to have the expertise, personnel, and facilities to meet requirements of this project. Tailored Capability Statements submitted as a result of this announcement should demonstrate the offerors' qualifications and experience, specifically providing evidence as to their capability to perform this requirement, with particular attention to the following technical areas:</p>
<p>&bull; Maintenance, expansion, and enhancement of the BRC database systems containing integrated data from human pathogens and invertebrate vectors of infectious diseases.<br />&bull; Maintenance, expansion, enhancement, and provision of analysis tools and algorithms for the interpretation, analysis, and visualization of data in the BRCs. Maintenance, expansion, and enhancement of user friendly web interfaces for data query, retrieval, and display. <br />&bull; Provision of bioinformatics services to the scientific community.<br />&bull; Provision of community outreach activities to expand the user-base and increase the utility of the BRC bioinformatics resources. <br />&bull; Interaction with NIAID funded programs to provide bioinformatics support to facilitate data sharing and analysis, and collaborative scientific discoveries.<br />&bull; Provide for an efficient initial and final transition of all the relevant data, database schema, software applications and source codes, analysis tools, all the SOPs and other resources, and all the user manuals and documentation to ensure a seamless transition of the services and operation of the BRC system.<br />Potential sources must demonstrate and document the following in their capability statements:</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to maintain, expand, and enhance a BRC database system containing integrated data from human pathogens and invertebrate vectors of infectious diseases. Ability to support the following types of data and associated metadata:<br />i. Genome sequences, genome annotation, genes and their products, metabolic and biochemical pathways, and other genomic signatures including microbiome metagenomics and related omics data.<br />ii. Clinical isolates data and associated metadata.<br />iii. Data from high throughput molecular characterization technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, proteomics, metabolomics, structure genomics, RNA interference screening, epigenomics, and other emerging "omics" technologies. <br />iv. Data from host-pathogen and host-vector-pathogen interaction studies, including contributing factors from pathogen, vector, host (host responses and host elements), and their interactions. <br />v. Data from population based studies in genetics and genomics, including polymorphisms, mutations, phenotypes, and genotype and phenotype association data.<br />vi. Data from studies on epidemiology, ecology and surveillance of human and animals. <br />vii. Antimicrobial drug resistance data including mono-resistance, multidrug-resistance (MDR) and extensively drug-resistance (XDR), insecticide resistance data, and antigenic data.<br />viii. Immunology and serology data. <br />ix. Data from clinical studies on human pathogens, vectors of human pathogens, and infectious diseases, including information from Case Report Forms and Electronic Health Records, and all relevant metadata.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to support integration of data, as well as associated metadata, across types, projects, sources, and disciplines; across multiple levels of biological understanding from molecule, cell, organism, and population; and across pathogen, vector, and host to bring together many facets of infectious diseases including pathogen, host, clinical phenotype, and diseases information, and to enable multi-scale systems level investigations.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to perform targeted manual curation on data described above from various sources including literature, high-throughput experiments, and other databases.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to develop and implement data standards and ontologies.</p>
<p>&bull; Ability to maintain, expand, enhance, and provide an analysis resources containing algorithms and tools for data mining and reasoning, data integration for automatic exploration and visualization of correlations across data types, exploration of temporal and spatial multivariate data, prediction of pathogen strain risks, modeling of molecular mechanisms and population dynamics of infectious diseases, target identification for antimicrobial therapies and vaccines, and workflow management.</p>
<p>In addition, capability statements should address the following:</p>
<p>Technical Plan/Approach: appropriateness and adequacy of the plans for conducting all the activities described above.</p>
<p>Personnel/Management: adequacy, appropriateness and relevance of expertise, experience, qualifications, and availability of the key professional and technical staff with a project of similar size, scope, and complexity. Required expertise include microbiology, pathogenesis, immunology, clinical studies, and infectious diseases related to the proposed group of organisms; management of complex scientific research project involving multidisciplinary team members, IT systems, network architecture, and computational analysis software applications and development, including bioinformatics, information technology administration, software engineering, computational biology; high-throughput "-omics" technologies; and other experimental approaches that generate data types supported by the proposed BRC. Offerors must demonstrate that the proposed key personnel and other staff have sufficient scientific leadership and expertise in the various biology and infectious disease domains described above and related to the proposed group of organisms.</p>
<p>It is estimated that fourteen (14) Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs)/2080 work hours per year, including subcontractor and consultant personnel, will be required.</p>
<p>Facilities/Resources/IT Security: adequacy, appropriateness of the facilities and resources dedicated to the project; of the Operational Recovery Plan (ORP) and Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP); security against catastrophic loss of data or important software; and the provision of uninterrupted access and service to the BRC user community.</p>

Sole source determination is based on OCIO's  requirements to have continuous uninterrupted corporate administrative, financial and management services to NOAA and the greater Commerce community. Connect Direct is a proprietary product of IBM and is only supported by them.   A change in product or support would disrupt the critical requirements for Electronic Fund Transfer mandated by Federal Law as well as interrupt service or require a new infrastructure costing time and money.   IBM is the vendor that provides service to the NOAA/OCIO and is designed to work specifically with the Commerce Business System.  Justification for sole source is included in this notice.<br />This notice is is not to be considered a request for proposal or for quotation. No solicitation document is available. THIS IS NOT A SOLICITATION FOR PROPOSALS.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a competitive basis is solely within the discretion of the Government.<br />

<DESC><p><strong>THIS IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.</strong> The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) intends to conduct a full and open competition under the authority of 10 USC 2304 (a) and in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Part 15 for the Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program (VXX). NAVAIR will not be using the provisions of FAR Part 12 for this acquisition. The Government is hereby releasing a Draft Request for Proposal (RFP), including sections L&amp;M. Please note that Section M currently does not contain the evaluation factor order of importance. Industry input is being sought prior to the release of the Formal RFP, which is anticipated in the mid FY 2013 timeframe. <br /><br />Publicly releasable unclassified documentation, to include the Draft RFP Sections A-M, has been posted herein and on the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage website. All subsequent Draft RFP amendments and publicly releasable documentation will reside on FedBizOpps and the NAVAIR Open Solicitation Homepage website. It is recommended that interested Offerors check these sites frequently for any updates. <br /><br />A Pre-solicitation Conference (commonly referred to as "Industry Day") will be conducted to afford Offerors an opportunity to ask additional clarifying questions on the Draft RFP. Instructions are included in this notice on how to submit comments, clarifying questions and responses associated with the Draft RFP.<br /><br />This announcement is not a contract, request for proposal, a promise to contract, or a commitment of any kind on the part of the Government. The Navy will not assume liability for costs incurred by an attendee or for travel expenses or marketing efforts; therefore, attendee cost in response to this notice is not considered an allowable direct charge to the Government.<br /><br /><strong>VXX Program Information:<br /><br /></strong>The VXX aircraft will replace the aging VH-3D and VH-60N aircraft used to support the Presidential vertical lift mission requirements. VXX will be a critical, national-level platform that provides a survivable and dependable worldwide transportation capability and enables the strategic information superiority necessary to execute the duties of the President as the Commander-in-Chief, Chief Executive, and Head of State. The VXX will provide a comprehensive and secure communications capability to ensure connectivity between the President and U.S. Government agencies or foreign governments, throughout the threat spectrum, regardless of location. The VXX Acquisition Strategy is based on the integration of mature subsystems into an existing air vehicle.</p>
<p>Offerors will be highly encouraged to propose an existing, in-production helicopter platform from which the VXX will be derived. It is the Government's desire to hold development to an absolute minimum on the VXX Program and focus the program effort on integration of mature subsystems on a mature platform. While minor changes to the platform to accommodate integration of subsystems are inevitable, change to major components such as drive train, rotors, engines and basic structure is highly discouraged. In keeping with this approach, the Offerors will be encouraged to not propose any design elements that contain immature technology or that might be deemed Critical Technology Elements (CTEs).</p>
<p>The baseline aircraft from which the VXX will be derived should be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a recognized civil airworthiness authority (with bi-lateral agreement with the FAA), United States (U.S.) Military airworthiness certification authority or possess a clear, imminent path (to be demonstrated by the Offeror) to such certification if and when any proposals are submitted in response to a formal solicitation. The Government does not intend to impose bottom-up airworthiness criteria that would drive redesign, but plans to leverage the current certification basis with the cognizant civil or U.S. Military airworthiness certification authority to achieve a NAVAIR flight clearance. The Prime Contractor will be responsible for: 1) obtaining delta certification of the integrated VXX platform from the original certification authority, and 2) maintaining continued airworthiness certification of the integrated VXX platform with the original certification authority. In the event that the original certification authority is a foreign entity, certain elements of the VXX integration will require certification by a U.S. certification authority without the involvement of the original certification authority. For subsystems/components which the original certification authority will not or cannot certify, NAVAIR will provide delta certification of only those subsystems/components as long as such delta certification will not invalidate the certifications from the original certification authority.</p>
<p>The Presidential Helicopters Program Office (PMA-274) is currently partnering with the Naval Air Warfare Center - Aircraft Division (NAWC-AD) St. Inigoes, MD to assemble an executive communications suite using existing off-the-shelf components that will meet the communications subsystem requirements of the VXX Program. This VXX Mission Communications System (MCS) will incorporate existing "state of the art" analog radio terminals and encryption equipment in use today and expand that capability by providing a digital, Internet Protocol (IP)-based network architecture using currently available hardware. Other NAVAIR programs continue to develop and field other specialized mission systems into a variety of platforms, which will be leveraged for the VXX. The MCS and other specialized mission systems constitute the Government-defined subsystems to be integrated on the VXX platform.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Prime Contractor will have primary responsibility for the executive cabin interior, the overall performance of the VXX integrated air vehicle (IAV) and the installed performance of all subsystems on the platform, to include the Government-defined subsystems. <br /><br />Offerors are encouraged to point out to the Government areas in this Draft RFP where it is believed that stated requirements are counter to the approach described above. At a minimum, NAVAIR is seeking feedback on the following areas:</p>
<p><strong>Performance Based Specification (PBS) Requirements:<br /></strong>&bull;&nbsp; Achievability and consistency with the Acquisition Strategy of minimizing development<br />&bull;&nbsp; Tailoring approach, instructions and viability<br />&bull;&nbsp; System level impacts of classified requirements (delayed response)<br /><strong>Mission Communications System Integration:<br /></strong>&bull;&nbsp; Approach for Government Furnished Equipment (GFE)<br />&bull;&nbsp; Clarity of Architecture and boundaries<br />&bull;&nbsp; Technical Data Package (TDP) maturation plan and timeline<br />&bull;&nbsp; Allocation of PBS requirements/responsibility for installed performance<br /><strong>C-17 Transportability Load Demonstration:<br /></strong>&bull;&nbsp; Feasibility and execution issues<br />&bull;&nbsp; Impact, if any, on Offerors given demonstration location<br /><strong>Airworthiness:<br /></strong>&bull;&nbsp; Clarity of approach, process and responsibilities with Original Certification Authority and NAVAIR delta certification<br />&bull;&nbsp; Understanding of the deliverables requested in the RFP<br /><strong>Test:<br /></strong>&bull;&nbsp; Delineation between airworthiness testing and PBS verification testing</p>
<p><strong>Contract Type:<br /></strong>Currently, the Production IAV and Interim Contractor Support (ICS) Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) are Fixed Price Incentive Firm (FPIF). Offerors are requested to provide input on its preference of contract type for the Production IAV and ICS CLINs, either Firm-Fixed Price (FFP) or FPIF. Offerors are encouraged to include a brief narrative regarding any perceived risks associated with either option. Offerors should be aware that an FPIF contract type for the Production Option CLINs will include the Earned Value Management, cost estimating and reporting tasks outlined in Section J, Attachment (3) "Production Statement of Work for the Presidential Helicopter Replacement Program (VXX)," paragraph 1.9 Earned Value Management Requirements. Additionally, the draft RFP includes Department of Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) clauses 252.211-7003, 252.211-7007, and 252.245-7001; however, the Presidential Helicopters Program Office is currently seeking relief from certain aspects of these requirements. In the event relief is provided, the draft solicitation will be revised accordingly. <br /><br /><strong>General Information:<br /></strong><br />The VXX Program includes controlled unclassified technical information that is designated as "For Official Use Only" (FOUO). In accordance with DODI 5230.24, <br />"Distribution Statements on Technical Documents" (23 August 2012), the VXX program applies "Distribution Statement F" to all technical documents to restrict third party dissemination. Unclassified documentation with distribution statement restrictions will be made available through a secure website that will serve as an unclassified virtual bidders' technical library. Other documentation to include Industry Day briefs, the voluntary interested vendors list, and Industry Day Questions and Answers will be posted to this library as well. Access to the Technical Library requires a DoD Common Access Card (CAC) or External Certification Authority (ECA) certificate and a PMA-274 Integrated Digital Environment (IDE) account. An ECA certificate can be obtained from IdenTrust, Inc., Operational Research Consultants, Inc. (ORC) or VeriSign, Inc. Additional information on obtaining an ECA certificate is available at http://iase.disa.mil/pki/eca/index.html.</p>
<p>To request access to the secure web site for unclassified data and to request transmittal of classified documentation, potential offerors must contact the Contract Specialist, Jessica Norris at jessica.d.norris@navy.mil, with the following information: Company name, mailing address, mailing address for classified information, phone number, e-mail address, current CAGE number, DoD System for Award Management (SAM) number and acknowledgement of the Contractor's responsibility under the U.S. export control laws and regulations. Please copy Mark Krukar at mark.krukar@navy.mil when e-mailing. Potential offerors shall acknowledge that no dissemination of any export-controlled technical data subject to this requirement will occur in a manner that would violate applicable export control laws and regulations via DD Form 2345, Militarily Critical Technical Agreements. Upon review of written request, verification of Offeror's status and acknowledgement of the Offeror's responsibility under the U.S. Export laws and regulations, web site access instructions (https://www site address, user name, and password) will be provided. Potential offerors will need a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) external certificate to access the unclassified technical library.</p>
<p>Potential offerors must also meet the requirements of the DD Form 254, Contract Security Classification Specification. In addition, the program requires a procurement effort in certain critical technologies/data that are not releasable to foreign firms. Some documents are under Federal export control for "sensitive" or "controlled" technologies regulated by the U.S. Department of State International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) protecting national security. Data may not be exported without an approval, authorization, or license under E.O. 12470 or the Arms Export Control Act.</p>
<p>The Offeror must be a U.S. Contractor, licensed, chartered, or incorporated in the U.S. The Offeror must have a valid Top Secret Facility Clearance Level (FCL) issued by the Defense Security Services (DSS), and be able to achieve and maintain designated contract secure work area(s) and personnel security/enhanced security access requirements. The Offeror must have the authority to receive critical technology and/or data required to execute this program. It is the Offeror's responsibility to provide evidence of any such agreement and/or license to this office for review and this shall be verified prior to release of any controlled documents.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this effort may contain information at the enhanced security classification level. For instructions and procedures on how to obtain this information, please contact the PMA-274 Security Manager, Chris Brugman at (301) 995-2808 or chris.brugman1@navy.mil.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Solicitation Conference:<br /></strong>The VXX Program intends to conduct a Pre-solicitation Conference the week of 10 December 2012 at Patuxent River, MD. The purpose of this event is to provide a status update of the VXX Program, inform industry of program requirements, discuss the competition timeline, receive industry's feedback on the draft RFP, and provide a Question &amp; Answer/networking opportunity.

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports.

<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006.

<DESC>This is a combined Synopsis/Solicitation/Notice of Intent for commercial items prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; quotations are not being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued for the solicitation number NIAID-NOI-13C-1610531 a Notice of Intent. The incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular FAC 2005-62 dated November 20, 2012. This acquisition will be processed under Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) and is not a small business set-aside. The associated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) Code is 325414, which has a business size standard of 500 employees. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) intends to procure a standing order for Britelite Plus on a sole source basis with PerkinElmer Health Sciences. Item/Description/Quantity: 1) Britelite Plus Reporter Gene Assay System, 1000 mL Kit, #6016769, qty-27 cases; (3 per shipment from date of award for 9 months). Britelite Plus is an ultra-sensitive luciferase reporter gene assay system for the quantitation of firefly luciferase expression in mammalian cells. This system is especially suitable for use in 96-, 384-, or 1536-well microplate formats, as in use in the high-throughput environment, because of the short half-life of the reagents. The Britelite Plus is compatible with the luminescence detection technology currently in place with the lab. This technology is used for the detection of other substrates in different applications, so replacing it with another product would be extremely costly and inefficient. Any attempts to change reagents for this particular application at this point would provide results inconsistent with previously gathered data. In addition, the relevance of various projects would be harmed because of the incompatibility of new data with data from previous trial runs; comparison would prove impossible with a change in reagents. The following factors shall be used to evaluate offers: 1) capability to meet required specifications, 2) price, and 3) delivery. Delivery shall be for 9 months from date of award to Gaithersburg, Maryland 20878. The government will award a fixed price purchase order to the responsible contractor.

<p>(h) Certification Regarding Responsibility Matters (Executive Order 12689). (Applies only if the contract value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold.) The offeror certifies, to the best of its knowledge and belief, that the offeror and/or any of its principals- <br />(1) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment, or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any Federal agency; <br />(2) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against them for: commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a Federal, state or local government contract or subcontract; violation of Federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; <br />(3) ( ) Are, ( ) are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly charged by a Government entity with, commission of any of these offenses enumerated in paragraph (h)(2) of this clause; and <br />(4) ( ) Have, ( ) have not, within a three-year period preceding this offer, been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains unsatisfied. <br />(i) Taxes are considered delinquent if both of the following criteria apply: <br />(A) The tax liability is finally determined. The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.</p>
<p><br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights. <br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment. <br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code). <br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted to:</p>

<a href="mailto:miranda.e.smith5.mil@mail.mil">ACC - Warren (ACC-WRN)(DTA)</a>
<DESC>The U.S. Army Contracting Command-Warren, (ACC-WRN) intends to issue a three year, sole source Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) task order contract to Hodges Transportation, Inc. DBA Nevada Automotive Test Center (NATC) of Carson City, NV. The proposed contract is to provide co-located fabrication, repair, maintenance, and storage of ballistic, blast, and automotive assets along with evaluation and analysis of ballistic, blast, and automotive evaluation events on assets being researched by the Tank Automotive Research Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) specifically in support of (ISO) the Occupant Centric Platform Technical Demonstrator (OCP TECD), the number one priority TECD program in the Army, and joint survivability efforts between the Army and the Marine Corps. <br>  less than p greater than NATC is the only source capable of timely providing the services required in a single location as a result of their unique facilities, test ranges, and automotive engineering test expertise. There is no known commercial or government site with the combination of evaluation environments, equipment, and instrumentation to simulate the mission profile and record vehicle capabilities that is required to meet the needs of this requirement. less than /p greater than  <br>  less than p greater than NATC's facilities are uniquely situated where the terrain profile covers elevation ranges from below sea level to 10,000 feet in altitude and represents 85% of the world surfaces. NATC is the only test site that provides the Army with access needed to vehicle test courses and ranges that were developed over naturally occurring terrain features with the severity and roughness which physically replicates the Army cross country and off-road mission profile in order to effectively test the operational capabilities of Army automotive assets. less than /p greater than  <br>  less than p greater than The Marine Corps uses NATC as their sole test center for their vehicle testing due to NATC's wide range of availability and capability. Contracting with NATC for this Army requirement allows for the needed standardization of the Army (TARDEC) and United States Marine Corps (USMC) mobility and survivability test operating procedures which will avoid future duplication of costs. To duplicate necessary range facilities and complete identical testing (100% comparable) by someone other than NATC would require substantial duplication of costs in order to modify/upgrade the test site, test equipment, and test operating procedures to meet the required range and testing capabilities for just the first task order, and much more so for the full effort anticipated. less than /p greater than  <br>  less than p greater than The testing required will utilize NATC's unique automotive and blast capabilities. The majority of evaluation asset fabrication will be from Developmental Technical Data Packages (Level II) which require expertise in fabricating for blast (e.g. welds, instrumentation mounting). Few companies have experience in this type of ballistic fabrication and only NATC can now timely provide co-location of necessary fabrication and necessary evaluation services for the planned contract. Having this co-location will allow the Government to avoid additional substantial duplication of costs. less than /p greater than  <br>  less than p greater than The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under the authority of FAR 6.302-1. This notice is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all responsible sources may submit a capability statement, or proposal, which shall be considered by the agency if timely received after publication of this synopsis. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract after considering responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. less than /p greater than  <br>  less than p greater than All inquiries on this action can be submitted in writing miranda.e.smith5.mil@mail.mil.
