<DESC>NA The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is soliciting proposals for scientific studies on biomechanical influences on bone, with the goal of preventing stress fractures in initial entry military training and optimizing bone health in young men and women that will protect them against bone diseases later in life.  This solicitation provides opportunities for the collection of pilot data to test novel hypotheses for which preliminary data may not be available. Studies sought include but are not li mited to: (1) the effect of resistance training on bone structure and function; (2) practical monitoring strategies to identify individuals at risk for stress fracture injury; (3) physiological interactions of bone and muscle turnover and stress fracture r isk; (4) effects of high intensity exercise on the bone remodeling process, and (5) interventions designed to optimize bone turnover favoring bone accretion in physically active populations.   Proposals will be evaluated for scientific merit distinguished by a clearly described plan and rationale, important and testable hypotheses, and evidence for the likelihood of successful completion and publication of results. Relevance to military problems  will be the ultimate determinant of funding. Proposals must provide a clear justification and military relevance but are not required to involve military volunteer subjects. Collaborations with DoD biomedical researchers are encouraged but not required. A  total of up to $2M for all awards is available for studies in this topic. Awards are expected to average $200K, including direct and indirect costs. Proposals should be submitted according to general instructions contained in the Broad Agency Announcement  (http://www.usamraa.army.mil).  Preproposals are not required; letters of intent containing a proposed title, brief description of project scope (lest than 150 words), and investigator and institution identification are due by 4 Sep 2002.  Full proposals are due no later than 4 pm, EST, 25 September 2002.

<DESC>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has a requirement for the procurement of 10 each Radio Sets, NSN 5820-01-417-6304, Motorola Model URC-200, part number 01-P36744M001. The proposed contract provides for support of the emergency Mobil Facilities Towers. The requirement for the radio sets was previously competed and the URC-200 were found to be the only radio that met the requirements of the FAA. The Mobil Facilities Towers are deployed to meet emergency or special event requirements, replace facilities destroyed by natural or man-made disasters, support scheduled maintenance and modernization programs and to establish temporary service at locations qualifying for facilities where lack of a facility would adversely affect flight safety. Currently the FAA Academy provides training to employees of the Mobil Facilities Towers in the use of the Motorola radio sets.  Therefore, the FAA must continue to use the Motorola radio sets to ensure standardization and compatib! ility for the Mobil Facilities Towers.  Competitive offers from authorized dealers of General Dynamics Decision Systems, formerly Motorola Integrated Information Systems Group, will be solicited. <P>

This procurement is being conducted under the Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP). NASA/MSFC intends to procure the items from Hile Controls of Alabama, 311 Applegate Parkway, Pelham, AL 35124 because Tescom is the known manuaturer (and Hile Controls of Alabama is the local distributor) of regulators that have a temperature rating of -40F before freezing.  Due to the high pressure ratio and the use of the regulators for combustion experiments, the -40F temperature capability is required for safety reasons. The Government intends to acquire a commercial item using FAR Part 12. Interested organizations may submit their capabilities and qualifications to perform the effort in writing to Kimberly R. Day not later than 4:30 p.m. local time.  Such capabilities/qualifications will be evaluated solely for the purpose of determining whether or not to conduct this procurement on a competitive basis.  A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed effort on a full and open competition basis, based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Oral communications are not acceptable in response to this notice. All responsible sources may submit an offer which shall be considered by the agency.

<DESC>The Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) Navigation Systems Program Office, PMA/PMW-156, has a requirement for GPS  antenna apertures that are compatible with installation and performance requirements (LO, aerodynamic drag , structural, vibration/acoustic, GPS reception/A/J etc.) of the F/A-18E/F and the GPS Antenna System 1 (GAS&#64979;1) Antenna Electronics (AE) in support of the Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR) program. The antenna must meet classified low radar cross section (Low Observable (LO)) requirements as well as additional requirements of being conformal and GPS III M-Code compliant. The projected procurement quantity for the targeted platforms is approximately 545 (plus 10% spares) production units over the life of the program (base year plus multiple option years). The initial quantity being required for delivery in Fiscal Year 04 (FY04) is approximately 7-10 units.  
The GAS-1 Antenna System consists of 2 Weapon Replaceable Assemblies (WRAs): the Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA), and the Antenna Electronics (AE). This Synopsis is for a conformal CRPA (C-CRPA) WRA only that interfaces with the GAS-1 AE (manufactured by Raytheon System Limited, Harlow UK). The goal of these antennas is to meet or exceed the performance requirements of the GAS-1 system with the additional requirements of being conformal, M-Code compliant and LO.    The antenna conformal design will be consistent with mounting on the aft top fuselage of the F/A-18E/F.  The antenna will need to conform to the contours of the aircraft surface to minimize performance impacts to F/A-18E/F requirements while meeting NAVWAR requirements. The government intends to procure a 7-element that will not exceed 7" in diameter.  
 Potential offerors will be required to provide representative ?bid samples? of the antenna at no cost to the Government for the purpose of laboratory testing to confirm GPS reception performance and A/J capability with the GAS-1 AE and establishing antenna RCS characteristics during the RFP phase.   The Navy intends on utilizing Boeing Corporation and Northrop-Grumman to assist in reviewing the responses received during the RFP phase. Proprietary or restricted information should be marked as such and will be protected.  Bid sample-testing will be conducted at Patuxent River NAS and at Boeing Corporation.  Offerors may be required to enter into Non Disclosure Agreements with Boeing and/or Northrop Grumman who may be involved in the source selection process.  A draft specification with a Request for Information announcement will be forthcoming in order for industry to provide comments.   This requirement is a full & open competition.

In the interest of acquisition streamlining, prospective sources are strongly encouraged to submit responses electronically to the Contracting Officer listed above.  The NAICS code for this action is 334511 and the FSC is 5826. All interested and responsible parties are encouraged to submit a request for the RFP in writing to: Contracts Competency , Bldg 441, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division, Patuxent River Maryland 20670-1127 Attn: Mary Carter

<DESC>The Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Coastal Systems Station, Panama City, Florida, intends to conduct a limited competition between Bell Avon, Inc. of Picayune, MS and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies, Inc. of Fenwick, WV to award a firm fixed price contract to manufacture an LCAC Deep Skirt System Components.  This acquisition is unsuitable for full and open competition for the following reasons. The Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) has conducted a qualification program for manufacturers fabricating LCAC flexible skirt systems. These manufacturers were qualified in accordance with Government document No. 802-6336529, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND REQUIREMENTS DATED 01 APRIL, 1996, Revision C and document No. 802-6336530, LANDING CRAFT, AIR CUSHION, PROJECT PECULIAR DOCUMENT, SKIRT FABRICATION PROCEDURES  dated 01 April, 1996, Revision B.  To date only Bell Avon, Inc. and B/E Aerospace-SMR Technologies have been certified as capable of providing the required LCAC flexible skirt systems.  As such these are the only two firms capable of competing for this requirement.  Use of any other vendor would result in substantial duplication of cost to the Government that is not expected to be recovered through competition.

<DESC>NAICS Code: 541990   The U.S. EPA intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with the University of Ky for a Report on High Capacity Sorbent Development for Mercury Capture under the authority of FAR Part 6.302-1.  This requirement for the ORD/NRMRL/STD includes development of novel high capacity sorbents for mercury capture from vapor and acqueous phase using inorganic/polymeric matrix functionalized with polyfunctional ligands and which have a highly significant impact on the reduction of mercury discharge on the environment.  This acquisition requires a contractor which has  proven accomplishments on the development of high capacity sorbents for toxic metals and has experimental facilities to develop and test the sorbents as well as the capability of system evaluation and materials analysis and characterization of the sorbents.  The U.S. EPA believes that only the  University of Ky Department of Chemical Engineering and Department of Chemistry is uniquely qualified to meet this requirement as it has developed high capacity sorbents (involving various polyamino actids) technologies for the capture of toxic metals from acqueous systems.  THIS NOTICE IS NOT A  REQUEST FOR QUOTATIONS.  However, any firm believing itself capable of meeting this EPA requirement  may submit technical documentation to establish its assertion.  The documentation must be submitted to the POC within 15 days of the electronic posting of this notice.  A determination not to  compete the proposed requirement based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the EPA.  Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement or to proceed on a sole source basis.

<DESC>Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), operated by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, solicits interest from companies interested in obtaining license rights to commercialize, manufacture and market the following technology.   License rights may be issued on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis and may include specific fields of use.  PNNL may also be available to licensee(s) to assist in further research and development of the technology under a sponsored research agreement or CRADA program.

THE TECHNOLOGY:  This technology is a proposed new technology for the high purity separation of enantiomers from a racemic mixture.  The process is quite different from methods currently used and has some practical advantages such as robustness and the relative ease of scaling up production.  The method has been experimentally shown to be highly effective for related types of separations.  PNNL now proposes to further develop the  method for enantiomeric separations.  We believe that when developed, the methodology will be capable of being scaled to gram and kilogram per day capacities, and will cost approximately $100 to $1,000 per gram of racemic material separated.  Preliminary calculations support the validity of the method envisioned.  PNNL seeks qualified commercial partners to financially support this development effort in partial exchange for licensing rights.


NOTE:   THIS IS NOT A PROCUREMENT.   Any company interested in licensing this technology must respond with a letter of interest (may be submitted by e-mail) no later than 30 days from the publication date of this Notice summarizing the company?s business and technical expertise and motivation for pursuing this opportunity.   Companies deemed appropriate will be provided with further information on the technology.  Such information may require an executed Nondisclosure Agreement.  Respondents wishing to enter into negotiations for a commercial license will be required to submit a business plan for the commercialization of the technology prior to licensee(s) selection and negotiations.  Please send letters of interest to the attention of the POC identified within this Notice.

The application is written in Wang Cobol and runs on an Unix platform.  Special programs are required to convert Wang Cobol to AcuCobol to allow the application to run on an Unix Platform.

<DESC>The Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization (DITCO) contracts for long haul telecommunications services with regulated and  non-regulated service providers and US International Carriers (USICs) on  behalf of the Department of Defense and various other Federal agencies for  lease of telecommunications services and ancillary equipment at locations  within the 48 Contiguous United States (CONUS), Hawaii, Alaska, US  Territories and Possessions, and international locations.   Telecommunications requirements are received daily by DITCO and  solicitations are posted to the DISA Contracting Opportunities web site.   Requirements processed by DITCO normally include a wide spectrum of  long-haul telecommunications services such as:  business lines and dial  tone services, local area access, Intrastate and Interstate point-to-point  services, switched services, domestic and international long distance  services, 800 Services, Frame Relay Services, Asynchronous Transfer Mode  (ATM) services, Packet Switched Data Services, video services, Integrated  Switched Digital Network (ISDN) services.  Analog services are typically  3-Khz voice grade circuits, while digital services range from 9.6 KBS  (narrowband) to OC-N (wideband) circuits.  The capability to browse all  "Inquiries" (solicitations) currently posted on the DISA Contracting  Opportunities web site is available to all companies without the need to  register in the DITCO system.  The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the  Contracting Opportunities Web Site is https://www.ditco.disa.mil/dcop.   If you plan on submitting a quote to any solicitation, you must first  register on the DISA Contracting Opportunities Web Site to obtain a User  ID and Password execute a basic agreement with DITCO.  Basic Agreements,  and instructions for executing Basic Agreements, can be obtained via the  Contracting Opportunities Home Page under the Publications link. DITCO  attempts to acquire all components for each telecommunications service  requirement from a single source.  DITCO utilizes a streamlined  "Inquiry/Quote/Order" (IQO) process to solicit contractor quotes and issue  "Orders" for required telecommunications services and equipment. Under the  IQO process, DITCO provides an "Inquiry" inviting companies to submit  quotations for delivery of specified telecommunications requirements.  The  "Inquiry" contains the technical information necessary to describe the  Government's requirement, along with the requested service date, and  solicits quotes from industry.  The "Quote" confirms the company's ability  to provide the requested service and equipment, identifies the time  interval in which the service and equipment can be provided, and provides  the applicable charges and Uniform Service Order Codes (USOCs).  After  evaluation of the "Quotes", an "Order" is prepared and issued to the  company whose "Quote" best conforms to the requirements of the Inquiry.   The "Order" forms the contract which is referred to as a Communications  Service Authorization (CSA).  Each CSA includes details about the  telecommunications services/equipment being acquired and also incorporates  contract terms and conditions prescribed by the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR), Department of Defense FAR Supplement (DFARS), and agency  regulations. To expedite the acquisition process, a basic agreement, which  includes general contract terms and conditions, is negotiated between  DITCO and the company.  This basic agreement is referenced in each  order/CSA issued to the company and incorporates the general contract  terms and conditions previously negotiated.  Additional specialized terms  and conditions may be incorporated into a CSA as required to satisfy  unique needs.  The normal practice is to allow companies to provide their  "Quote" within 14 business days from the date a requirement is posted on  the web.  However, for critical National Security requirements, a shorter  interval may be required. In situations where it is determined and  justified that only one company can satisfy a particular requirement,  DITCO may issue a non-competitive Inquiry or Direct Order to that company.   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for these  telecommunications services requirements is 513310.

This project is being accomplished for the United States Department of State in Charleston, South Carolina, with the end user being the Bureau of Financial Management (FMP).  The purpose of the project is to complete the worldwide consolidation of FMP in Charleston, SC.  The construction schedule will be compressed and is critical in order to meet the Department of State consolidation timeline.  FMP currently occupies Buildings A (646) and B (646A) at the former Naval Base Complex, Charleston, SC.  This project includes the construction of Building C, a new 92,000 square foot Administration Building, and a new 1,500 square foot three-story connector structure between Building C and Building B.  The existing Building C will be demolished under a separate contract.  The new facility will be a three-story structure on a pile supported foundation and will include a cafeteria, fitness center, auditorium, and maintenance shop area.  The office area is comprised of private offices and open office area.  All furnishings, both freestanding and modular systems, are included in the contract.  This contract also includes some minor renovation work in the existing Buildings A and B.  The estimated cost of construction is more than $10,000,000.  Proposals will be evaluated using two-phase source selection procedures that will result in award of a firm-fixed price contract to the responsible proposer whose proposal, conforming to the solicitation, is the ?best value? to the Government, price and technical factors considered.

FIRMS SUBMITTING TECHNICAL AND PRICE PROPOSALS WILL NOT BE COMPENSATED.  The Government reserves the right to reject any or all proposals at any time prior to award, to negotiate with any or all proposers; use of tradeoff process when it may be in the best interest of the Government to consider award to other than the lowest priced proposer or other than the highest technically rated proposer; and to award to the proposer submitting the proposal determined by the Government to be the most advantageous (Best Value) to the Government.  During Phase II of the process, PROPOSERS ARE ADVISED THAT THE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO EVALUATE PROPOSALS AND AWARD WITHOUT DISCUSSIONS OR ANY CONTACT CONCERNING THE PROPOSALS RECEIVED. Therefore, proposals should be submitted initially on the most FAVORABLE terms.  Proposers should not assume they would be contacted or afforded an opportunity to qualify, discuss, or revise their proposals.  The Government intends to issue Phase I on the WEB only.  Phase I will be issued on or about 10 July 2002 with proposals due approximately 30 days thereafter.   Phase II will be issued at a later date.  Participants in Phase II will be notified via email.

<DESC>Furnish all labor, supervision, equipment, tools, materials, operations and all associated work required to perform Firm-Fixed Price Structural Repairs to Pier 4, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, WA in accordance with contract specifications, which include, but are not limited to: 
Epoxy injection of cracks, repair of spalls and delaminations, underwater concrete repair, structurally upgrading the load capacity on the approach section, polyurethane injection of construction joints between Bents 24 to 37, repair of an expansion joint, and replacement of the catwalks and ladders of Pier 4.  The repairs also include performing bond capacity tests on the repair and upgrade materials and other incidental related work.
The primary goal of this project is to extend the useful life of the pier.  This is achieved by filling existing cracks, repairing deteriorated concrete, and replacing corroded reinforcing steel.  Piling and cylinders will also be repaired with specialty underwater materials and methods.
The estimated duration of the project is 20 months.  It is anticipated that the Contractor will be required to work around ongoing operations occurring both on the deck and alongside the pier, requiring a substantial coordination effort between the Contractor and the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS) during the project. The Contractor will be required to remove all equipment and materials that may interfere with PSNS operations upon a 48-hour notice.
The contract is broken into four phases to control the project quantities and schedule.   Phase A is all work to the 1933 approach section, including repairs, upgrades, and replacements above mean higher high water (MHHW).  Phase B is the 1914 pier section above MHHW, and Phase C is the 1923 pier section above MHHW.  Underwater (below MHHW) work is lumped into Phase D.  Phase D is an overlapping phase to occur sometime during the project.  This phase must remain flexible to comply with the work restrictions imposed by the Hydraulic Projects Approval (HPA) permit.

The NAICS Code is 234990 with a size standard of $17 Million. This solicitation is open to all business concerns. This acquisition will be competed under Source Selection procurement procedures in accordance with FAR Subpart 15.3. The contract resulting from this solicitation will be awarded to that responsible offeror whose offer, conforming to the solicitation, is determined to be the most advantageous to the Government price and technical factors considered. The combined technical factors  are approximately equal to price. The entire solicitation will be released solely on the Internet by Electronic Solicitation at http://esol.navfac.navy.mil (paper copies will not be available).

B--Jordan:  Airspace Modernization Plan Feasibility Study 

POC Evangela Kunene, USTDA, 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131, Tel: (703) 875-4357, Fax: (703) 875-4009.  Jordan:  Airspace Modernization Plan Feasibility Study.  The Grantee invites submission of qualifications and proposal data (collectively referred to as the "Proposal") from interested U.S. firms which are qualified on the basis of experience and capability to develop a feasibility study for an airspace modernization plan for the country of Jordan.

Because of its location, Jordan receives a fairly substantial volume of overflights crossing the Middle East region traveling to Europe, the Persian Gulf, Africa, the Indian Ocean, and Asia.  Modernizing Jordan's existing airspace system to better track these overflights would improve Jordan's position with respect to neighboring countries as a regional air navigation and safety hub.  It would also greatly enhance the planned liberalization and privatization of the country's civil aviation sector by allowing the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to become an independent and self-sustaining entity through improved collection of overflight fees.

The existing regional airspace is largely uncoordinated and employs widely varying technology systems operating independently in Syria, Lebanon, Israel-Mediterranean, and northern Saudi Arabia.  A modernized Communications Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) system in Jordan is critical for the establishment of an integrated and efficient Middle East regional airspace system, which the region currently lacks.  Additionally, such a system will help to ensure harmonization and coordination of the entire Middle East Airspace Corridor.  Furthermore, the CNS/ATM project fits into Jordan's goal of becoming a major IT, tourism, and service hub for the Middle East.

The objective of this study is to assist the CAA in developing an airspace modernization plan.  The study tasks are summarized as follows:  1) pre-planning and system assessments, 2) initial operational evaluation of the current Jordanian airspace system, 3) develop initial framework for a Jordanian airspace modernization plan, 4) recommendations for improvements to Jordanian airports/terminal areas for safety, efficiency and quality of service, 5) recommendations for improvements to Amman flight information region (FIR) air route structure for safety, efficiency and quality of service, 6) identification of needed CNS/ATM enhancement to support airspace operational improvements, 7) strategy development to improve efficiency and safety of joint use airspace and special use airspace (SUA) operations, 8) assessment of operation staffing, systems capacity and human resource issues, 9) environmental overview, 10) development of funding options, and 11) development of a final Jordan airspace modernization plan. 

The U.S. firm selected will be paid in U.S. dollars from a $350,020 grant to the Grantee from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA).
 
A detailed Request for Proposals (RFP), which includes requirements for the Proposal, the Terms of Reference, and a background desk study report are available from TDA, at 1621 N. Kent Street, Suite 200, Arlington, VA 22209-2131.  Requests for the RFP should be faxed to the IRC, TDA at 703-875-4009.  In the fax, please include your firm's name, contact person, address, and telephone number.  Some firms have found that RFP materials sent by U.S. mail do not reach them in time for preparation of an adequate response.  Firms that want TDA to use an overnight delivery service should include the name of the delivery service and your firm's account number in the request for the RFP.  Firms that want to send a courier to TDA to retrieve the RFP should allow one hour after faxing the request to TDA before scheduling a pick-up. Please note that no telephone requests for the RFP will be honored.  Please check your internal fax verification receipt.  Because of the large number of RFP requests, TDA cannot respond to requests for fax verification.  Requests for RFPs received before 4:00 PM will be mailed the same day.  Requests received after 4:00 PM will be mailed the following day.  Please check with your courier and/or mailroom before calling TDA.

Only U.S. firms and individuals may bid on this TDA financed activity.  Interested firms, their subcontractors and employees of all participants must qualify under TDA's nationality requirements as of the due date for submission of qualifications and proposals and, if selected to carry out the TDA-financed activity, must continue to meet such requirements throughout the duration of the TDA-financed activity.  All goods and services to be provided by the selected firm shall have their nationality, source and origin in the U.S. or host country.  The U.S. firm may use subcontractors from the host country for up to 20 percent of the TDA grant amount.  Details of TDA's nationality requirements and mandatory contract clauses are also included in the RFP.  

Interested U.S. firms should submit their Proposal in English directly to the Grantee by 4:00 P.M., Monday, July 1, 2002 at the above address.  Evaluation criteria for the Proposal are included in the RFP.  Price will not be a factor in contractor selection, and therefore, cost proposals should NOT be submitted.  The Grantee reserves the right to reject any and/or all Proposals.  The Grantee also reserves the right to contract with the selected firm for subsequent work related to the project.  The Grantee is not bound to pay for any costs associated with the preparation and submission of Proposals.

<DESC>GEMS Potential Sources Sought/Request for Information - This is not a solicitation, but rather a combined Request for Information and Industry Day announcement for the Ground Element Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) System (GEMS) acquisition strategy planning/market research phase.  The United States Air Force, Electronic Systems Center (ESC), Strategic and Nuclear Deterrence Command and Control (SND C2) Systems Program Office is seeking inputs from potential sources relative to development, production, and fielding of GEMS in the FY04 through FY09 time frame.  GEMS will replace Air Combat Command (ACC) and Air Mobility Command (AMC) fixed and deployable communications elements for bomber, tanker, reconnaissance, and other alert communications facilities supporting both inter-site and intra-site strategic C3 requirements.  GEMS will replace both mobile Single Channel Anti-Jam Man Portable (SCAMP) terminals and Fixed Site SCAMP (FSS) terminals to provide Extremely High Frequency (EHF)/Advanced EHF (AEHF) survivable/protected inter-site communications for disseminating and receiving Emergency Action Messages (EAMs), and will also provide a second, secure Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency (VLF/LF) communications path.  Additionally, GEMS will replace the Aircrew Alerting Communication Electromagnetic Pulse System/Electromagnetic Hardened Dispersal Communications (AACE/EHDC) for Ultra High Frequency Line-of-Sight (UHF LOS) intra-site Wing Command Post strategic C3 requirements.  GEMS implementation will start with the fixed sites, low data rate EHF, and UHF LOS aircrew alerting.  It then will become a mix of fixed and transportable site equipment according to system priority need. AEHF capability will be added toward the end of the procurement to take advantage of upgrades planned for other EHF terminals.  To be considered qualified for this effort, potential sources must demonstrate detailed knowledge and experience in the following areas: (1) understanding of nuclear C3 systems; (2) command post operations for command and control of nuclear weapons in accordance with EAP-CJCS Vols. I, II, V, and VII; (3) EAM dissemination communications systems; (4) integration of multiple communications systems for control by a single operator; (5) implementation of information system security IAW DOD S5200.16, DODD 5200.28, and CJCSI 3231.01; (6) nuclear effects hardening of equipment; (7) demonstrated ability to conduct system-level communications testing; (8) demonstrated ability to provide necessary program management and planning; and (9) access to TOP SECRET/SIOP-ESI facilities and availability of TOP SECRET/SIOP-ESI cleared personnel as required to work on this project.  An open session Industry Day will be held at Hanscom AFB, MA, on August 6, 2002 to further discuss GEMS requirements and solicit industry feedback for acquisition strategy development.  Private discussion sessions will be conducted with all interested parties August 7-8, 2002.

<SUBJECT>A -- Human Embryology Digital Library and Collaboratory Support Tools
<DESC>The National Library of Medicine intends to negotiate on a sole source basis with George Mason University, 4400 University Drive, Fairfax, VA  22030 under the authority of FAR 6.302.  George Mason University was awarded a contract (N01-LM-0-3507) with three successive options periods on November 16, 1999 to develop the Human Embryology Digital Library and Collaboratory Support Tools.  The project has succeeded in creating a large imaging archive and retrieval system, developing a collaborative annotation work environment, implementing an imaging workstation, and integrating the various hardware and software components into a prototype national network.  While a prototype distributed network for collaborative embryo imaging, annotation, and archiving has been developed and its application for education and clinical practice have been demonstrated, the project has been unable to complete the quantity of images expected due to unforeseen research problems related to making the individual components of the system interoperable and fully operational.  Moreover, additional work is needed to make the system fully useful to the research and education community.   Specifically, additional work will: 1) increase the number of embryos in the database as well as the number that are fully annotated, 2) add to the collection of embryo development animations, 3) involve a clinical study using trans-vaginal ultrasound along with Carnegie Collection embryo images for a study of first trimester pregnancies as well as adding ultrasound images to the collection, 4) enhance collaborative annotation software for synchronous mark up and improved access to the image repository, 5) maintain the growing digital library repository and adapt software to include 3D visualizations, 6) continue system engineering and management of the integrated technology suite, and begin investigation of critical issues in system security for future scaling to the broader medical community, and 7) provide existing and new collaborators with network, conferencing, distributed education, and collaboration support.  Because the research team and cooperative arrangements between the institutions performing the current work are already in place, introducing a new contractor, who would have to redevelop the programs and technologies now in place, would add materially to time and cost. This notice of intent, therefore, is not a request for proposals.  However, all responsible sources may submit a proposal which will be considered by the National Library of Medicine.  See numbered note 22.
