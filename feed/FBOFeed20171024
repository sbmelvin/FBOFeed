This acquisition involves technology that has a military or space application. The extent of foreign participation has not yet been determined. Nothing in this notice contradicts other restrictions, identified in the synopsis notice or solicitation regarding eligible sources (e.g. if this is a small business set aside foreign sources may not participate as prime contractors but could, if otherwise eligible, participate as subcontractors).
Based upon market research, the Government is not using the policies contained in FAR Part 12 (acquisitions of commercial items) in its solicitation for the described supplies. However, interested persons may identify to the contracting officer their interest and capability to satisfy the Government's requirement with a commercial item within 15 days of this notice.
The Government's obligation under this contract is contingent upon the availability of appropriated funds from which payment for contract purposes can be made. No legal liability on the part of the Government for any payment may arise until funds are made available to the contracting officer for this contract and until the contractor receives notice of such availability, to be confirmed in writing by the contracting officer.
This notice of intent is not a request for competition. However, all proposals received within 60 days (30 days if the award is issued under an existing basic ordering agreement) after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the Government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the Government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. It is suggested that small business firms or others interested in subcontracting opportunities in connection with the described procurement make contact with the firm(s) listed.

An Ombudsman has been appointed to hear concerns from offerors or potential offerors during the proposal development phase of this acquisition. The purpose of the ombudsman is not to diminish the authority of the program director or contracting officer, but to communicate contractor concerns, issues, disagreements, and recommendations to the appropriate government personnel.

Once registered, interested parties may enter offers during any "Open Period".</p>
<p>The Open Period for November 2017 is November 1, 2017 through November 7th, 2017, ending at 11:59 PM EST. Refer to AAAP RLP paragraph 3.02.A for more details on the offer submission process. The Government reserves the right to allow for multiple Open Periods prior to selecting an offer for award to meet this specific space requirement.  Offers cannot be submitted during the Closed Period (8th through the end of each month) and will not be considered for projects executed during that time period.</p>
<p>This FBO advertisement is hereby incorporated into the RLP 18-REG04 by way of reference as an RLP attachment.</p>

<p>* If you have previously submitted an offer in FY 2017, the AAAP application has a copy feature which will allow existing offers to be copied over to the FY 2018 RLP in order to avoid having to re-enter all of the data manually. Please be sure to review FY18 AAAP RLP Package and  each page within the AAAP Application prior to submitting your offer as some of the questions have changed. You must re-enter your space and rates on the &lsquo;Space and Rates' tab in the AAAP. Your previous offered space will not be copied.</p>

<DESC>Request for Information (RFI): Waterproof/Breathable Fabric and Membrane Technologies.
<p>The Program Executive Office, Soldier (PEO Soldier) and the Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) are seeking information on waterproof/breathable fabrics and/or membranes that may be used in Soldier footwear, environmental protection, or clothing items which provide improved moisture management, thermal regulation, and comfort over currently used materials. This request for information (RFI) is issued solely for information gathering and planning purposes. This RFI does not constitute a formal solicitation for proposals. The following sections of this announcement contain details of the scope of technical efforts of interest, along with instructions for the submission of responses.</p>
<p>1.0 Background &amp; Scope:<br />PEO-Soldier is responsible for the procurement and fielding of material solutions for the individual Soldier and Squad within the US Army. NSRDEC is the US Army's center for the development and evaluation of new technologies that may benefit the Soldier and Squad. Together these organizations are responsible for the identification of emerging technologies that can be integrated into fielded or field-able items that may benefit the Soldier.</p>
<p>&bull; The Army currently utilizes expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) as the waterproofing layer in the cold/wet weather footwear and clothing systems.</p>
<p>&bull; Footwear: the waterproof lining is currently a 3-layer laminate material consisting of a textile face fabric laminated to one side of a waterproof film (ePTFE, microporous), and a tricot knit cloth (nylon, 1.0 ounces per square yard) laminated to the opposite side of the waterproof film. Performance requirements for waterproof lining materials used in footwear as well as footwear end item testing can be found in Attachment 1 - Footwear Material Attribute Requirements and Test Methods.</p>
<p>&bull; Shell Material: The basic shell material for the cold/wet weather jacket and trouser is a waterproof and moisture vapor permeable, laminated cloth. The current base material utilizes a 100 percent nylon, ripstop fabric for the face fabric and the body facing material is ePTFE. Performance requirements for waterproof lining materials used in cold/wet weather clothing items as well as end item testing can be found in Attachment 2 - Basic Shell Material Requirements and Test Methods.</p>
<p>&bull; It is the intent of this RFI to capitalize on the technical advances in industry for durable, more breathable fabrics with greater moisture management capabilities that can be incorporated into Soldier footwear and clothing for use in deployment and training for the US Army.</p>
<p>&bull; The Army is looking for waterproofing technologies that are durable, breathable, washable, and capable of moving moisture away from the Soldier's body. Technologies with performance properties equivalent to or better than the currently used membranes (Attachments 1 and 2) are desired, but other proposed materials are welcome. Proposed materials must be durable across the spectrum of military operating and training environments, be capable of being made and used in footwear and environmental protective clothing and demonstrate performance improvements beyond the current materials based on the Test Procedures in Attachments 1 and 2.</p>
<p>&bull; PEO Soldier &amp; NSRDEC request that respondents submit materials related to this topic. The submissions may be used by the Government in formulating a program to assess the performance of the submitted materials and design concepts for functionality. It is requested that material submittals be accompanied by relevant performance and cost data as available given the short duration of this RFI. This announcement contains all of the information required to submit a response. No additional forms, kits, or other materials are needed.</p>
<p>&bull; PEO Soldier &amp; NSRDEC appreciates responses from all capable and qualified sources located within the US.<br />Responses must have the following:</p>
<p>1. A one page cover sheet that identifies the title, organization(s), respondent's technical and administrative points of contact - including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses of all co-authors, and clearly indicating its association with this RFI.<br />2. A substantive, focused, one-half page information paper that describes the materials being submitted or developed and a summary of the technical approaches taken to meet the intent of this RFI.<br />3. Production capability of 20,000 yards and production schedule.<br />4. Estimated cost per linear yard and unit end item cost.<br />5. Test Data<br />A) Test data demonstrating the performance of the material being submitted as it compares to the technical requirements of this RFI in Attachments 1 and 2, if available.<br />B) If a novel fabric is being proposed that may meet the intent of this RFI but will not satisfy all of the requirements listed in Attachments 1 and 2, then please provide material test data as available so that a tradeoff analysis can be conducted. <br />6. One (1) linear yard of material in any color (if available).<br />7. A material description including composition, chemical characteristics, fabrication method, and documentation supporting compliance with the Berry Amendment (USC, Title 10, Section 2533a).</p>
<p>2.0 Additional Information:<br />1. All properly marked proprietary information will be appropriately handled.<br />2. Submitted material will not be returned. All samples will be degraded or destroyed during review.<br />3. Respondents may submit up to five (5) different fabric candidates, but should clearly identify the advantages/disadvantages of each of the competing products. <br />4. Samples that do not meet the attribute thresholds in Attachments 1 and/or 2 may still be considered and respondents should clearly identify any shortcomings and trade-offs.<br />5. Non-woven or other materials may be considered and respondents should clearly identify any shortcomings and discuss the trade-offs.</p>
<p>3.0 Submission Instructions to Respondents:<br />Responses to this RFI are due no later than Friday, 10 November 2017 at 1200EST. All submissions must be electronically submitted to jeffrey.m.dunn.civ@mail.mil. Do not send questions with proprietary content. No telephone inquiries will be accepted.</p>
<p>4.0 Disclaimer and Important Notes <br />This is an RFI issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. Respondents are advised that PEO Soldier &amp; NSRDEC are under no obligation to acknowledge receipt of the information received, or provide feedback to respondents with respect to any information submitted under this RFI.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Respondents are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI. PEO Soldier and NSRDEC will NOT provide reimbursement for costs incurred in responding to this RFI. It is the respondent's responsibility to ensure that the submitted material has been approved for public release by the information owner.</p>
<p>The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this RFI or to otherwise pay for the information solicited, nor is the Government obligated to issue a solicitation based on responses received. No proprietary or classified concepts or information should be included in the submittal. Input on technical aspects of the responses may be solicited by PEO Soldier/NSRDEC from non-Government consultants/experts who are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements.</p>

<div>A. Introduction</div>
<div>The Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) on the IT Schedule 70 contract vehicle that define software use rights and mutual obligations have not been updated in more than ten years.</div>
<div>In recent years, industry&rsquo;s software delivery models and the Federal Government&rsquo;s software needs have evolved. This proposed update to the Software SINs seeks to capture these changes and refine the mutual rights and obligations between Federal Government software buyers and software providers.</div>
<div>The proposed changes are:</div>
<div>&#9679; Redefinition of SIN 132-32 Term Software Licenses,</div>
<div>&#9679; Optional Rights under SIN 132-33 Perpetual Software Licenses,</div>
<div>&#9679; Replacement of SIN 132-34 Software Maintenance as a Service with Software Maintenance as a Product</div>
<div>&#9679; Utilization Limitations Under SINs 132-32, 132-33, 132-34</div>
<div>&#9679; Commercial Supplier Agreements (CSA&rsquo;s) are defined to include Enterprise User License Agreements (EULA&rsquo;s), Terms of Service Agreements (TOS&rsquo;s) and other licensing agreements.</div>
<div>PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS RFI HIGHLIGHTS THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO BOTH THE SOLICITATION AND THE CRITICAL INFORMATION ADDENDUM TO THE SOLICITATION AS THEY RELATE TO SOFTWARE ONLY.</div>
<div>RFI: Proposed changes to IT Schedule 70&rsquo;s Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) October 2017</div>
<div>3</div>
<div>B. Summary of Changes</div>
<div>1) Term Software Licenses (SIN 132-32)</div>
<div>As Software delivery models and Cloud software licensing has evolved, the distinction between &ldquo;Term&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; software products like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS), and Platform as a Service (PaaS) has become less distinct. Oftentimes, Cloud software products are licensed under traditional term license agreements creating an opportunity for confusion. In order to properly delineate &ldquo;Term&rdquo; licenses under SIN 132-32 and to keep those licenses distinct from any form of Cloud products available under SIN 132-40 (Cloud Computing Services), &ldquo;Term Software Licenses&rdquo; have been redefined so that they are only applicable to software that is provisioned and executed from the &ldquo;user&rsquo;s servers, computing end-points, or other designated computing devices where the user has the right to load or deploy software.&rdquo; Additionally, the requirement to convert term licenses into perpetual licenses has been modified so that it is only required when an Offeror offers the same conversions to their commercial customers.</div>
<div>2) Perpetual Software Licenses (SIN 132-33)</div>
<div>Recent requirements of the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA), The MEGABYTE Act, and the OMB Software Memo of June 2, 2016 (M-16-12) have required the Federal Government to begin to manage and treat software as a valued asset. The focus of these initiatives has been on the ability to inventory existing software assets and for Federal Government buyers to make informed decisions before conducting new software acquisitions.</div>
<div>This proposal does not change the definition of Perpetual Licenses. However, in order to support recent software asset management initiatives, this proposal creates two options that software vendors may volunteer to include with their perpetual licenses. Option 1 contemplates software vendors that will embed software identification tags in their software products that are consistent with the ISO/IEC 19970-2 standard. Option 2 contemplates software vendors that will allow incumbent software licensees a right to transfer or move perpetual licenses to a new licensee for a previously negotiated fee. It is intended that these new asset management rights and features are voluntary, meaning that software vendors who wish to offer them may optionally include them on their Schedule contract.</div>
<div>3) Software Maintenance as a Service (SIN 132-34)</div>
<div>The current Special Item Number - Software Maintenance as a Service (132-34) will be deleted and replaced by Software Maintenance as a Product using the same SIN (132-34). Software Maintenance as a Service shall no longer be an enumerated SIN and shall be</div>
<div>RFI: Proposed changes to IT Schedule 70&rsquo;s Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) October 2017</div>
<div>4</div>
<div>deleted and the services previously provided under Software Maintenance as a Service shall be provided under Information Technology Professional Services (132-51).</div>
<div>Currently, Software Maintenance as a Product does not have its own SIN. It is a non-enumerated embedded component of both Term Software Licenses and Perpetual Software Licenses. Software Maintenance as a Product, henceforth, will be the maintenance that software vendors charge for on an annual basis. Because Software Maintenance as a Product has not been previously identified with its own SIN and because it is a component of a Term License or Perpetual License acquisition, it has been difficult to track the Federal Government&rsquo;s actual spend on annual software maintenance. Under the current software maintenance SIN structures, it is impossible to differentiate a software purchase from an annual software maintenance purchase. Providing Software Maintenance as a Product with its own SIN identifier allows the Federal Government to better manage software as an asset and appropriately track categories of spend by differentiating between software licenses and software maintenance.</div>
<div>4. Utilization Limitations</div>
<div>GSA seeks to clarify the rights the Federal Government maintains when Derivative Works such as modifications, customizations or other enhancements are created to the licensed software. The ownership of such Derivative Works can be a cause of confusion sometimes requiring the government to pay additional fees to ensure uninterrupted usage despite the fact that the Federal Government paid for the creation of the Derivative Work. GSA clarifies its rights in Derivative Works by declaring that such works shall be owned by the owner of the underlying software, but the Federal Government shall have a right to use the Derivative Work without paying for a new usage right.</div>

<div>5</div>
<div>C) Proposed Changes to the IT Schedule 70 Solicitation pertaining to Software SINS 132-32, 132-33, 132-34</div>
<div>PLEASE NOTE: LANGUAGE THAT IS NOTED WITH STRIKETHROUGH ARE PROPOSED DELETIONS. LANGUAGE THAT IS IN [BOLD ITALICS AND BRACKETS] ARE THE PROPOSED ADDITIONS.</div>
<div>132 32 --- Term Software License - SUBJECT TO COOPERATIVE PURCHASING</div>
<div>Includes operating system software, application software, EDI translation and mapping software, enabled E-Mail message based products, Internet software, database management programs, and other software.</div>
<div>Software maintenance as a product includes the publishing of bug/defect fixes via patches and updates/upgrades in function and technology to maintain the operability and usability of the software product. It may also include other no charge support that is included in the purchase price of the product in the commercial marketplace. No charge support includes items such as user blogs, discussion forums, on-line help libraries and FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), hosted chat rooms, and limited telephone, email and/or web-based general technical support for user s self diagnostics.</div>
<div>Software maintenance as a product does NOT include the creation, design, implementation, integration, etc. of a software package. These examples are considered software maintenance as a service under SIN 132.34 Software Maintenance.</div>
<div>Software Maintenance as a product is billed at the time of purchase.</div>
<div>NOTE: The word "Term" is defined in this Solicitation as "a limited period of time".</div>
<div>[Term Software Licenses are distinct from Cloud (SIN 132-40). Unlike the Cloud SIN, Term software is installed and executed from the user&rsquo;s servers, computing end-points, or other designated computing devices where the user has the right to load and deploy software. This SIN is NOT Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), or Software as a Service (SaaS) as defined in the Cloud SIN 132-40. Term Software Licenses are distinct from Electronic Commerce and Subscription Services (SIN 132-52).</div>
<div>Term Software Licenses have a limited duration and are not owned in perpetuity. Unless Offerors provide an option for converting Term licenses into perpetual licenses, users lose the right to use these licenses upon the end of the term period.]</div>
<div>RFI: Proposed changes to IT Schedule 70&rsquo;s Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) October 2017</div>
<div>6</div>
<div>NOTE: The Transactional Data Reporting (TDR) Rule requires vendors to electronically report the price the federal government paid for an item or service purchased through GSA acquisition vehicles. The TDR PILOT APPLIES TO THIS SIN. If a TDR covered SIN(s) is included on a contract or offer with non-TDR SIN(s), then the entire contract is subject to TDR and the Price Reduction Clause (PRC) and Commercial Sales Practice (CSP) requirements are removed for the entire contract. However, the TDR clause does not exempt the contractor from existing reporting requirements found elsewhere in the contract.</div>
<div>NOTE: The word "Term" is defined in this Solicitation as "a limited period of time".</div>
<div>Please see the additional terms and conditions applicable to this Special Item Number (SIN) found in a separate attachment to the Solicitation. These terms and conditions do not contain specific and negotiated contractual language for this SIN. The Schedule contractor may have submitted additional information to complete the "fill-in" to the terms and conditions. The ordering activities shall request the Schedule contractors to submit these additional contract terms and conditions for this applicable SIN when responding to an order.</div>
<div>Ordering activities may request from Schedule contractors their awarded [Commercial Supplier Agreement (to include] End User License Agreements (EULAs) or Terms of Service (TOS) Agreements), which will assist the ordering activities with reviewing the terms and conditions and additional products and services and prices which, may be included.</div>

<div>Includes operating system software, application software, EDI translation and mapping software, enabled E-mail message based products, Internet software, database management programs, and other software.</div>
<div>Software maintenance as a product includes the publishing of bug/defect fixes via patches and updates/upgrades in function and technology to maintain the operability and usability of the software product. It may also include other no charge support that is included in the purchase price of the product in the commercial marketplace. No charge support includes items such as user blogs, discussion forums, on-line help libraries and FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), hosted chat rooms, and limited telephone, email and/or web-based general technical support for user s self diagnostics.</div>
<div>Software maintenance as a product does NOT include the creation, design, implementation, integration, etc. of a software package. These examples are considered software maintenance as a service under SIN 132.34 Software Maintenance as a Service.</div>
<div>Software Maintenance as a product is billed at the time of purchase.</div>
<div>NOTE: The Transactional Data Reporting (TDR) Rule requires vendors to electronically report the price the government paid for an item or service purchased through GSA acquisition vehicles. The TDR PILOT APPLIES TO THIS SIN. If a TDR covered SIN(s) is included on a contract or offer with non-TDR SIN(s), then the entire contract is subject to TDR and the Price Reduction Clause (PRC) and Commercial Sales Practice (CSP) requirements are removed for the entire contract. However, the TDR clause does not exempt the contractor from existing reporting requirements found elsewhere in the contract.</div>
<div>NOTE: The word "Perpetual" is defined in this Solicitation as "continuing forever, everlasting, valid for all time".</div>
<div>[Section 837 of The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) of 2015, requires GSA to seek agreements with software vendors that enhance government-wide acquisition, shared use, and dissemination of software, as well as compliance with end user license agreements. The Megabyte Act of 2016 requires agencies to inventory software assets and to make informed decisions prior to new software acquisitions. In June of 2016, the Office of Management and Budget issued guidance on software asset management requiring each CFO Act (Public Law 101-575 &ndash; 11/15/1990) agency to begin software inventory management (M-16-12). To support these requirements, Offerors may elect to include the terms of Option 1 and/or Option 2 below, which support software asset management and government-wide reallocation or transferability of perpetually licensed software.</div>
<div>RFI: Proposed changes to IT Schedule 70&rsquo;s Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) October 2017</div>
<div>9</div>
<div>OPTION 1</div>
<div>Software Asset Identification Tags (SWID)</div>
<div>Option 1 is applicable when the Offeror agrees to include the International Organization for Standardization/International Electrotechnical Commission 19770-2 (ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015) standard identification tag (SWID Tag) as an embedded element in the software. An ISO/IEC 19970-2 tag is a discoverable identification element in software that provides licensees enhanced asset visibility. Enhance visibility supports both the goals of better software asset management and license compliance. Offerors may use the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) document &ldquo;NISTIR 8060: Guidelines for Creation of Interoperable Software Identification (SWID) Tags,&rdquo; December 2015 to determine if they are in compliance with the ISO/IEC 19770-2 standard.</div>
<div>OPTION 2</div>
<div>Reallocation of Perpetual Software</div>
<div>Option 2 is applicable when the Offeror agrees to allow transferability or reuse of software, for authorized government users, who were not the original grantee of the license rights. Offerors may charge a pre-determined administrative fee for this right, at the time of transfer, as well as designate a process that ensures the transferable software assets may be moved without violating pre-existing licensing limitations or infringing intellectual property rights. Option 2 does not grant the Government a right to make or use unauthorized or illegal copies of software. It provides the Government a right, working with assistance of the licensor, to move perpetual software assets to Government entities that have a need, without the requirement to repurchase already owned Government assets.]</div>

<div>132 34 --- Maintenance of Software as a Service [Product]- SUBJECT TO COOPERATIVE PURCHASING</div>
<div>Software maintenance as a service creates, designs, implements, and/or integrates customized changes to software that solve one or more problems and is not included with the price of the software. Software maintenance as a service includes person-to-person communications regardless of the medium used to communicate: telephone support, on-line technical support, customized support, and/or technical expertise which are charged commercially.</div>
<div>Software maintenance as a service is billed in arrears in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3324.</div>
<div>[Software Maintenance as a Product is the payment of standardized maintenance services provided by a software publisher or designated agent of the software publisher to maintain the operability and functionality of the software. These services are defined in a standardized commercial program and include items like bug/defect fixes via patches and updates/upgrades in functionality. It may also include access to items such as user blogs, discussion forums, on-line help libraries and FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions), hosted chat rooms, telephone support, email and/or web-based general technical support for user self diagnostics. Software vendors may offer multiple versions of standardized maintenance programs that enhance the benefits provided to include extended hours of service and/or other commitments to meet minimum service levels. Any form of support service that includes open-ended services that are billed in arrears is Information Technology Professional Services (SIN 132-51) not Software Maintenance as a Product.</div>
<div>Software Maintenance as a Product is billed at the time of software licensing and then again on a periodic or annual basis. Software Maintenance as a Product provides coverage of the relevant software licenses for a twelve-month period although longer or shorter periods may be acceptable. Software maintenance as a Product may be mandatory in the first year of licensing, but may be optional for renewal thereafter. When Software Maintenance as a Product is not renewed, the corresponding Software Maintenance as a Product lapses. Renewal fees in order to reinstate lapsed Software Maintenance as a Product are also considered payments for Software Maintenance as a Product. Offerors who allow for lapsed Software Maintenance as a Product to be renewed shall indicate the fee structure for such renewals.</div>
<div>Under no circumstances shall the cost of reinstating lapsed Software Maintenance as a Product exceed what the total cost of keeping the software under Maintenance would have cost, if the Software Maintenance as a Product had not lapsed. When the cost of reinstating lapsed Software Maintenance as a Product matches or exceeds the cost of issuing new software, the Offer shall provide the option to replace the lapsed software with new software.]</div>

<div>**The phrase, &ldquo;Term Licenses and/or Maintenance&rdquo; in the preceding paragraphs may need to be revised in order to be consistent with the Offeror&rsquo;s proposal; e.g., if only software maintenance is offered, all references to &ldquo;term licenses&rdquo; should be deleted from the preceding paragraphs.**</div>
<div>7. [6]. CONVERSION FROM TERM LICENSE TO PERPETUAL LICENSE</div>
<div>a. The ordering activity may convert term licenses to perpetual licenses for any or all software at any time following acceptance of software. At the request of the ordering activity the Contractor shall furnish, within ten (l0) calendar days, for each software product that is contemplated for conversion, the total amount of conversion credits which have accrued while the software was on a term license and the date of the last update or enhancement.

<div>b. Conversion credits which are provided shall, within the limits specified, continue to accrue from one contract period to the next, provided the software remains on a term license within the ordering activity. [When conversion credits are provided, they shall continue to accrue from one contract period to the next, provided the software has been continually licensed without interruption.]</div>
<div>c. The term license for each software product shall be discontinued on the day immediately preceding the effective date of conversion from a term license to a perpetual license.</div>
<div>d. [When conversion from term licenses to perpetual licenses is offered t]he price the ordering activity shall pay will be the perpetual license price that prevailed at the time such software was initially ordered under a term license, or the perpetual license price prevailing at the time of conversion from a term license to a perpetual license, whichever is the less, minus an amount equal to % of all term license payments during the period that the software was under a term license within the ordering activity.</div>
<div>8. [7]. TERM LICENSE CESSATION</div>
<div>a. After a</div>
<div>software product has been on a continuous term license for a period</div>
<div>of__________* months, a fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual license for the software product shall automatically accrue to the ordering activity. The period of continuous term license for automatic accrual of a fully paid-up perpetual license does not have to be achieved during a particular fiscal year; it is a written Contractor commitment which continues to be available for software that is initially ordered under this contract, until a fully paid-up perpetual license accrues to the ordering activity. However, should the term license of the software be discontinued before the specified period of the continuous term license has been satisfied, the perpetual license accrual shall be forfeited. [Contractors who do not commercially offer conversions of term licenses to perpetual licenses shall indicate that their term</div>
<div>RFI: Proposed changes to IT Schedule 70&rsquo;s Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) October 2017</div>
<div>17</div>
<div>licenses are not eligible for conversion at any time].</div>
<div>**Each separately priced software product shall be individually enumerated, if different accrual periods apply for the purpose of perpetual license attainment.**</div>
<div>b. The Contractor agrees to provide updates and maintenance[as a product] service for the software after a perpetual license has accrued, at the prices and terms of Special Item Number l32-34, if the licensee elects to order such services. Title to the software shall remain with the Contractor.</div>
<div>9. [8]. UTILIZATION LIMITATIONS - (SIN 132-32, SIN 132-33, AND SIN 132-34)</div>
<div>a. Software acquisition is limited to commercial computer software defined in FAR Part 2.101.</div>
<div>b. When acquired by the ordering activity, commercial computer software and related</div>
<div>documentation so legend shall be subject to the following:</div>
<div>(1) Title to and ownership of the software and documentation shall remain with the Contractor, unless otherwise specified.</div>
<div>(2) Software licenses are by site and by ordering activity. An ordering activity is defined as a cabinet level or independent ordering activity. The software may be used by any subdivision of the ordering activity (service, bureau, division, command, etc.) that has access to the site the software is placed at, even if the subdivision did not participate in the acquisition of the software. Further, the software may be used on a sharing basis where multiple agencies have joint projects that can be satisfied by the use of the software placed at one ordering activity's site. This would allow other agencies access to one ordering activity's database. For ordering activity public domain databases, user agencies and third parties may use the computer program to enter, retrieve, analyze and present data. The user ordering activity will take appropriate action by instruction, agreement, or otherwise, to protect the Contractor's proprietary property with any third parties that are permitted access to the computer programs and documentation in connection with the user ordering activity's permitted use of the computer programs and documentation. For purposes of this section, all such permitted third parties shall be deemed agents of the user ordering activity.</div>
<div>(3) Except as is provided in paragraph 9.b(2) [8.b(2)] above, the ordering activity shall not provide or otherwise make available the software or documentation, or any portion thereof, in any form, to any third party without the prior written approval of the Contractor. Third parties do not include prime Contractors, subcontractors and agents of the ordering activity who have the ordering activity's permission to use the licensed software and documentation at the facility, and who have agreed to use the licensed software and documentation only in accordance with these restrictions. This provision does not limit the right of the ordering activity to use software, documentation, or information therein, which the ordering activity may already have or obtains without restrictions.</div>
<div>(4) The ordering activity shall have the right to use the computer software and documentation with the computer for which it is acquired at any other facility to which that computer may be transferred, or in cases of Disaster Recovery, the ordering activity has the right to transfer the software to another site if the ordering activity site for which it is acquired is deemed to be unsafe for ordering activity personnel; to use the computer software and documentation with a backup computer when the primary computer is inoperative; to copy computer programs for safekeeping (archives) or backup purposes; to transfer a copy of the software to another site for purposes of benchmarking new hardware and/or software; and to modify the software and documentation or combine it with other software, provided that the unmodified portions shall remain subject to these restrictions.</div>
<div>(5) "Commercial Computer Software" may be marked with the Contractor's standard commercial restricted rights legend, but the schedule contract and schedule pricelist, including this clause, "Utilization Limitations" are the only governing terms and conditions, and shall take precedence and supersede any different or additional terms and conditions included in the</div>
<div>RFI: Proposed changes to IT Schedule 70&rsquo;s Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) October 2017</div>
<div>18</div>
<div>standard commercial legend.</div>
<div>[(6) Licensee Data belongs exclusively to Licensee, regardless of where the Data may reside at any moment in time including, but not limited to, Licensor hardware, networks or other infrastructure and facilities where Data may reside, transit through or be stored from time to time. Licensor makes no claim to a right of ownership in Licensee Data. Licensor agrees to keep the Licensee Data Confidential as that term is defined in the relevant FAR and DFARS provisions pertaining to Confidential Information and Confidentiality. Licensor is not permitted to use Licensee&rsquo;s data for a purpose that is not explicitly granted in writing by Licensee. Upon Licensee request, for any reason whatsoever, Licensor must promptly return all Licensee Data in Licensor&rsquo;s possession in a format as may be designated at the time of request by Licensee.</div>
<div>(7) Licensee might create or hire others (including Licensor) to create modifications, customizations or other enhancements to the Software which might be classified as &ldquo;Derivative Works&rdquo; of the software. The intellectual property (IP) rights to the Derivative Works shall be owned by the owner of the underlying intellectual property. The Derivative Work shall be made available to the Licensee through a royalty free, perpetual worldwide, no charge license to the Licensee.</div>
<div>(8) Reallocation of Perpetual Software (Option 2 SIN 132-33)</div>
<div>a. The purpose of SIN 132-33 OPTION 2 is to allow ordering activities to transfer software assets for a pre-negotiated charge to other ordering activities.</div>
<div>b. When an ordering activity becomes aware that a reusable software asset may be available for transfer, it shall contact the Contractor, identify the software license or licenses in question, and request that these licenses be reallocated or otherwise made available to the new ordering activity.</div>
<div>c. Contractors shall release the original ordering activity from all future obligations under the original license agreement and shall present the new ordering activity with an equivalent license agreement. When the new ordering activity agrees to the license terms, henceforth any subsequent infringement or breach of licensing obligations by the new ordering activity shall be a matter exclusively between the new ordering activity and the Contractor.</div>
<div>d. The original ordering activity shall de-install, and/or make unusable all of the software assets that are to be transferred. It shall have no continuing right to use the software and any usage shall be considered a breach of the Contractor&rsquo;s intellectual property and a matter of dispute between the original ordering activity/original license grantee and the licensor.</div>
<div>e. As a matter of convenience, once the original licenses are deactivated, di-installed, or made otherwise unusable by the original ordering activity or license grantee, the Contractor may elect to issue new licenses to the new ordering activity to replace the old licenses. When new licenses are not issued, the Contractor shall provide technical advice on how best to achieve the functional transfer of the software assets.</div>
<div>f. Software assets that are eligible for transfer that have lapsed Software Maintenance as a Product (SIN 132-34) may require a maintenance reinstatement fee, chargeable to the new ordering activity or license grantee. When such a fee is paid, the new ordering activity shall receive all the rights and benefits of Software Maintenance.</div>
<div>g. When software assets are eligible for transfer, and are fully covered under pre-paid Software Maintenance as a Product (SIN 132-34), the new ordering activity shall not be required to pay maintenance for those license assets prior to</div>

<div>the natural termination of the paid for maintenance period. The rights associated with paid for current Software Maintenance as a Product shall automatically transfer with the software licenses without fee. When the maintenance period expires, the new ordering activity or license grantee shall have the option to renew maintenance.</div>
<div>h. The administrative fee to support the transfer of licenses, exclusive of any new incremental licensing or maintenance costs shall be ______ % of the original license fee. The fee shall be paid only at the time of transfer. In applying the transfer fee, the Software Contractor shall provide transactional data that supports the original costs of the licenses.]</div>
<div>9. SOFTWARE CONVERSIONS - (SIN 132-32 AND SIN 132-33)</div>
<div>Full monetary credit will be allowed to the ordering activity when conversion from one version of the software to another is made as the result of a change in operating system, or from one computer system to another. Under a perpetual license (132-33), the purchase price of the new software shall be reduced by the amount that was paid to purchase the earlier version. Under a term license (132-32), [if] conversion credits [had] which accrued, while the earlier version was under a term license, [those credits] shall carry forward and remain available as conversion credits which may be applied towards the perpetual license price of the new version.</div>
<div>10. DESCRIPTIONS AND EQUIPMENT COMPATIBILITY</div>
<div>The Contractor shall include, in the schedule pricelist, a complete description of each software product and a list of [compatible operating systems] equipment on which the software can be used.

<div>The Contractor shall insert the discounted pricing for right-to-copy licenses.</div>
<div>RFI: Proposed changes to IT Schedule 70&rsquo;s Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) October 2017</div>
<div>20</div>
<div>G) Questions for Industry</div>
<div>GSA would like to obtain feedback from industry regarding the proposed draft changes to the Software SINs and supporting language. Our primary objective is to update the language to support the needs of the Federal Government while taking into account the commercial business practices and models of software vendors.</div>
<div>1. For Term Licenses, the new definition attempts to differentiate Cloud-based software delivery models from on-premise software that has a limited term of use. Is there anything in the proposed language that would confuse the difference between term licenses and cloud-based software delivery? Is there anything in the proposed language that creates a market barrier for a software provider? Are there Term License models that are not captured by either the Cloud SINs or the proposed definition of Term Licenses?</div>
<div>2. The goal for the Optional Realloction Rights (ability to transfer) under Perpetual Licenses is to facilitate the Federal Government&rsquo;s ability to manage software as an asset.</div>
<div>a) Under Option 1, Software Asset Identification Tags, is there anything in the proposed language that would impede the Federal Government&rsquo;s desire to collect software asset data? Is there any issue with associating the embedded standard to the ISO/IEC 19770 standard? Is there an alternative approach to embedding tags under this standard that are more efficient or effective?</div>
<div>b) Under Option 2, is there anything in the proposed language that would impede the Federal Government&rsquo;s desire to move previously acquired software assets to new users? Is the process as described in the Critical Information Addendum the appropriate and necessary steps required to support a software transfer? Is there an alternative approach to better assist the government in the movement of previously acquired software assets to future users?</div>
<div>3. For the proposed deletion of Software Maintenance as a Service and the proposed separate enumeration of Software Maintenance as a Product, is there anything in the proposed language that would impede the Federal Government&rsquo;s desire to better track the funds spent on standard software maintenance products? Is there any issue with rolling the &ldquo;payment in arrears&rdquo; services that had been provided under Software Maintenance as a Service into the general category of IT Professional Services under SIN 132-51?</div>
<div>RFI: Proposed changes to IT Schedule 70&rsquo;s Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) October 2017</div>
<div>21</div>
<div>4. For the proposed additional language addressing Derivative Works and intellectual property rights, GSA has proposed language that allows software licensees under IT Schedule 70 to have a right to use Derivative Works without a requirement for additional payment. Is there anything in the proposed language that would impede the Federal Government&rsquo;s desire to have uninterrupted access to Derivative Work? Is there anything in the proposed language that would create new barriers for the creation of Derivative Works by industry? Is there an alternative approach that is more efficient and effective than the proposed language?</div>
<div>H) Questions for Government Agencies</div>
<div>While the primary purpose of this RFI is to gather information from industry, GSA also welcomes feedback from Federal Government agencies about any aspect of the RFI. Industry partners do not need to respond to these questions.</div>
<div>1. Do Term Licenses under the proposed definition account for any significant software purchases for your agency? Under what circumstances do you purchase Term Licenses as defined in the proposed language instead of Cloud services or Perpetual Licenses?</div>
<div>2. Does your agency believe that adding software identification tags in Perpetual software licenses will aid the ability to correctly inventory your software assets? If there were an effective and efficient way to reallocate software from one agency to another would you be willing to accept the transfer of that software asset rather than to make a new purchase?</div>
<div>3. Can you effectively differentiate between the budget you spend on software maintenance from the budget you spend on new software? If so, how? Do you believe that the specific identification of a new SIN for Software Maintenance as a Product will bring better visibility to your IT spend?</div>
<div>4. Have you had issues with Derivative Works and the rights to continue to use customizations or other works where ownership and rights have been confusing? Have you developed an efficient way to manage these rights? Do you believe the language of the proposed Derivative Works provides enough protection for your software needs?</div>
<div>I) Deadline for Responses</div>
<div>Your response must be provided no later than Tuesday, November 14, 2017, 4pm EST.</div>
<div>Response packages should be sent by email to Sharon.aiken@gsa.gov. Please include a subject line of: IT Schedule 70 RFI Response re: Software SINs</div>
<div>RFI: Proposed changes to IT Schedule 70&rsquo;s Software Special Item Numbers (SINs) October 2017</div>
<div>22</div>

<DESC>This is a <strong>Request for Information (RFI)</strong> as defined in FAR 15.201(e). The Government is requesting information regarding the availability and feasibility of attracting potentially new service providers. This announcement constitutes a Request for Information (RFI) for the purpose of determining market capability of sources or obtaining information. It does not constitute a Request for Proposals (RFP), a Request for Quote (RFQ) or an indication that the Government will contract for any of the items and/or services discussed in this notice. Submission of a response to this RFI is entirely voluntary. The voluntary submission of a response to this RFI shall not obligate Department of Education - Federal Student Aid (FSA) to pay or entitle the submitter of information to claim any direct or indirect costs or charges or any other compensation whatsoever.
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><br />This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes and does not constitute a solicitation. All information received in response to this RFI will be treated as business confidential information, and exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Nonetheless, submitters should properly mark their responses if the information is confidential. Response to the RFI will not be returned. In accordance with FAR 15.201(e), responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the Government to form a binding contract. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this RFI.</p>
<p><br /><strong>A. Purpose</strong><br />The Federal Student Aid (FSA) is requesting information on potential service providers to develop, operate, and maintain a next-generation version of the Department of Education's user provisioning application, the Participation Management system (PM).</p>
<p>Note: Please refer to the attached Current State and High Level Requirements documents, which provide additional system description information.</p>
<p>The Department is seeking industry's input on both development time and high level cost associated with two potential development paths to meet the business needs identified below:</p>
<p>1. A completely new system using the best-available industry standard technologies;<br />2. A Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) product, customized by the vendor</p>
<p><strong>B. Background: <br /></strong>Participation Management (PM) is Federal Student Aid's (FSA) central system for managing enrollment in and access to FSA's electronic data exchange services. These electronic services include both batch download and online data exchange services used by FSA partner organizations in carrying out their administrative duties related to the delivery of financial aid to millions of college students. In addition to developing, operating, and maintaining the PM system itself, the PM contractor provides customer support services for mailroom receipt, data processing, and (when necessary) scanning of applications and their supporting documents required for the services enrollment process. The contractor also provides customer support for user enrollment problems.</p>
<p>The PM system interfaces closely with the systems that provide FSA's various data services and with the Student Aid Internet Gateway (SAIG) in order to provide those systems with data about who is enrolled in each electronic data service. An additional interface with FSA's Access and Identity Management System (AIMS) provides AIMS with necessary enrollment information for services that require users to authenticate when logging in over the web. PM currently manages over 21,000 new enrollments and 38,000 enrollment updates to these FSA data services annually.</p>
<p>At a high level, FSA's business needs for this system include the following:<br /><br />1. The system shall provide a public-facing interface for the capture and storage of user "access rights" requests.<br /><br />2. The system shall capture and store all imaged signature (approval) documents related to each "access rights" request.<br /><br />3. The system shall provide workflow capabilities to move "access rights" requests through various stages of approval, and from one approver to another, across multiple organizations (example: schools, third party servicing companies, and Federal Student Aid).<br /><br />4. The system shall maintain a hierarchical system of approval, where a limited number of individuals within each organization possess a "Primary Administrator" role, and are responsible for approving (and regularly re-certifying) organizational staff requests for access to FSA systems. <br /><br />5. The system shall capture and store results of all "access rights" applications.<br /><br />6. The system shall be capable of generating and assigning unique "mailboxes" (a unique address identifier) for users and organizations to be used with FSA's Student Access Internet Gateway (SAIG) system. <br /><br />7. The system shall interface with other FSA business systems to provide real-time user "access rights" data to those systems as part of the web login process.<br /><br />8. The system shall also interface with FSA's Access and Identity Management system to authenticate user logins to FSA business systems.<br /><br />9. The system shall generate periodic email notices to all key approvers ("Primary Administrators") to re-certify that the individuals they're responsible for at their institutions are still with the organization and still require access. <br /><br />10. The system shall provide key approvers with the ability to electronically (and annually) re-certify each user under their purview for each electronic service that user should have access to.<br /><br />11. The system shall provide FSA and contractor staff the capability to query its database and provide reports using any of the data elements stored within the database. <br /><br />12. The system shall provide the capability to view, create new, modify services associated with, or delete "mailboxes" (essentially, secure electronic mailboxes that can send files to/receive files from FSA systems). <br /><br />13. The system shall provide the capability to view, add new, or change an existing user's access rights.<br /><br />14. The system shall include a Customer Service Website, used by support staff to conduct research and troubleshoot user problems.<br /><br />15. The system shall provide a method for users to apply for access that shields Personally Identifiable Information (like SSN, mother's maiden name, etc.) from mid-level approvers.<br /><br />16. The system shall be designed in such a way that it is easily (and cheaply) scaled up/down whenever new electronic services, organization types, or user types are added to or deleted from the list of items managed by the application. <br /><br />17. The system shall interface with FSA's Post-Secondary Education Participant System or Integrated Partner Management system to receive and process School File data.<br /><br />18. The system shall be able to store, display, and export official "acknowledgement" documents and agreements which applicants shall read and agree to.<br /><br />19. The system shall be able to capture and store "e-signatures" from approvers of access rights requests throughout multiple stages of approval process.</p>
<p><br /><strong>C. Submission Process</strong><br />This request is to gather information from interested parties and is deemed essential as part of our planning and market research process for continuing operations, support and maintenance of the FSA PM system.</p>
<p>Documentation of technical expertise must be presented in sufficient detail for the Government to determine that your company possesses the necessary functional area expertise. Standard company brochures will not be reviewed. Submissions are not to exceed ten (10) pages in no less than 12 font size.</p>
<p>Interested parties may submit questions regarding this&nbsp;RFI via email no later than <strong>October 31, 2017 by 12:00pm EST</strong> to the points of contact listed below. Questions received after this time may not be answered.</p>
<p>Responses shall be emailed no later than <strong>November 7, 2017 by 12:00pm EST</strong> to the points of contact listed below. The preferred media is electronic files in Microsoft Word, Power Point, Excel or PDF (or similar).</p>

<DESC>THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE IS AN ADVANCE NOTICE FOR INFORMATION, MARKET RESEARCH, AND PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.&nbsp; THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS. THERE WILL NOT BE A SOLICITATION AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.&nbsp; THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF MARKET RESEARCH ONLY AND MAY OR MAY NOT TRANSLATE INTO AN ACTUAL PROCUREMENT.&nbsp; THERE IS NO FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. <br /><br />The U.S. Navy is issuing this Sources Sought Notice as a means of conducting market research to identify parties having both the interest and the resources to support Landing Craft, Air Cushion (LCAC) Service Life Extension Program (SLEP) requirements. As LCACs reach the end of their extended operational service life, shortfalls will exist in ship-to-shore lift capabilities.&nbsp; This will exacerbate the inherent challenges and limitations of supporting ship-to-shore movement and operations across the Range of Military Operations.&nbsp; The result of this market research will contribute to the identification of potential bidders for the potential Fiscal Year (FY)17/FY19 LCAC SLEP procurement.<br /><br />This notice is seeking business sources in the United States capable of performing LCAC SLEP efforts at either Assault Craft Unit 4 (ACU 4), Joint Expeditionary Base, Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, VA or at the prospective Contractor's owned facility. <br /><br />The type of work to be accomplished includes repair and installation of hull structures, machinery, electrical systems, electronics, and piping systems. Integration of Government Furnished Property (GFP) (e.g. LCAC unique cable, the Command, Control, Communications, Computers &amp; Navigation (C4N) suite and ETF40B gas turbine engines) into the craft utilizing a mature build-to-print Technical Data Package (TDP) is also required.&nbsp; The TDP consists of work items and associated drawings, test procedures, technical manuals, and a GFP list for each craft. Portions of this work will require an environmentally protected facility for the LCAC during the availability. Prospective Contractors will not be required to perform the work at the ACU, a Government owned facility, but may perform the LCAC SLEP at their owned facility. <br /><br />It is anticipated that a site visit and informational briefing will be conducted at Assault Craft Unit 4 (ACU 4), Joint Expeditionary Base, Little Creek-Fort Story, Virginia Beach, VA during the week of 4 December 2017. The site visit will allow prospective Contractors an opportunity to survey designated LCACs (SLEP craft and non-SLEP craft) as well as the site of the LCAC SLEP work done at the ACU.&nbsp; An additional notice will be provided via FEDBIZOPPs at a later date detailing specific information regarding the site visit.<br /><br />Interested parties do not have to provide the informational response detailed below in order to attend the site visit.<br /><br />No later than 1600 EDT, 7 November 2017, interested business sources shall provide notice of interest and the following informational response to both Points of Contact listed below.&nbsp; Informational responses shall be provided via email only and should be limited to three (3) pages. Telephonic responses are not acceptable. The informational responses shall contain unclassified information only and include the following:<br /><br />1. Company Information <br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Organizational Name, Mailing Address and Website Address
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Point of Contact</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Name<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii.

<p>2. Capabilities and expected ability to meet LCAC SLEP scope as referenced above (e.g., repair, installation, environmentally protected facilities) including a description of the Contractor owned facility if contemplating the place of performance will not be at the ACU.</p>
<p>3. Past experience performing construction and modernization of vessels of similar dimensions and characteristics highlighting:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Construction and modernization<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Organic or subcontracted?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. Teaming arrangement?</p>
<p>b. Familiarity with Government contract requirements</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Give examples of successful Government contracts of similar scope of work.</p>
<p>4. Feedback to the following Government questions to industry:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Is there anything related to the intended procurement of FY 17/FY19 LCAC SLEP that would prevent your company from performing the required work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Such as, certain contract types, work location, scope of work and material procurement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Do you have any suggestions that may potentially improve the Government's approach?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Do you have any questions you would like to see addressed prior to RFP release?</p>
<p>Note: Should no party other than the current LCAC SLEP incumbent provide a notice of interest, the Government may proceed with a synopsis for this effort as a sole-source procurement.<br /><br />NOTICES REGARDING SOLICITATION: This notice does NOT constitute a Request for Proposal and is not to be construed as a commitment, implied or otherwise, by the Government that a procurement action will be issued. No telephone inquiries will be accepted and request for solicitation packages will not be honored. Response to this notice is not a request to be added to a bidders list or to receive a copy of a solicitation. THE GOVERNMENT DOES NOT INTEND TO AWARD A CONTRACT SOLELY ON THE BASIS OF THIS SOURCES SOUGHT NOTICE.<br /><br />The Government may not respond to any specific questions or comments submitted in response to this special notice or any information provided as a result of this request.

<DESC><p>This Request for Information (RFI) is not a solicitation for proposals, proposal abstracts, quotations or obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services, but for planning purposes only. This RFI is to gain knowledge of potential qualified sources and to explore industry capabilities. Your response to this RFI will be treated as information only. No entitlement to payment of direct or indirect costs or charges by the Government will arise as a result of contractor submission to this announcement or the Government use of such information. The information provided may be used by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in developing its acquisition strategy, statement of work/statement of objectives, and performance specifications. Interested parties are responsible for adequately marking proprietary or competition sensitive information contained in their response. The Government does not intend to award a contract on the basis of this request for information or to otherwise pay for the information submitted in response to this RFI.</p>
<p>The purpose of this RFI is to gather Industry's input regarding a requirement supporting the USSOCOM, Special Operations Forces Acquisition Technology and Logistics (SOF AT&amp;L), Program Executive Officer for Command, Control, Communications, Computers (PEO - C4), Program Manager for Special Operations Forces Tactical Communications.</p>
<p>Responses to this RFI will be used by USSOCOM, PEO-C4 to identify potential architectures and equipment for participation in the further evaluation of market information and/or ascertain potential market capacity to provide services consistent in scope and scale with those described in this notice.</p>
<p>The Program Manager is specifically interested in 5G architectures and technologies, ideas and solutions which advance communications capability in the following Key Interest Areas:</p>
<p>- Advanced Heterogeneous Networks (HETNET) architecture and systems (3G, 4G, 5G, WiFi combined)<br />- 802.11 ax infrastructure and end points<br />- 802.11 ad infrastructure and end points<br />- Millimeter Wave technology<br />- Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) architectures and systems<br />- Advanced Antenna solutions for efficient connectivity at high wireless bandwidth (&gt;800Mbps) with benefits in RF congested or contested environments<br />- Military Internet of Things/Secure Machine to Machine - Force protection/perimeter/<br />- Next Generation end user devices planned, developed, or available with 5G connectivity<br />- Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) and application development with a 5G architecture focus<br />- Network, baseband, radio access virtualization focused in network densification<br />- Network slicing architectures and systems focused on 5G bandwidths and scale<br />- Self-Organizing Network (SON) architectures and systems<br />- Femto Application Platform Interface (FAPI) and Network Functional Application Platform Interface (nFAPI) technologies<br />- Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) architectures and systems</p>
<p>PEO-C4 is seeking potential solutions with the below criteria as initial guidance but not formal direction:</p>
<p>Solutions that enable a military "smart city" can be ranged for 1km squared area with &gt; 300 roaming users, 10 km squared area with &gt; 600 roaming users and 30km square area with 10000 roaming users. Users are persons, machines, vehicles and in all cases will be a mixture of operational functions from Command, Control, and Communications (C3), to Force Protection (FP), to Signals Intelligence (SI) as examples.</p>
<p>PEO-C4 will be hosting a demonstration/briefing/working group during the week of 19-21 December 2017. PEO-C4 is requesting that industry submit white papers, at no cost to the Government, specific to &ge; Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 5G architecture and/or solutions that will scope future connectivity architecture and updated communications capabilities for tactical networks. TRL 5 is identified as a breadboard technology and must undergo more rigorous testing than technology that is only at TRL 4. Simulations should be run in environments that are as close to realistic as possible. PEO-C4 is requesting that each white paper include a detailed description of the either current 5G capabilities of the system (again &ge; TRL 5) or planned systems that are expected to be at TRL &ge; 5. Based on the white paper responses PEO-C4 will determine which vendors qualify for the demonstration/briefing. The Government is aware of many 5G pilots with varying focuses throughout the country and would also be interested in technical data, lessons-learned to date for those environments. Interested parties who consider themselves qualified to perform the above listed services are invited to submit a response to this notice no later than 17 November 2017, 12:00 PM Eastern. All responses and any questions under this RFI shall be emailed to C4_RFI@socom.mil. PEO-C4 will notify all vendors via email by 24 November 2017 regarding their eligibility for the demonstration.</p>
<p>There is no solicitation/ request for proposal (RFP) at this time. This RFI does not constitute a RFP. Submission of any information in response to this market survey is purely voluntary. The Government assumes no financial responsibility for any costs incurred and will not provide responses to any questions. PEO-C4 will not provide any funding for vendors to demonstrate their capability but will support with facilities, services, and systems if possible. If USSOCOM decides to solicit proposals in the future, USSOCOM Contracting will issue a formal RFP at that time. Please note, telephone inquiries will not be accepted or acknowledged, and no feedback or evaluations will be provided to companies regarding their submissions.</p>

If any contractor/sub-contractor retained to do work for VA under this IAA requires access, use, etc., of VA SPI as aforesaid, and if an actionable data breach occurs because of the contractor/subcontractor s acts, omissions, or negligence in following the VA-directed security controls, enhancements, compensating controls, protocols, and/or measures, including, but not limited to the sources above, the contractor/subcontractor is further subject to the statutory requirement to assess liquidated damages against contractors and/or subcontractors under 38 U.S.C. 5725 in the event of a breach of Sensitive Personal Information (SPI)/Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  Liquidated damages shall be assessed IAW VA Handbook 6500.6 Appendix C, Chapter 7. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES FOR DATA BREACH, para b.  per affected Veteran or beneficiary.  LD Title 38 U.S.C. 5725 language is included in text attached SOW Suggestion document but I could not locate a LD calculation form or formula.  
A breach in this context includes the unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or disclosure of VA SPI which compromises not only the information s security or privacy but that of the Veteran or beneficiary as well as the potential exposure or wrongful disclosure of such information as a result of a failure to follow proper data security controls and protocols.
C. The preceding shall not apply unless any contractor/subcontractor retained must access, use, store, modify, or transmit VA-owned SPI in the course of providing services, etc. to VA.

 b. FSAP Lockbox   for entities, outsourcer organizations and other service-related companies having lockbox operations that handle healthcare data.

Delivery requirements shall be specified under each individual order.

The proposed acquisition will consists of a 12 month base period and two (2) twelve (12) month option periods from the date of award.  However, the Government's decision as to whether or not to continue with the contract, upon annual review, will be based upon successful performance during each previous year and continued need.

The applicable North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) code is 339113, 
Surgical Appliance and Supplies Manufacturing.  All interested companies must be 
Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) prior to receiving an award.  You may 
access SAM at https://www.sam.gov/portal/public/SAM/.  All Offerors must be certified with the 
appropriate  NAICS code on VA Vendor Information Pages at https://www.vip.vetbiz.gov/.

This notice is for planning purpose only and does not constitute a commitment on the part of the Government to award a contract, nor does the Government intend to pay for any information submitted as a result of this notice.  This RFI is part of a continuous process for obtaining the latest information on the commercial status of the industry with respect to their current and near-term abilities.  The information provided herein is subject to change and in no way binds the Government to solicit for or award, a competitive contract.  It is emphasized that this is a notice solely for planning and informational purposes.

2.0 SCOPE:  

The scope of this effort falls in line with VA s mission, goals, and objectives in support of providing Veterans  care.  Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Systems are designed to treat open wounds by locally applying negative pressure to the wound site.  These systems consist of dressings, an evacuation tube, a collection canister, and a computer-controlled vacuum pump.  The dressings usually include a foam (e.g., black polyurethane, polyvinyl alcohol) dressing with an evacuation tube embedded in it and a transparent film dressing that is applied over the foam package to seal the foam and the tube.  The other end of the tube is connected to a fluid-collection canister, which, in turn, is attached to the vacuum pump.  The computer-controlled vacuum pump applies either continuous or intermittent negative pressure through the tube to the foam dressing, drawing off excess of interstitial fluids from the wound.  Negative-pressure wound-therapy systems decompress the capillaries and lymphatic vessels, thus improving blood flow to the wound and reestablishing normal circulation of interstitial fluids; they are intended to promote healing of wounds (e.g., chronic wounds, burns) that are difficult to heal using conventional treatments.

This requirement will be IAW FAR clause 52.211-6,  Brand Name or Equal  which requires that the offeror indicate each product that is being offered as an  equal  product.  For each equal product, the company must include a description reflecting the salient characteristics (SC) and level of quality that will satisfy the salient physical, functional, or performance characteristics of the equal product(s) specified in the solicitation.  The company must also clearly identify the item by brand name (if any) and make/model number.  Finally, the company must include descriptive literature, such as illustrations, drawings, or a clear reference to previously furnished descriptive data or information available to the Contracting Officer, and clearly describe any modifications it plans to make to a product to make it conform to the solicitation requirements.

<p>______________________________________________________________________<br />THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT A NOTICE OF SOLICITATION ISSUANCE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION (RFI) FOR PLANNING PURPOSES ONLY.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This RFI is ISSUED for the purpose of developing a viable solicitation that will best communicate the Government's requirements to industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The requested information is for planning purposes only and does NOT constitute a commitment, implied or otherwise, that a procurement action will be issued. No entitlement to payment by the Government of direct or indirect cost or charges will arise as a result of the submission of information in response to this RFI.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages for any improperly identified proprietary information. Proprietary information will be safe guarded in accordance with the applicable Government regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Formal notices will be posted on the Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) website, http://www.fbo.gov/.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in">DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government is interested in obtaining information concerning a replacement for an existing high-voltage, direct-current power supply for an arc-heated test facility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The power supply shall provide increased capability for a Test and Evaluation facility that uses the power supply connected to an arc heater (one of three that share a common infrastructure) to generate the required test conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government expects that the system will be a fully integrated system consisting of transformer and rectifier equipment that operates in coordination with auxiliary equipment including, but not limited to, appropriate buses, breakers, and health monitoring devices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This equipment must convert 161kV TVA line voltage to DC power from a low power requirement of nominally 5 MW up to 225 MW.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The overarching requirement for the system is that it be configurable to deliver a pre-specified level of current to the arc heater over the duration of a test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><em style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PURPOSE</span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based upon the operating characteristics and ranges described below, the Government solicits input from industry and others regarding methods for designing, manufacturing, commissioning, operating, and maintaining such a system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government expects, based upon responses, to solicit further input to this RFI and then host an Industry Day, which will prepare the Government to issue a Solicitation (Request For Proposals) to provide the power supply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All respondents that can provide any of the requested information should reply in writing (electronic responses) to the contract specialist, Adam Foret at <a href="mailto:adam.foret.1@us.af.mil">adam.foret.1@us.af.mil</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0in">OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Existing</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The existing system is comprised of a tap changing transformer, a set of reactors downstream of the transformer, and an uncontrolled rectifier that converts the AC power to DC power for the arc heater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The tap of the transformer is configured to deliver the required current for a given test.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The start sequence for the arc heater requires rapidly increasing voltage across the electrodes of the heater to initiate an arc that bridges the gap, causing a sudden decrease in the resistance between the electrodes and a drop in voltage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Simultaneous to closing the breaker for the electrical circuit, a quick opening valve is actuated to introduce the test medium (high pressure air) to the heater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At this point, the current to the heater must be maintained at the desired amperage as the voltage across the heater climbs to compensate for the increasing resistance of the test medium. Upon reaching the desired pressure in the heater, the system sources current at the pre-selected value while passively adjusting the voltage in response to the dynamically changing load resistance of the arc heater.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Representative power levels at which the existing system has operated (Voltage is across the heater, not the output of the rectifier) are:</p>

<DESC>This is NOT an announcement for a forthcoming acquisition, but is an informational announcement and an invitation to interested U.S. entities not already participating in the VICTORY Standards Body to consider participation starting in December 2017.<br /><br />The acronym "VICTORY" stands for, Vehicular Integration for Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance/Electronic Warfare (C4ISR/EW) Interoperability, which is an initiative to develop, validate, verify, and maintain a set of open standard specifications to improve the integration approach for C4ISR/EW and related mission equipment on military ground platforms. VICTORY standard specifications are developed for multi-vendor implementation, and the initial set of specifications is already being implemented in numerous Army and Marine Corps systems, as well as by commercial vendors. A critical set of VICTORY-enabled capabilities were successfully proven to increase operational effectiveness and efficiency during the Network Integration Experiment (NIE) 15.2 event. A series of subsequent activities highlighted increased capabilities. VICTORY is recognized as a critical enabler for the Assured Position, Navigation and Time (APNT) program, and the primary Army PEOs responsible for ground vehicles and mission equipment have issued policies requiring the use of the VICTORY standard specifications.<br /><br />VICTORY standard specifications are developed within an open Standards Body maturation process, including both Government and Industry members, and the development effort is ongoing. The Standards Body is encouraging additional Federal Government and defense-industry partners to join this open standards development effort. Additional participation affords the Standards Body further expertise. It provides members foreknowledge of the emerging specifications, and an opportunity to help to shape their technical development. Both aspects provide industry partners risk reduction for current and future business. The VICTORY Standards Body began operation in May 2010. It has produced a suite of artifacts, including architectural descriptions, standard specifications, reusable software and compliance test tools. The efforts of the VICTORY Standards Body are continuing, and interested parties still have the opportunity to participate. A complete list of VICTORY focus areas is included at the end of this announcement. Most of the work of the Standards Body is done virtually. Occasional Face-to-Face (F2F) Technical Interchange Meetings (TIMs) are held to address more complex issues and provide attendees with the top-level plans for VICTORY development and implementation.<br /><br />Additional details about the VICTORY initiative and Standards Body are available on the VICTORY public website - http://www.VICTORY-standards.org. This unrestricted site provides an initial overview and information on how to register for the controlled-access secure VICTORY web portal - https://portal.VICTORY-standards.org (CAC or ECA certificate required). Registration instructions for this secure portal are available on the VICTORY public website. Participation in the VICTORY Standards Body, and access to VICTORY artifacts, are limited to U.S. Government Agencies and U.S. Government contractors and subcontractors.<br /><br />The next VICTORY Standards Body F2F TIM will take place December 13-14, 2017 at the Detroit Arsenal, Warren, Michigan. The focus of this TIM is three-fold: 1) continue the on-going working group discussions and provide an architectural update; 2) engage new industry partners and Government agencies to participate in the Standards Body; and 3) provide an update of Army programs implementing VICTORY standard specifications. Registration is required to access Detroit Arsenal for the event, and the registration period is open from 20 October - 27 November 2017. Details for this F2F TIM are posted on the VICTORY public site, http://ww.VICTORY-standards.org (click on the Face-to-Face Meetings link on the left side of the main page).<br /><br />Formal membership in the Standards Body is NOT a requirement for participation in either VICTORY activities or acquisitions citing VICTORY standard specifications, unless explicitly called for in program-specific documents released by the applicable contracting office.<br /><br />Complete List of VICTORY Capability Areas: <br />1.

<DESC>This special notice informs the public that North Cascades NPS Complex intends to award a non-competitive requirements contract for barge transportation services using a firm-fixed price schedule and paying for actual services received. The Contractor's barge will transport materials, supplies, bulk fuel, vehicles, and equipment for NPS operations and special projects between Stehekin and Chelan, WA, and points in between. A signed Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition is on file; the contents are provided herein.
JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION for SIMPLIFIED ACQUISITIONS OVER $3,500 AND UP TO $150,000 (See FAR 13.106-1)
Prepared in accordance with AP&P 1443.06-01 Enhancing Competition and Contracting by Other than Full and Open Competition, Rev. 1 (dated 6/2/2016)

Date:  10/18/2017		PR Number: R9473183005

Transportation services by barge to and from Stehekin and Chelan, WA and points in between, of materials, supplies, bulk fuel, vehicles, and equipment for NPS operations and special projects.  Stehekin is a remote community located at the head of Lake Chelan.  No roads connect Stehekin to outside sources of supplies and materials and all such items must be transported approximately 50 miles via boat or barge.  NPS will award a non-competitive requirements contract using a firm-fixed price schedule based on square-footage of deck space used, ease of handling, etc.; payment will be made based on actual services received.  Prices will be comparable to those charged to the public.  Total cost for fiscal year 2018 is expected to be between $10,000 and $25,000 and will not exceed the Simplified Acquisition Threshold ($150,000).  The contract year runs November 1 through October 31.
Annual costs during the recent past are:
FY17    $18,000             actual through September 30 plus estimate for October
FY16	$32,312		
FY15	$33,577		
FY14	$86,854		increased use due to wildfires and rock hauling
FY13	$40,700		
FY12	$28,750
FY11	$67,173		increased use due to hauling rock for road repairs and re-routes
FY10	$98,306		increased use due to wildfires
FY09	$44,653
FY08	$34,178

2.  Sole Source Justification rationale (Check one and explain below):
__X__	Only one responsible source. 
______	Urgent and compelling circumstances exist. 
______ Other   _____________________________________________________ 
Only one vendor, Mountain Barge Services LLC operates a barge capable of providing the required freight transportation services on Lake Chelan.  

3.  Market Research.  Please explain the results or why one was not performed. State whether any other offers were received or anyone expressed interest:  
Web searches using Google, YellowPages, and SuperPages found only the one barge company noted above.  A Special Notice for this action will be posted at FBO, and any information received in response will be taken under consideration by NPS.  Local knowledge of the vendor pool indicates this is the only viable service. 

4.  If this is a determination for sole source, the Contracting Officer certifies:
a.	Only one source is available, or urgent and compelling circumstances exist.
b.	The anticipated price will be determined fair and reasonable using the price analysis techniques described in FAR Part 13.106-3(a).

<DESC>The Coast Guard Surface Forces Logistics Center (SFLC) is the single logistics center for the Coast Guard surface fleet, providing engineering, maintenance, supply and technical information services to Coast Guard cutters and boats stationed throughout the United States. The SFLC purchases a wide variety of marine goods and services and we are committed to small business participation in our acquisition programs to support the fleet. The SFLC posts its upcoming forecast of opportunities on the Acquisition Planning Forecast System (APFS) which is a portal for small business vendors to view projections of all anticipated opportunities estimated to exceed $150,000 that small businesses may be able to perform under direct contracts with the SFLC or perform part of the effort through subcontracts. APFS identifies all upcoming forecasted, but not necessarily funded, opportunities at http://apfs.dhs.gov/.
<p>We hope that APFS will assist you in doing business with the SFLC. By helping vendors identify procurement opportunities as early in the acquisition process as possible, we hope to improve communication with industry and assist the small business community with its marketing efforts. Vendors seeking to track upcoming SFLC opportunities may register to be notified when anticipated opportunities are published in APFS. APFS is continually updated and informs the public of projected requirements estimated to exceed $150,000, early in the process. Information on this site is organized in a manner to permit various data sorts, and the individual items include descriptions of required supplies, services and program points of contacts (POC's). Market efforts are most effectively conducted with the Program Offices, since they originate the requirement and prepare its associated market research report. Vendors are encouraged to have their technical experts communicate with our technical personnel, as their knowledge of advances in technology and the firm's capabilities are much more helpful to us than generic sales presentations.</p>

<DESC>This is a combined synopsis/solicitation under FAR Part 13 using simplified acquisition procedures as supplemented by the commercial service procedures in FAR Part 12 under the Federal Acquisition Regulation. This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will not be issued.
<p>Broadcasting Board of Governors' (BBG) Office of Internet Freedom (OIF) is issuing this request for proposal for the purpose of holding an "Open Season" period under which Basic Ordering Agreements will be awarded to vendors to allow them to compete for future work under the agency's multiple-award/multiple task-area Blanket Ordering Agreement (BOA) number BBG50-G-15-0006, copy of which is included as an attachment.</p>
<p>The solicitation number is 951700-R-18-0001 and is being issued as a Request for Proposal (RFP) for its Internet Censorship Circumvention Tools BOA. This competitive procurement will be used to select additional awardees who may compete for orders under task areas 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the BOA. The agency has no plans to award work under task area 3 at this time. The competition is open to all responsible business concerns having the requisite technical capabilities necessary to provide Internet Censorship Circumvention Tools.</p>
<p>The agency is holding this Open Season period with the intent of improving competition, access to innovative and improved technologies and capabilities, enhanced metrics, improved performance and competitive pricing.<br />The associated NAICS code is 541511 Custom Computer Programming Services,  with a small business standard size of $27.5 Million. Offerors must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) at http://www.sam.gov, in order to be considered for award.</p>
<p>General BOA Information</p>
<p>The Internet Censorship Circumvention Tools Blanket Ordering Agreement was awarded as a multiple-award/multiple task-area agreement, which is currently in its second year of a five year ordering period. The BOA promotes the use of performance-based contracting and accommodates task orders issued with the following terms: fixed-price (FP) and time-and-materials (T&amp;M).<br />The agency intends to hold competitive procurements for the issuance of new task orders shortly after concluding Open Season awardee selections. The agency anticipates that new task order solicitations will be issued during mid to end of fall, 2017. However, the exact date for issuance of new task order solicitations is not guaranteed and may occur later in the year.</p>
<p>Overall Scope of BOA</p>
<p>The overall purpose of the BOA and the general scope of work for task orders awarded under the BOA is to obtain Internet censorship circumvention tools and services. The primary supplies and services required under this contract relate to state-of-the art, specialized information technology (IT) software and systems for circumventing Internet censorship by foreign governments, and require active, ongoing maintenance and support throughout the term of the Task Orders by the Contractor to ensure required service levels.</p>
<p><br />Synopsis of Task Areas 1, 2, 4 and 5<br />The type of work projects planned for task areas 1, 2, 4 and 5 is synopsized below.</p>
<p>Task Area 1 - Circumvention Client Software<br />The contractor shall provide a system to circumvent Internet censorship imposed by foreign governments and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) using client software technology, which, at a minimum, transparently proxies HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic, and may, based on individual Task Order requirements, implement transparent proxy services for additional protocol traffic, up to and including full Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.  This system will work on operating systems as specified in each individual Task Order, which may include various desktop and mobile computing devices. This system must allow Internet users in target countries to use this client software package to circumvent the censorship of the Internet within their country.</p>
<p>Task Area 2 - Clientless Web Proxies<br />The Contractor shall provide a network of web proxies which may be accessed by any web browser which supports Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) and which can be distributed by BBG broadcasters.  This system must allow Internet users in target countries to circumvent the censorship of the Internet within their country by accessing web proxies operated by the Contractor which are distributed globally and use a diverse set of domain names and dynamic IP addresses which cannot easily be discovered, enumerated, and blocked. The proxy sites will need to be changed regularly, based on the specifics of site blockages in the target countries.</p>
<p>Task Area 4 - Electronic Mail Newsletter Distribution<br />The Contractor shall distribute an electronic mail (email) newsletter provided by BBG broadcasters to a list of electronic mail addresses provided by the broadcasters, and validated by the Contractor, on a schedule as specified in the Task Order.  The Contractor shall evade attempts by foreign governments to censor these newsletters by a variety of techniques.</p>
<p>Task Area 5 - Censorship Circumvention Technical Expertise and Support<br />The Contractor shall provide technical expertise in Internet censorship circumvention to further the BBG's other Internet anti-censorship initiatives.  This may consist of producing technical documentation and reports on the current state of Internet censorship in target countries; providing computer programming and software engineering for BBG's internal software products, open source software, or other Contractor's software; or setup, maintenance, and operation of computer systems and network devices.</p>
<p>PERIOD OF PERFORMANCE<br />The BOA is currently in its second option year. The ordering period consists of a one (1) year base period and four (4) one-year optional periods of performance.

<DESC><p>The U. S. Postal Service plans to issue a Fixed Price Contract to complete a renovation project at the Denver CO P&amp;DC located at 7540 E 53rd Street, Denver, CO 80266. All work will be done in accordance with USPS approved specifications and drawings.</p>
<p>The estimated cost range of the project is $1,750,000&nbsp;to $2,000,000 with construction completion within&nbsp;240 calendar days from receipt of notice to proceed. Contractors must submit a Qualification Statement and a Management Plan with their price proposal. Only the most qualified contractors will be considered.<br />To be considered, a company must meet the following minimum requirements:<br />(1) Contractors must be licensed, as required by the State, to perform the work as stated in this solicitation. USPS does not exempt suppliers from licensure for federal projects unless indicated otherwise in the solicitation. <br />(2) Contractors must have been in the construction business for a minimum of five years as of the date of this solicitation. There is no requirement that eligible contracting firms remained the identical entity for the five-year period, although legal entity changes (such as from a partnership to a corporation) that occurred during this five-year period should be clearly explained, and if key personnel were retained, this should also be clearly explained. <br />(3) Contractor must be capable of obtaining performance and payment bonds for 100% of the contract price.<br />(4) Contractors must provide their EMR rating on insurance company letterhead. If the EMR rating is greater than 1.0, the contractor must provide an explanation from its insurance company in order to be given further consideration for prequalification.<br />(5) Company must submit information for three comparable projects that have either been completed within the past five years or are currently ongoing. Comparable projects are defined as renovation projects with similar scopes of work and costs of $750,000 or more.</p>
<p>The Qualification Statements will be evaluated in accordance with the criteria stated: experience/performance and capabilities. The price proposals for only the most highly qualified contractors will be considered.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is more concerned with making an award at the lowest overall price than with obtaining superior technical or management features. However, the Postal Service may not necessarily make an award at the lowest price in order to achieve a small price savings if better value can be achieved with superior technical or management features. The benefits of a higher priced proposal may merit a higher price. The evaluation factors outlined in Section 2-26.2, of the Supplying Principles and Practices, listed in descending order of importance, will be used in the evaluation of proposals.<br />prequalified contractors will be placed on a list for inclusion in future solicitations in this area with similar scopes of work. There is no guarantee that a specific number of solicitations will be issued to these prequalified contractors.</p>
<p>A PRE PROPOSAL MEETING WILL BE HELD AT THE SITE ON OCTOBER 18, 2017, AT 10:30 A.M. ATTENDANCE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p>
<p>The SOLICITATION PACKAGE is attached to this posting.</p>
<p>QUESTIONS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO Paige Lyne, <a href="mailto:jacquelyn.p.lyne@usps.gov">jacquelyn.p.lyne@usps.gov</a> or Tom Pio, <a href="mailto:thomas.m.pio@usps.gov">thomas.m.pio@usps.gov</a>.&nbsp;Deadline for questions is noon on 10-24-17.</p>
<p>Submit proposals via Emptoris, the USPS esourcing venue. The link https://uspsesourcing.emptoris.com/sso/jsp/login.jsp For help with the eSourcing program, please contact the USPS eSourcing at esourcing@usps.gov or call 1-800-332-0317, options 4 and 5.

If responding to a specific solicitation, please notify us after registration so that we may add you to the invitation list to view the documents.</p>

Upon award, the name of the successful offeror and the amount of the contract will be released as public information. The names of offerors and the amount of their offers will not be released as public information. This information is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, Exception 4.</p>

However, you can also protest to Headquarters (HQ), Army Materiel Command (AMC).  The HQ AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to seek resolution of their concerns within AMC as an Alternative Dispute Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO.  The AMC protest decision goal is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing.  To be timely, protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.103. If you want to file a protest under the HQ AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted. <br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded. <br />(ii) Examples. <br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

The liability is finally determined if it has been assessed. A liability is not finally determined if there is a pending administrative or judicial challenge. In the case of a judicial challenge to the liability, the liability is not finally determined until all judicial appeal rights have been exhausted.<br />(B) The taxpayer is delinquent in making payment. A taxpayer is delinquent if the taxpayer has failed to pay the tax liability when full payment was due and required. A taxpayer is not delinquent in cases where enforced collection action is precluded.<br />(ii) Examples.<br />(A) The taxpayer has received a statutory notice of deficiency, under I.R.C. &sect;6212, which entitles the taxpayer to seek Tax Court review of a proposed tax deficiency. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek Tax Court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appear rights.<br />(B) The IRS has filed a notice of Federal tax lien with respect to an assessed tax liability, and the taxpayer has been issued a notice under I.R.C. &sect;6320 entitling the taxpayer to request a hearing with the IRS Office of Appeals Contesting the lien filing, and to further appeal to the Tax Court if the IRS determines to sustain the lien filing. In the course of the hearing, the taxpayer is entitled to contest the underlying tax liability because the taxpayer has had no prior opportunity to contest the liability. This is not a delinquent tax because it is not a final tax liability. Should the taxpayer seek tax court review, this will not be a final tax liability until the taxpayer has exercised all judicial appeal rights.<br />(C) The taxpayer has entered into an installment agreement pursuant to I.R.C. &sect;6159. The taxpayer is making timely payments and is in full compliance with the agreement terms. The taxpayer is not delinquent because the taxpayer is not currently required to make full payment.<br />(D) The taxpayer has filed for bankruptcy protection. The taxpayer is not delinquent because enforced collection action is stayed under 11 U.S.C. &sect;362 (the Bankruptcy Code).<br />(i) Certification Regarding Knowledge of Child Labor for Listed End Products (Executive Order 13126).

<p>"Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number" means the 9-digit number assigned by Dun and Bradstreet, Inc. (D&amp;B) to identify unique business entities, which is used as the identification number for Federal Contractors.</p>
<p>"Data Universal Numbering System+4 (DUNS+4) number" means the DUNS number assigned by D&amp;B plus a 4-character suffix that may be assigned by a business concern. (D&amp;B has no affiliation with this 4-character suffix.) This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

<p>(4) The Government has marked the record "Active".</p>

<p>(b) The Contractor is responsible for the accuracy and completeness of the data within the SAM database, and for any liability resulting from the Government's reliance on inaccurate or incomplete data. To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA <br />0002 Monitor 20 EA</p>

<p><br />MSC SPECIFIC WIDE AREA WORKFLOW (WAWF) INSTRUCTIONS (AUG 2012)</p>
<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>
<p>Before closing out of an invoice session in WAWF, but after submitting the document or documents, the Contractor will be given the option to send additional email notifications by clicking on the "Send More Email Notifications" link that appears on the page. The Contractor shall click on this link and add the Technical Point of Contact's (TPOC) or Contracting Officer's Representative's (COR) email address in the first email address block and add any other additional email addresses desired in the following blocks. This additional notification to the Government is important to ensure the acceptor/receiver is aware that the invoice documents have been submitted into the WAWF system.</p>

This 4-character suffix may be assigned at the discretion of the business concern to establish additional SAM records for identifying alternative Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) accounts (see the FAR at subpart 32.11) for the same concern.</p>
<p>"Registered in the System for Award Management (SAM) database" means that-</p>
<p>(1) The Contractor has entered all mandatory information, including the DUNS number or the DUNS+4 number, the Contractor and government Entity (CAGE) code, as well as data required by the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (see subpart 4.14), into the SAM database;</p>
<p>(2) The Contractor has completed the Core, Assertions, Representations and Certifications, and Points of Contact sections of the registration in the SAM database;</p>
<p>(3) The Government has validated all mandatory data fields, to include validation of the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

To remain registered in the SAM database after the initial registration, the Contractor is required to review and update on an annual basis, from the date of initial registration or subsequent updates, its information in the SAM database to ensure it is current, accurate and complete. Updating information in the SAM does not alter the terms and conditions of this contract and is not a substitute for a properly executed contractual document.</p>
<p>(c)<br />(1)<br />(i) If a Contractor has legally changed its business name, doing business as name, or division name (whichever is shown on the contract), or has transferred the assets used in performing the contract, but has not completed the necessary requirements regarding novation and change-of-name agreements in subpart 42.12, the Contractor shall provide the responsible Contracting Officer a minimum of one business day's written notification of its intention to-</p>

<p>(3) The Contractor shall ensure that the DUNS number is maintained with Dun &amp; Bradstreet throughout the life of the contract.

<p>252.204-7011 Alternative Line Item Structure (Sep 2011)</p>
<p><br />a) Line items are the basic structural elements in a solicitation or contract that provide for the organization of contract requirements to facilitate pricing, delivery, inspection, acceptance and payment. Line items are organized into contract line items, subline items, and exhibit line items. Separate line items should be established to account for separate pricing, identification (see section 211.274 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement), deliveries, or funding. The Government recognizes that the line item structure in this solicitation may not conform to every offeror's practices. Failure to correct these issues can result in difficulties in accounting for deliveries and processing payments. Therefore, offerors are invited to propose an alternative line item structure for items on which bids, proposals, or quotes are requested in this solicitation to ensure that the resulting contract structure is economically and administratively advantageous to the Government and the Contractor.</p>
<p>(b) If an alternative line item structure is proposed, the structure must be consistent with subpart 204.71 of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement and PGI 204.71 (DFARS/PGI view). A sample line item structure and a proposed alternative structure are as follows:</p>
<p>Solicitation:</p>
<p>ITEM<br />NO. SUPPLIES/SERVICE QUANTITY UNIT UNIT PRICE AMOUNT<br />0001 Computer, Desktop with CPU, Monitor, Keyboard and Mouse 20 EA</p>
<p>Alternative line item structure offer where monitors are shipped separately:</p>

The Contractor shall consult with the Department of State regarding any questions relating to compliance with the ITAR and shall consult with the Department of Commerce regarding any questions relating to compliance with the EAR.</p>
<p>(c) The Contractor's responsibility to comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding export-controlled items exists independent of, and is not established or limited by, the information provided by this clause.</p>
<p>(d) Nothing in the terms of this contract adds, changes, supersedes, or waives any of the requirements of applicable Federal laws, Executive orders, and regulations, including but not limited to-</p>
<p>(1) The Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401, et seq.);</p>

<p>The information contained in this instruction is supplemental to DFARS 252.232-7006.</p>
<p>The information contained in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006 is for WAWF purposes only. Information included in DFARS 252.232-7006 and this WAWF instruction apply only to WAWF Invoicing and WAWF Receiving Reports. Contradictory information elsewhere in this contract, e.g. Ship to DoDAAC, shall be followed per the terms and conditions of the contract.</p>
<p>When entering the invoice into WAWF, the Contractor shall fill in the DoDAAC fields or DoDAAC extensions exactly as shown in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. Fields that should not be filled in when entering the invoice into WAWF will be indicated with the direction, "Leave Blank."</p>
<p>In some situations the WAWF system will pre-populate the "Pay DoDAAC," "Admin By DoDAAC" and "Issue By DoDAAC." The Contractor shall verify that those DoDAACs automatically entered by the WAWF system match the information in the table in DFARS 252.232-7006. If these DoDAACs do not match, then the Contractor shall correct the field(s).</p>
<p>If Receiving Reports are required, ensure that the "Inspection" and "Acceptance" defaults of "destination" for both fields are not changed in the WAWF online interface.</p>
<p>The CLINs on the WAWF invoice shall be entered exactly as set forth in the contract document including CLIN number (e.g. 0001), Quantity (may be adjusted for actual quantity or dollar value delivered and invoiced), and Unit Price (e.g. $1.00). The dollar amounts on each CLIN or SubCLIN on the WAWF invoice shall reflect final performance values, but in no instance can the dollar amount for each CLIN or SubCLIN exceed what is specified in the contract document. The Contractor shall bill to the lowest level, e.g., the SubCLIN level. The Quantity and Unit of Measure fields must be filled out exactly as indicated in the CLINs and SubCLINs to reduce the possibility of the invoice being delayed or rejected during processing.</p>

This is a combined synopsis/solicitation for a commercial supply and/or service prepared in accordance with the format in FAR Subpart 12.6, as supplemented with additional information included in this notice.  This announcement constitutes the only solicitation; proposals are being requested and a written solicitation will NOT be issued.  This is a Request for Quote (RFQ) and the solicitation number is 36C24918Q0059.  The evaluation of offers received in response to the solicitation will use a tiered or cascading order of precedence.   Tiered evaluation of offers,  also known as  cascading evaluation of offers,  is a procedure used in negotiated acquisitions when market research is inconclusive for justifying limiting competition to small business concerns or sub-categories of small business concerns.  

The Contract Officer 

(1) Solicits offers from both small and other than small business concerns that will be evaluated in the following tiered order:

  (a) service-disabled veteran-owned small business (SDVOSB);
  (b) veteran-owned small business (VOSB);
  (c) all other small business concerns;
  (d) other than small business.

(2) If an award or a sufficient number of awards cannot be made at the first tier, evaluation of 
      offers will proceed at the next lower tier until an award or a sufficient number of awards can 
      be made.

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS <br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program <br />It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and time-consuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO). <br />Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman. <br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable). <br />Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest, protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program. Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand delivery to the Contracting Officer. <br />Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external forum, the agency protest will be dismissed. <br />The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

Solicitation number 70Z03818QB2000016 is issued as a Request for Quotation (RFQ). This solicitation document and incorporated provisions and clauses are those in effect through Federal Acquisition Circular (FAC) 2005-95 effective 19 January 2017.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<p>NOTICE FOR FILING AGENCY PROTESTS<br />United States Coast Guard Ombudsman Program</p>
<p>It is the policy of the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to issue solicitations and make contract<br />awards in a fair and timely manner. The Ombudsman Program for Agency Protests (OPAP) was<br />established to investigate agency protest issues and resolve them without expensive and timeconsuming litigation. OPAP is an independent reviewing authority that is empowered to grant a<br />prevailing protester essentially the same relief as the Government Accountability Office (GAO).</p>
<p>Interested parties are encouraged to seek resolution of their concerns within the USCG as an<br />Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) forum rather than filing a protest with the GAO or some<br />external forum. Interested parties may seek resolution of their concerns informally or opt to file<br />a formal agency protest with the Contracting Officer or Ombudsman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />Informal Forum with the Ombudsman. Interested parties who believe a specific USCG<br />procurement is unfair or otherwise defective should first direct their concerns to the applicable<br />Contracting Officer. If the Contracting Officer is unable to satisfy their concerns, interested<br />parties are encouraged to contact the U.S. Coast Guard Ombudsman for Agency Protests. Under<br />this informal process the agency is not required to suspend contract award performance. Use of<br />an informal forum does not suspend any time requirement for filing a protest with the agency or<br />other forum. In order to ensure a timely response, interested parties should provide the following<br />information to the Ombudsman: solicitation/contract number, contracting office, Contracting<br />Officer, and solicitation closing date (if applicable).</p>
<p>Formal Agency Protest with the Ombudsman. Prior to submitting a formal agency protest,<br />protesters must first use their best efforts to resolve their concerns with the Contracting Officer<br />through open and frank discussions. If the protester's concerns are unresolved, an Independent<br />Review is available by the Ombudsman. The protester may file a formal agency protest to either<br />the Contracting Officer or as an alternative to that, the Ombudsman under the OPAP program.<br />Contract award or performance will be suspended during the protest period unless contract award<br />or performance is justified, in writing, for urgent and compelling reasons or is determined in<br />writing to be in the best interest of the Government. The agency's goal is to resolve protests in<br />less than 35 calendar days from the date of filing. Protests shall include the information set forth<br />in FAR 33.103(d) (2). If the protester fails to submit the required information, resolution of the<br />protest may be delayed or the protest may be dismissed. To be timely protests must be filed<br />within the period specified in FAR 33.103(e). Formal protests filed under the OPAP program<br />should be submitted electronically to OPAP@uscg.mil and the Contracting Officer or by hand<br />delivery to the Contracting Officer.</p>
<p>Election of Forum. After an interested party protests a Coast Guard procurement to the<br />Contracting Officer or the Ombudsman, and while the protest is pending, the protester agrees not<br />to file a protest with the GAO or other external forum. If the protest is filed with an external<br />forum, the agency protest will be dismissed.</p>
<p>The Ombudsman Hotline telephone number is 202.372.3695.</p>

<DESC>The purpose of this amendment is to:
1) Change the ordering period from 10/01/2017 through 09/30/2018 to 11/01/2017 through 09/30/2018.
2) Change the contract type from a Firm Fixed Price, Requirements contract to a Firm Fixed Price, Indefinite-Delivery, Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) contract.
The following clauses are included:
52.216-18 ORDERING (OCT 1995)
  (a) Any supplies and services to be furnished under this contract shall be ordered by issuance of delivery orders or task orders by the individuals or activities designated in the Schedule. Such orders may be issued from 11/01/2017 through 9/30/2018.
  (b) All delivery orders or task orders are subject to the terms and conditions of this contract. In the event of conflict between a delivery order or task order and this contract, the contract shall control.
  (c) If mailed, a delivery order or task order is considered "issued" when the Government deposits the order in the mail. Orders may be issued orally, by facsimile, or by electronic commerce methods only if authorized in the Schedule.
52.216-19 ORDER LIMITATIONS (OCT 1995)
  (a) Minimum order.  When the Government requires supplies or services covered by this contract in an amount of less than $10.00, the Government is not obligated to purchase, nor is the Contractor obligated to furnish, those supplies or services under the contract.
  (b) Maximum order.  The Contractor is not obligated to honor 
    (1) Any order for a single item in excess of $50,000.00;
    (2) Any order for a combination of items in excess of $400,000.00; or
    (3) A series of orders from the same ordering office within 334 days that together call for quantities exceeding the limitation in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section.
  (c) If this is a requirements contract (i.e., includes the Requirements clause at subsection 52.216-21 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)), the Government is not required to order a part of any one requirement from the Contractor if that requirement exceeds the maximum-order limitations in paragraph (b) of this section.
  (d) Notwithstanding paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, the Contractor shall honor any order exceeding the maximum order limitations in paragraph (b), unless that order (or orders) is returned to the ordering office within 1 day after issuance, with written notice stating the Contractor's intent not to ship the item (or items) called for and the reasons.  Upon receiving this notice, the Government may acquire the supplies or services from another source.


52.216-22 INDEFINITE QUANTITY (OCT 1995)
  (a) This is an indefinite-quantity contract for the supplies or services specified, and effective for the period stated, in the Schedule.  The quantities of supplies and services specified in the Schedule are estimates only and are not purchased by this contract.
  (b) Delivery or performance shall be made only as authorized by orders issued in accordance with the Ordering clause.  The Contractor shall furnish to the Government, when and if ordered, the supplies or services specified in the Schedule up to and including the quantity designated in the Schedule as the "maximum." The Government shall order at least the quantity of supplies or services designated in the Schedule as the "minimum."
  (c) Except for any limitations on quantities in the Order Limitations clause or in the Schedule, there is no limit on the number of orders that may be issued.  The Government may issue orders requiring delivery to multiple destinations or performance at multiple locations.
  (d) Any order issued during the effective period of this contract and not completed within that period shall be completed by the Contractor within the time specified in the order.  The contract shall govern the Contractor's and Government's rights and obligations with respect to that order to the same extent as if the order were completed during the contract's effective period; provided, that the Contractor shall not be required to make any deliveries under this contract after delivering all items ordered on or before 09/30/2018.
3) As a result of these changes, the solicitation response due date has been extended to Thursday, October 26, 2017 at 4:00 PM EST.

name and part numbers AND salient characteristics of the items you are
proposing to sell to the Government. Regardless of the terminology used in
each  RFQ ("Brand Name or Equal", or "meet minimum stated specifications),
the information describing what you are offering must be physically written
into the seller's bid specification block. Salient characteristics are
defined as "pronounced features of an item that identify it describe its
size and composition, functional intent, and/or operational capabilities or
limits." When researching product capabilities, you must, as a minimum,
respond with feature for feature comparisons in order for your product to be
technically evaluated for sufficiency. Responses such as "bidding exact
match", "as specified", or cutting and pasting the Government's
specification information into the seller's bid specification block are not
acceptable responses. Offerors who respond in any of the three examples
directly above will be eliminated from the competition without consideration
of their offer. If you are bidding the same product as is being requested,
your seller bid specification should indicate: "Bidding on Manufacturer
(Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number). If you are bidding on an "or
equal" product, your seller bid specification must state: Bidding on
Manufacturer (Insert Name) and Part Number (Insert Number), containing the

commercial items in accordance with FAR 13.5.  Fedbid is NOT a forum for
filing protests against the Government.  Attempts to file protests through
Fedbid will not be considered legitimate as they do not conform to the
requirements in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR).  It is preferable
that disputes and protests be resolved as quickly as possible at the lowest
level possible before considering the more formal process described below.
The HQ, AMC-Level Protest Program is intended to encourage interested parties to
seek resolution of their concerns within AMC, as an Alternate Dispute
Resolution forum, rather than filing a protest with the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) or other external forum.  Contract award or
performance is suspended during the protest to the same extent, and within
the same time periods, as if filed at the GAO. The AMC protest decision goal
is to resolve protests within 20 working days from filing. To be timely,
protests must be filed within the periods specified in FAR 33.10. If you
want to file a protest under the AMC-Level Protest Program, the protest must
request resolution under that program and be sent to the address below.  All
other agency-level protests should be sent to the contracting officer for
resolution.  The address for filing a protest directly with AMC is: Headquarters U.S. Army Materiel Command Office of Command Counsel-Deputy Command Counsel 4400 Martin Road Rm: A6SE040.001 Redstone Arsenal, AL 35898-5000 Fax: (256) 450-8840 or e-mail: usarmy.redstone.usamc.mbx.protests@mail.mil.

(b) Under Section 8(a), the following types of activities are not forbidden compliance with the boycott, and are therefore exempted from Section 8(a)s prohibitions listed in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) above: SEE CONTINUATION below<BR><BR>Continuation of clause: (1) Complying or agreeing to comply with requirements: (i) Prohibiting the import of goods or services from Israel or goods produced or services provided by any business concern organized under the laws of Israel or by nationals or residents of Israel; or, (ii) Prohibiting the shipment of goods to Israel on a carrier of Israel, or by a route other than that prescribed by the boycotting country or the recipient of the shipment; (2) Complying or agreeing to comply with import and shipping document requirements with respect to the country of origin, the name of the carrier and route of shipment, the name of the supplier of the shipment or the name of the provider of other services, except that no information knowingly furnished or conveyed in response to such requirements may be stated in negative, blacklisting, or similar exclusionary terms, other than with respect to carriers or route of shipments as may be permitted by such regulations in order to comply with precautionary requirements protecting against war risks and confiscation; (3) Complying or agreeing to comply in the normal course of business with the unilateral and specific selection by a boycotting country, or national or resident thereof, of carriers, insurance, suppliers of services to be performed within the boycotting country or specific goods which, in the normal course of business, are identifiable by source when imported into the boycotting country; (4) Complying or agreeing to comply with the export requirements of the boycotting country relating to shipments or transshipments of exports to Israel, to any business concern of or organized under the laws of Israel, or to any national or resident of Israel; (5) Compliance by an individual or agreement by an individual to comply with the immigration or passport requirements of any country with respect to such individual or any member of such individuals family or with requests for information regarding requirements of employment of such individual within the boycotting country; and, (6) Compliance by a U.S. person resident in a foreign country or agreement by such person to comply with the laws of that country with respect to his or her activities exclusively therein, and such regulations may contain exceptions for such resident complying with the laws or regulations of that foreign country governing imports into such country of trademarked, trade named, or similarly specifically identifiable products, or components of products for his or her own use, including the performance of contractual services within that country, as may be defined by such regulations.

<DESC>Is there an incumbent? If so what is the contract number for the previous contract?
Answer:  The incumbent is Ronald M. Slusser (Slussco).
Travel is mentioned in the contract: "The contractor may be required to travel to Washington, D.C., or to other VA locations". What is the intent of travel? To present the final results? Kick-off meeting? Site evaluations? Since it's firm fixed price we need to know exactly what travel is required.
Answer:  There is no travel anticipated for this contract.  If travel would be required, it would likely be for travel to DC to present findings and would be approved and priced at that time.  But again, it is not anticipated that travel is necessary to complete this task.
Will in-person site visits be required for the ~170 VHA stations referenced? Or, will raw data be all that is required for analysis?
Answer:  Site visits are not necessary.  This is a data exercise and not a physical inspection of any sites.
If specific sites do require in-person visits, please inform location of each VHA station and estimated time on site.
Answer:  N/A, no site visits are necessary.
Due to short performance period, will all necessary VA personnel be promptly available to work with our schedule on site visits?
Answer:  N/A, no site visits are necessary.
Can performance period be extended to working day rather than calendar days?
Answer:  No, the performance period cannot be extended.  The analysis will feed the annual planning process and cannot be delayed that long.
Is there a GSA requirement for this solicitation?
Answer:  No, please disregard the following sentence in the quote format section of the solicitation    The Vendor s signed copy of their GSA Schedule contract with all modifications will not be counted in the page limit.

<p>General Information<br />Document Type: Request for Information<br />Posted Date: October 20, 2017<br />Response Date: November 3, 2017<br />NAICS Code: N/A</p>
<p>This request for information (RFI) is for planning purposes, and is not to be considered an invitation for bid, request for quotation, or as an obligation on the part of the Government to acquire any products or services. No reimbursement will be a made for any costs associated with providing information in response to this RFI or any follow up information request. Respondents will not be individually notified of the results of the evaluation of the information they provide. No contract award will be made on the basis of responses received. After review of the submissions, the Government may invite select vendors to present their solutions at the Defense Health Agency (DHA) Industry Exchange, on November 17, 2017. All submission costs, travel costs plus other associated costs relating to the presentation of information in response to this RFI will be at vendor's expense.</p>
<p>Purpose<br />The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI):</p>
<p>To obtain information regarding industry approaches for satisfying certain potential or prospective DHA or Military Health System (MHS) requirements. Vendors will submit information papers (as described below) for review by DHA personnel. Selected U.S. vendors will be notified by November 10, 2017 and invited to present their solutions for one of the topics identified in this announcement at the DHA Industry Exchange event on November 17, 2017, at their expense.</p>
<p>Background<br />The DHA is continuing to evolve its information technology (IT) infrastructure and is deploying a medical community of interest (MEDCOI) network. This network is an enterprise VPN service providing access and connectivity among our users in our medical treatment facilities (MTFs) and our IT systems. In this context, the DHA is interested in the topics addressing cyber security, integration of medical devices to include standardization and compliance, cloud service providers and it's capabilities for business intelligence or the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), business process re-engineering and analytics, home-health/Telehealth solutions, and development of effective cyber governance oversight and structure.</p>
<p>Description<br />DHA will use the information provided to determine those areas that would most benefit DHA and provide the highest return of investment. Some vendors may be asked for follow-on meetings after this event to gain more information on how we can work together with Industry to provide innovative solutions for the Military Health System in the future.<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>Requested Information<br />The submitted documentation and content becomes the property of the United States Government and will not be returned. The Government will not reimburse costs associated with preparing the documentation submitted under this request. Responders are solely responsible for all expenses associated with responding to this inquiry. Although solicitation terminology may appear in this inquiry, your response will be treated as information only and will not be used as or considered to be a proposal.</p>
<p>This notice is part of Government market research. Information received as a result of this request will be considered as sensitive and will be protected as such. Any company or industry proprietary information contained in responses should be clearly marked as such, by paragraph, so that publicly releasable and proprietary information are clearly distinguished. Any proprietary information received in response to this request will be properly protected from unauthorized disclosure. The Government will not use proprietary information submitted from any one source to establish the capability and requirements for any future acquisition, so as to inadvertently restrict competition. Information should be provided at the Unclassified level.<br />Responses which do not clearly and completely address the topics below will be considered as submitted for general informational purposes only. Follow-on discussions, briefings or meetings for clarification may be established at a later date at the discretion of the government.</p>
<p>Response Instructions</p>
<p>Responses are limited to 2 (two) single spaced pages, using a searchable MS Word format, 12 pitch, Times New roman, and 1" margins (header, footer and side margins). Insert the name of the topic and the company name into each page's header. Submit white papers to: jackie.l.pinkston.civ@mail.mil and david.t.guillory.civ@mail.mil. Page count does not include cover page, title pages, and table of contents. Proprietary information, if any, should be minimized and MUST BE CLEARLY MARKED IAW FAR 3.104.</p>
<p>Company Information<br />&bull; Business Name<br />&bull; Business Address<br />&bull; Website URL<br />&bull; Proposed presenters (limited to two)<br />o Last, First MI/Title<br />&bull; CAGE Code<br />&bull; DUNS Number<br />&bull; Small or Large Business<br />o If small, list certification programs and socio-economic categories</p>
<p>White Paper Outline<br />&bull; Discussion of Topic of Interest<br />&bull; Value to the DHA<br />&emsp;</p>
<p>Topic List<br />For the purposes of this market research, a company is allowed to select one topic and submit one response from the following list:</p>
<p>1. The DHA is interested in learning about a comprehensive IT discover, capture, and tracking system for resources attached to the Medical Community of Interest (MEDCOI) network, providing on-demand (i.e., near real-time updating) identification and reporting for resources on the network and in the data centers, and for the provisioning of these resources. The DHA is also interested in solutions that integrate existing tool sets deployed for these purposes.</p>
<p>2. The DHA is interested in solutions and strategies that provide for the safe, secure, and effective clinical and functional integration and management of medical devices for the Military Treatment Facilities.</p>
<p>3. The DHA is interested in cloud service strategies and approaches to improve application performance and IT services. Minimum requirements include: FEDRAMP Level IV/potential V, Moderate/Moderate High, requirements, Cloud Infrastructure Stack management, DHA security requirements, and DoD HIPAA privacy and security for IT requirements.</p>
<p>4. The DHA is interested in how industry can assist with transforming our current processes into enterprise processes that are efficient, repeatable and cost sensitive to our shrinking budget: Demonstration should be through the use of a lifecycle cost model and process workflows that show the "as-is" and 'to-be" based on the vendor's solution and model/processes to be implemented. Products of interest are:<br />&bull; Service Desk<br />&bull; SCCM<br />&bull; Desktop support<br />&bull; VDI<br />&bull; Network Operations<br />&bull; The ability to spin up or down capacity and necessary support for servers, SAN storage, and database management</p>
<p>5. The DHA is interested in learning about Telehealth solutions that enhance the ability of clinicians and clinical teams to provide primary, behavioral, specialty, emergent, and critical care to patients in clinic-based, home/community, field, and austere settings. Solutions should assume technical and environmental resources and challenges that would be common to the targeted settings (e.g., intermittent connectivity, limited bandwidth, and potentially harsh environmental conditions in field and austere settings; access to consumer-grade connections in home and community settings). Solutions of interest may be either synchronous or asynchronous, as appropriate to the service being delivered. The intention is to provide tools to improve access, timeliness, and quality of medical, behavioral, health, and health education services to patients, and to improve the medical and behavioral readiness of Service Members and their families. The platform and data must be compliant with DOD, HIPAA, NIST, and DHA standards.</p>
<p>6. The DHA is interested in learning about how to establish an effective organizational cyber governance structure that will provide guidance and policy, and act as an oversight authority for the MHS, as well as the provide tools and technology to facilitate the ongoing management and administration of these processes.</p>
<p>7. The DHA is interested in learning about how to aggregate disparate data sources from across its entire portfolio of systems, registries, and programs of record. We are looking to learn industry best practices on where/how to host the aggregated data, perform analytics, and business intelligence in a consolidated, turnkey and efficient manner. As the DHA matures with these areas of interest we will parlay these efforts to future predictive and proscriptive analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence efforts. Areas of interest include:<br />a. Business Intelligence<br />b. Distributed file systems and clustering <br />c. Data Lakes<br />d. Data Environments in the Cloud<br />e. Data Aggregation<br />f. Data Abstraction</p>
<p>Please provide information on how you would satisfy these requirements, and other information that would be useful to the DHA.</p>
<p>Each presentation has a block of 30 minutes. Each vendor selected will have 15 minutes to present, 10 minutes Q&amp;A among the panel, and 5 minutes to switch for the next vendor's presentation. These times are strict and non-negotiable.</p>
<p>Determination of Eligibility<br />The Government reserves the right to make final determinations as to the mix (numbers, type, capability category, etc.) of small and large business vendors it may choose to invite to participate.</p>
<p>THIS IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ONLY. This RFI is issued solely for information and planning purposes. It does not constitute a solicitation (Request for Proposal) or a promise to issue a solicitation in the future. This RFI does not commit the Government to contract for any supply or service whatsoever. Furthermore, we are not at this time seeking proposals. Responders are advised that the U.S. Government will not pay for any information or administrative costs incurred in response to this RFI. All costs associated with responding to this RFI will be solely at the responding party's expense. While the Government does not encourage responders to submit Proprietary or trade secret information, the Government will handle and safeguard all such appropriately marked information received in response to this RFI in a manner consistent with applicable laws and regulations. The Government shall not be liable for or suffer any consequential damages resulting from the misuse or disclosure of any proprietary or trade secret information that is not properly identified as such.</p>
<p>Responses to this notice are not offers and cannot be accepted by the U.S. Government to form a binding contract or agreement. The Defense Health Agency will not be obligated to pursue any particular acquisition alternative as a result of this RFI. Responses to the RFI will not be returned. Not responding to this RFI does not preclude participation in any future acquisition, if one is initiated.</p>

<DESC><p><strong>The Request for Qualifications is revised in its entirety.&nbsp; Refer to Amendment 02 and the attached revised Request for Qualifications.&nbsp; In addition, the Response date is extended.<br /><br />Request for Qualifications</strong></p>
<p>This acquisition is for a Total Small Business Set&#8208;Aside. The Government will only accept qualifications from small business concerns. All other firms are deemed ineligible to submit offers. The North American Industry Classification (NAICS) Code is 541310.

<p>Architect-Engineer Qualification Statements (SF 330s) submitted in response to this notice will be used to select the most highly qualified A/E for award of an Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract. Professional services include planning, design, construction contract administration, and post construction contract services for various Federal and Tribal health facilities located in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa.

<p>https://www.ihs.gov/des/includes/themes/newihstheme/display_objects/documents/AEDesignGuide2016.pdf</p>
<p>Description: The Government is contemplating awarding three-zoned A/E Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contracts from one solicitation for a one-year Base plus 4 option years with a Not-to-Exceed (NTE) amount of $5 Million for each awarded IDIQ contract. The Respondent will be required to submit Qualification Statements, SF 330s (https://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/116486), for evaluation by the Government. Source selection procedures in accordance with FAR 36.602 will be used.</p>

<p>Background: The Great Plains Area Office in Aberdeen, South Dakota works in conjunction with its 19 federally and tribally managed Service Units to provide health care to approximately 130,000 Native Americans located in North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa. The Area Office's service units include seven hospitals, eight health centers, and several smaller health stations and satellite clinics.</p>
<p>Each facility incorporates a comprehensive health care delivery system. The hospitals, health centers, and satellite clinics provide inpatient and outpatient care and conduct preventive and curative clinics. The Great Plains Area also operates an active research effort through its Area Epidemiology Program. Research projects deal with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and the application of health risk appraisals in all communities.</p>
<p>The respondent shall provide all labor, management, facilities, supplies, equipment and material and complete all actions necessary for performance of the work as defined in each issued task order. Work will include is but not limited to studies, evaluations, design, plans and specification development and technical assistance with all types of building and grounds infrastructure throughout the Great Plains Indian Health Service.</p>
<p>Services include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>a. Evaluations, Assessments, and Planning Services: facility condition assessments; site development feasibility studies; conceptual designs; cost estimating; space planning and space efficiency studies; energy modeling and investment-grade energy feasibilities studies; building systems evaluations; electrical studies including short-circuit coordination studies and evaluation of power quality problems; pre-design commissioning activities; environmental testing and environmental site assessments; geotechnical and soil investigation and testing; water quality analysis; legal survey work for real property transfers including metes and bounds surveys.</p>
<p>b. Design Services: development of design and construction documents (i.e. drawings, specifications) and associated engineering work in accordance with the Indian Health Service "Architect/Engineer (A/E) Design Guide," dated 2016.</p>
<p>c.

<p>e. Integration of Sustainable Features: To the maximum extent possible these scope items shall integrate or include sustainability features that will reduce the energy usage, water usage, reduce emissions, divert solid waste, reduce consumption of toxic materials and chemicals, increase organic waste diversion, ensure retrofitting and renovation promotes building's long term viability, and other sustainable enhancements.</p>
<p>Although it is required that the A&amp;E firm be able to provide the full scope of required services, the (a) Evaluations, Assessments, and Planning Services and (b) Design Services will likely be utilized the most frequently.</p>

<DESC>Request for Proposals #140P8318R0001 is to replace windows, skylights, and exterior doors at the North Cascade Visitor Center.  This building was built in 1991 and is 11,930 square feet. The glass elements to be replaced are original. The building will be closed to the public during construction although NPS employees may work on-site intermittently. Additional details will be provided in the Statement of Work and drawings posted with the Request for Proposals, which will be posted at www.FBO.gov on approximately October 23, 2017.
PROJECT LOCATION: The North Cascades Visitor Center is located in Newhalem, WA, approximately 65 miles east of Sedro-Woolley WA within Ross Lake National Recreation Area. Maps and information are posted at www.nps.gov/NOCA.
SITE VISIT: A group site visit will be held at 11:00 am on November 1, 2017; details in Section L of the solicitation. Attendance at the site visit is strongly encouraged (not mandatory). Requests for individual hosted site visits will not be honored; however, contractors may view the building's exterior and site individually any time. The visitor center is open to the public October 7, 8, 14, 15, 21, 22, and 28, 2017, 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, and then closes until early May, 2018. 
TARGET WORK DATES: The period of performance will be 60 days after commencing on-site work and substantial completion must occur by May 4, 2018. The Notice to Proceed will likely be issued in January and the Contractor may select their on-site starting date. We anticipate that the work will occur in March and April, 2018, due to winter weather conditions at the site.
The entire solicitation package, including drawings and specifications, will be in Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF.

<DESC><strong>See Amendment 0002- An Amendment has been posted to this Solicitation. Additional attachments are available upon request.</strong>&nbsp;
<p><strong>See AMENDMENT 0001 </strong><br /><br />NAWCAD is issuing Solicitation N68335-17-R-0051 to</p>

<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">Farmingdale, NY 11735</p>
<p>The solicitation SF-33 has been attached.&nbsp; Additional documents are available upon request.<br /><br />The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) Lakehurst, NJ on behalf of the US Coast Guard intends to award an Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) fixed price contract, through a limited competition between the following two companies:</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">EDO Corporation</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">Amityville, NY</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">Telephonics Corp</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">Farmingdale, NY 11735</p>
<p style="MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: normal">&nbsp;</p>
<p>The contract ordering period is estimated to be five years. The place of performance is the contractor's facility.</p>
<p>The Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) has been tasked by the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to convert 14 C-27J Cargo Aircraft (currently configured for cargo, transports, and airdrops) into HC-27J Maritime Patrol Aircraft. This will be accomplished by installing the aircraft with approximately 19 separate systems/subsystems, thereby providing the vehicle with missionization capabilities to perform enhanced medium range maritime surveillance and logistical missions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>This procurement requirement is to order up to nineteen (19) Multi-Mode RADAR (MMR) Systems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, engineering technical services (i.e. integration, installation &amp; fielding), and logistics support (i.e. reliability &amp; maintainability data, user &amp; maintenance manuals, publication source data) for use within the USCG HC-27J fleet will be included. Two of the primary requirements for this procurement require that the radar system must be such that it is currently in the USCG inventory and that the radar system is currently integrated with the US Coast Guard Minotaur Mission System Software. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Additionally the USCG requires that all items be state of the market non-developmental items (NDI).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Government Furnished Property will NOT be provided and the USCG requires new procurement equipment only. Responses to RFI- N68335-15-R-0163 verified that there were only two vendors who manufacture the MMR System that meet these requirements.</p>
<p>A limited sources acquisition will be procured under the authority of 10 U.S.C. 2304(c)(1) and as implemented by FAR 6.302-1, "Only One Responsible Source and No Other Type of Supplies or Services will Satisfy Agency Requirements."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The proposed contract action is for supplies or services for which the Government intends to solicit and negotiate with only one source under authority of FAR 6.302. Interested persons may identify their interest and capability to respond to the requirement or submit proposals. This notice of intent is not a request for competitive proposals. However, all proposals received within 15 days after date of publication of this synopsis will be considered by the government. A determination by the Government not to compete this proposed contract based upon responses to this notice is solely within the discretion of the government. Information received will normally be considered solely for the purpose of determining whether to conduct a competitive procurement. Responses to this notice must include the company name, point of contact, address, area code and telephone number, telecopy (fax) number, electronic mail (e-mail) address and company literature sufficient to determine the capability of this company to perform this effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>No phone inquiries will be entertained. Responses shall be made in writing by e-mail to the attention of Ms. Frances Marigliano, Contract Specialist, email: frances.marigliano@navy.mil.</p>

A new 24-strand single-mode outside plant fiber optic cable will be extended from an existing pedestal HHFC402 to the new demarcation point in the new main comm room and will support the data service for all users as well as the new telephone switch. The existing 50-pair coper lines that fed the removed Key System will now terminate at the new demarcation comm room and will be used as backup POTS for the entire building.
 Copper and fiber backbone cabling will be extended from the new main comm room to the new branch comm room as well as the existing comm room on the clinics dental side. A lightning protection system will be provided. The voice and data system will include equipment racks, cabling, combination voice and data outlets, and termination equipment.

High visibility customers include the Pentagon and the White House Communication Agency.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: <br /><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL.

To provide additional flexibility and efficiency, the new requirement for Tier I services moves the place of performance to the contractor's facility with NIPRNet and SIPRNet connectivity.

The 'levels' represent proximity of Service Desk agents to mission partners/customers, whereas the 'tiers' within those levels represent the different skill sets of the service desk agents. The various Tiers provide support that corresponds with levels of proximity to the end user. Tier I is a virtualized service desk with local support provided by dispatch labor. Touch labor only pertains to the DISA internal support network.</p>
<p>Level 1 represents direct user support; Level 2 represents Service Desk-to-Service Desk support; and Level 3 represents external entities' support to the service desk (e.g. software vendor help desk support to internal service desks). This 'level' and 'tier' support model utilizes an enterprise trouble ticket workflow, an enterprise contact management system and knowledge centered support known as the Service Support Environment.</p>
<p>2) Desktop Support Services (Tier II) - provide touch labor services at the DISA site locations. There are approximately 42 site locations within CONUS and OCONUS.</p>
<p>3) Hire contractor personnel that are citizens of the United States who possess a U.S. Secret Clearance.

<p>The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is seeking sources for Global Information Technology (IT) Service Desk Support Services.</p>
<p>CONTRACTING OFFICE ADDRESS:</p>
<p>Defense Information Technology Contracting Organization<br />P.O. Box 549<br />Fort Meade, Maryland 20755</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION:</p>
<p>This is a SOURCES SOUGHT TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION to determine the availability and technical capability of small businesses (including the following subsets, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Certified 8(a), Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses and Woman Owned Small Business) to provide the required services.</p>
<p>The Defense Information Systems Agency is seeking information for potential sources for Global IT Service Desk Support for Tier I (Service Desk Support) and Tier II (Desktop Support) services throughout DISA and its customers. The Tier I services are to be performed at the contractor's facility, but required to be reachable from worldwide customers. Tier II services must be performed at Government facilities, located at 42 site locations within CONUS and OCONUS. This supports approximately 1,750,000 users. The current support environment consists of UNIX and Microsoft Windows systems providing support to Mission Partners user communities on a 24/7/365 basis.<br />The objective is to have a globally accessible Service Desk available to the agency and its customers.</p>
<p>DISA operates and maintains the Agency's internal Information Technology (IT) Enterprise, which provides administrative computing services to the DISA<br />Director, the majority of the Agency's civilian, military and contractor personnel and secure workspaces located within industry partner's commercial facilities. DISA's Information Technology (IT) Enterprise provides internal unclassified, secret, and top secret communications across DISA's worldwide locations. High visibility customers include the Pentagon and the White House Communication Agency.</p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: <br /><br />THIS SOURCES SOUGHT IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THIS IS NOT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL. IT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A SOLICITATION AND SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS A COMMITMENT BY THE GOVERNMENT. RESPONSES IN ANY FORM ARE NOT OFFERS AND THE GOVERNMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO AWARD A CONTRACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. NO FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE TO PAY FOR PREPARATION OF RESPONSES TO THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ANY INFORMATION SUBMITTED BY RESPONDENTS TO THIS TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION IS STRICTLY VOLUNTARY.</p>
<p>CONTRACT/PROGRAM BACKGROUND:</p>
<p>Contract Number/Task Order: HC1047-13-D-4003/0003<br />Contract Type: FFP<br />Incumbent and their size: Unitech Consulting, LLC., Small 8(a)<br />Method of previous acquisition: 8(a) Competitive Set-Aside</p>
<p>Brief description of current effort: The current effort covers five (5) DISA locations that support Tier I (Service Desk) services, while Tier 2 (Desktop Support) services are provided at limited DISA locations. To provide additional flexibility and efficiency, the new requirement for Tier I services moves the place of performance to the contractor's facility with NIPRNet and SIPRNet connectivity. Tier II services will still be required to be performed at the Government facilities but it is required to be extended to support all 42 locations.</p>
<p>REQUIRED CAPABILITIES <br />Please describe your experience delivering the following capabilities:</p>
<p>1) Service Desk Support Services (Tier I) - provide services at a Contractor's U.S. based primary and secondary (COOP) Facility Clearance at the SECRET level IAW DoD 5220.22, National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual. This SECRET level clearance requirement applies to affiliates, team members, subcontractors, etc., that will require access to classified information. All Tier I services provided from the Contractor's US-based primary and secondary (COOP) facilities must have network connectivity to NIPRNet and SIPRNet networks. The contractor's response should confirm that their facility has both NIPR and SIPR access at the time of this sources sought. The contractor's response should also show their ability to provide Service Desk Support on a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year basis to approximately 1.7M users world-wide, either directly or indirectly based on application service level agreement requirements. Most of these users are expected to need Tier 1/Level 1 support and Tier 1 Level 2 support.</p>
<p>These services would support approximately 1,750,000 users across the globe. The current environment operates according to a 'level' and 'tier' support model. The 'levels' represent proximity of Service Desk agents to mission partners/customers, whereas the 'tiers' within those levels represent the different skill sets of the service desk agents. The various Tiers provide support that corresponds with levels of proximity to the end user. Tier I is a virtualized service desk with local support provided by dispatch labor. Touch labor only pertains to the DISA internal support network.</p>
<p>Level 1 represents direct user support; Level 2 represents Service Desk-to-Service Desk support; and Level 3 represents external entities' support to the service desk (e.g. software vendor help desk support to internal service desks). This 'level' and 'tier' support model utilizes an enterprise trouble ticket workflow, an enterprise contact management system and knowledge centered support known as the Service Support Environment.</p>
<p>2) Desktop Support Services (Tier II) - provide touch labor services at the DISA site locations. There are approximately 42 site locations within CONUS and OCONUS.</p>
<p>3) Hire contractor personnel that are citizens of the United States who possess a U.S. Secret Clearance. The contractor must have credible processes that demonstrate a complete and thorough ability to perform complete background checks and security clearances on 100% of contractor personnel.</p>
<p>4) Provide Certified HDI Support Center Analysts</p>
<p>5) Provide certified HDI Desktop Support Technicians (HDI-DST).</p>
<p><br />SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p>Onsite staff will require at least a minimum Secret Security Clearance with IT-1.</p>
<p>SOURCES SOUGHT: <br />The anticipated North American Industry Classification System Code (NAICS) for this requirement is 541513, with the corresponding size standard of $27.5 million. This Sources Sought Synopsis is requesting responses to the following criteria ONLY from small businesses that can provide the required services under the NAICS Code. <br />To assist DISA in making a determination regarding the level of participation by small business in any subsequent procurement that may result from this Sources Sought, you are also encouraged to provide information regarding your plans to use joint venturing (JV) or partnering to meet each of the requirements areas contained herein. This includes responses from qualified and capable Small Businesses, Small Disadvantaged Businesses, Service Disabled-Veteran Owned Small Businesses, Women-owned Small Businesses, and 8(a) companies. You should provide information on how you would envision your company's areas of expertise and those of any proposed JV/partner would be combined to meet the specific requirements contained in this announcement.</p>
<p>In order to make a determination for a small business set-aside, two or more qualified and capable small businesses must submit responses that demonstrate their qualifications.

1. Introduction 
 
To accelerate better and more responsive service to the Veteran, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is making a deliberate shift towards becoming an Application Programming Interface (API) driven digital enterprise. A cornerstone of this effort is the setup of a strategic Open API Program that is adopting an outside-in, value-to-business driven approach to create APIs that are managed as products to be consumed by developers within and outside of VA. 
 
2. Objectives

a. Platform Vision 
 
VA has started the process of establishing an API Management Platform, named Lighthouse.  The purpose of Lighthouse is to establish the Next Generation Open Digital Platform for Veterans, accelerating the transformation in core domains of VA, such as Health, Benefits, Burial and Memorials. This platform will be a system for designing, developing, publishing, operating, monitoring, analyzing, iterating and optimizing VA s API ecosystem. These APIs will allow VA to leverage its investment in various digital assets, support application rationalization, and allow it to decouple outdated systems and replace them with new, commercial, off the shelf, Software as a Service (SaaS) solutions. It will enable creation of new, high value experiences for our Veterans, VA s provider partners, and allow VA s employees to provide better service to Veterans. 
 
In many ways, the Lighthouse API platform is the bedrock of the Open Digital Veteran Platform which will allow VA to achieve the following objectives: 
 
  Integrate more effectively with the community care providers by connecting members of a Veteran s  Care Team  from within and outside the Veterans Health Administration (VHA); and, generate greater opportunities for collaboration across the care continuum with private sector providers, 
  Effectively shift technology development to commercial electronic health record (EHR) and administrative systems vendors that can integrate modular components into the enterprise through open APIs, thus allowing VA to leverage these capabilities to adopt more efficient and effective care management processes, 
  Foster an interoperable, active, innovation ecosystem of solutions and services through its Open API Framework that contributes to the next generation of healthy living and care models that are more precise, personalized, outcome-based, evidence-based, tiered and connected across the continuum of care regardless of where and how care is delivered, 
  Create an open, accessible platform that can be used not only for Veterans care but also for advanced knowledge sharing, clinical decision support, technical expertise, and process interoperability with organizations through the U.S. care delivery system. By simplifying access to the largest data set of clinical data anywhere, albeit de-identified, it will accelerate the discovery and development of new clinical pathways for the benefit of the Veterans and the community at large. 
 
The Lighthouse platform will also generate opportunities to a deploy a single Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system that will help VA manage its relationship with the Veteran through a single lens and provide highly sophisticated ways to engage with the Veteran that includes, web, chat, video, phone and social media.  Through APIs, information that is spread across siloes of legacy systems and databases, will be consolidated into the CRM platform, that will aid VA staff in providing highly personalized experiences by tracking all engagement encounters through a common integrated platform and ensuring 100% closed-loop closure of Veteran requests. This will provide a consistent experience for the Veteran irrespective of the department that the Veteran interacts with. To provide such an experience, the API Platform will need to integrate information from disparate source systems that hosts Veterans data such as Enrollment, Eligibility, Care Requests and Care Plans.  
 
b. Product Roadmap 
 
VA is currently on-track to launch a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) representing the basic components of the Platform as well as APIs representing the Health domain that conforms to the US Core Profiles of the Health Level Seven (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standards. 
 
Beyond the MVP, VA will grow and extend the platform to support: 
  The API Gateway, through creating the facades for common, standard Health APIs will allow multiple EHRs to freely and predictably interoperate with each other as VA deploys the COTS EHR through the enterprise and finds itself with multiple EHR's during the transition and stabilization phases of the implementation. 
  Establish the Single Point of Interoperability with health exchanges and EHR systems of Community Care Providers. 
  The development of APIs across the enterprise spanning additional domains following a federated development approach that can see an exponential growth in the number APIs offered by the platform.  
  Operate at scale to support the entire population of Veterans, VA Employees and Community Providers that provide a variety of services to the Veterans 
 
c. Objectives 
 
The objective is to operate and grow the Lighthouse API Platform, which at its core is currently built on MuleSoft s API Gateway Management platform. Lighthouse presents a straight forward and usable way for developers to consume APIs that hide the complexities of backend systems. The Lighthouse API Gateway has adopted a facade pattern that provides a simple interface to multiple complex subsystems, including its most complex subsystem, the VistA EHR. Its purpose is to articulate internal systems and make them useful for a variety of application developers. 
 
Traditional Service Oriented Architecture strategy uses a standards committee approach in the development of Enterprise Interfaces. VA has, in the past, used this approach. While there are certain advantages to using such an approach, such as, creating a sense of unification across many stakeholders and contributors, the major drawback to the approach is that it is very slow. VA s objective is to distribute the development of endpoints so that a single team does not become a bottleneck. This also eliminates the need for a team to have expertise on every backend system before it can develop the endpoints. With this approach, each domain team, with expertise in their specific backend systems that support their domain would take a product management approach to their APIs, where the APIs are their products. They could then obtain feedback from the  market    both internal or external teams   and proactively offer APIs for this demand. These APIs will then be published and accessible on the Lighthouse API platform. 

To achieve such an objective, VA envisions an API Program Core Team (Contractor) that will establish core processes, policies and framework for distributed, federated development of APIs. Whereas the domain teams will be responsible for the complete life cycle of APIs and will include the planning, design, implementation, publication, maintenance and retirement of APIs in their specific domains, the API Program core team will be responsible for operating the platform at scale, through established Service Level Agreements with the VA, as a Private Software as a Service that will conform to Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Federal Information Security management Act (FISMA) High security standards. 

3. Response

To establish objectives of such a team in this RFI, VA is gauging existing industry experience with MuleSoft s API Gateway Management platform, which the Lighthouse MVP utilizes, and is looking for specific guidance and suggestions that could include but are not limited to addressing the areas below.  Please limit responses to 20 pages.  Please do not submit general capabilities or marketing materials.
